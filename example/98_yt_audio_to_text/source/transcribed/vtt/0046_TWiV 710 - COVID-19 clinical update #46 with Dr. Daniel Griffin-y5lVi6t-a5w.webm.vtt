 This week in virology, the podcast about viruses, the kind that make you sick.

00:10.320 --> 00:21.280
 From MicroTV, this is Twiv, this week in virology, episode 710 recorded on January 21, 2021.

00:21.280 --> 00:27.680
 I'm Vincent Racken Yello, and you're listening to the podcast all about viruses. Joining me today

00:27.680 --> 00:34.640
 from New York, Daniel Griffin. Hello, everyone. Clinical update number 46, Daniel. I have a

00:34.640 --> 00:42.560
 feeling we're going to pass 50. Unfortunately, we are. We will not be through this in four weeks,

00:43.120 --> 00:47.360
 but I am going to be positive today. So let me start off. We have a lot to cover. I want to

00:47.360 --> 00:52.560
 make sure we hit it all. And I know people are busy. You can listen to this at 1.5 or 2x if that

00:52.560 --> 01:00.320
 helps, but two quotations by the same individual. The greatness of a community is most accurately

01:00.320 --> 01:06.160
 measured by the compassionate action of its members. And the other same person, struggle

01:06.160 --> 01:13.280
 is a never-ending process. Freedom is never really won. You earn it and win it every generation.

01:13.280 --> 01:20.560
 And this was by Coretta Scott King, the wife of Martin Luther King. And I bring these up sort

01:20.560 --> 01:25.360
 of as we go forward. You'll see where I get with this, but I think that we've been talking a lot

01:25.360 --> 01:32.080
 about vaccinations, making sure that we are doing this in a compassionate manner. I don't think

01:32.080 --> 01:36.880
 people have tried to not do it that way, but there's been a lot of really difficult issues,

01:36.880 --> 01:42.240
 particularly for seniors, striving long distances, struggling through a really difficult process

01:42.800 --> 01:47.760
 to get appointments, ending up showing up, and there's no vaccines. We'll get into that.

01:47.760 --> 01:53.200
 But I think the others also struggle as a never-ending process. I want to remind people as we get

01:53.200 --> 01:59.840
 through this, as we're like right now, really in really difficult times, we need to be vigilant.

01:59.840 --> 02:06.800
 We need to continue to fight for that situation we are hoping to get to, where we are free from

02:06.800 --> 02:11.120
 this pandemic, so that this never happens again. So I think we want to remember that.

02:11.120 --> 02:17.280
 So my three quotations, my rules, I will call them, never miss an opportunity to vaccinate,

02:17.280 --> 02:21.840
 never miss an opportunity to test, and never miss an opportunity to be nice.

02:22.640 --> 02:26.960
 These are difficult times. People's tempers have been quite a little bit short. If we're

02:26.960 --> 02:31.680
 going to get through the next few months, we have to work together. We have to be collegial,

02:31.680 --> 02:37.840
 we have to communicate. All right, this is where I say if you're on the wrong airplane,

02:37.840 --> 02:44.160
 if you're headed to LA, and that's not your final destination get off, I'm going to talk a lot

02:44.160 --> 02:49.280
 about vaccination. So if you don't want to hear about vaccination, turn it off now, switch,

02:50.480 --> 02:59.120
 go do something else. So as far as active vaccination, I want to say, I try not to talk

02:59.120 --> 03:02.960
 that much about vaccine hesitancy because I feel like that's what's going to be the

03:02.960 --> 03:07.920
 challenge in the future. But I do think it's critical that as physicians, we take responsibility

03:07.920 --> 03:13.680
 for answering questions about vaccinations. I think there has been a brilliant mistake at

03:13.680 --> 03:19.120
 many healthcare systems to think that healthcare workers would not need their questions answered

03:19.120 --> 03:24.480
 about vaccinations. They should know already. And we've seen really a significant difference

03:24.480 --> 03:31.360
 in success based upon people taking the time to educate healthcare workers about vaccines.

03:32.080 --> 03:38.320
 UCSF, well over 80%, when they first said, hey, we've got vaccines, they said, when can I get what?

03:38.320 --> 03:44.720
 Mass General, it was in the mid 70s, pro health, I think I mentioned it was over 90% when the call

03:44.720 --> 03:50.080
 came out who wants to get vaccinated. But we're hearing that some of the large healthcare systems

03:50.080 --> 03:55.120
 here in New York that less than half of their providers and staff are signing up to be vaccinated.

03:55.120 --> 03:59.760
 So just because someone's in healthcare doesn't mean they don't have questions that need to be

03:59.760 --> 04:04.960
 answered. And I think if we don't give the education, if we don't answer the questions and the public

04:04.960 --> 04:09.600
 starts seeing that healthcare providers are not getting vaccinated, that's going to come back to

04:09.600 --> 04:16.560
 haunt us down the road. And now this is sort of an FAQ. I get so many questions about vaccines,

04:16.560 --> 04:22.400
 so I'm going to start hitting them here. Because remember, this is my chance to answer the questions

04:22.400 --> 04:27.920
 for all the curious pro health clinicians and our listening audience. It saves me a ton of

04:27.920 --> 04:33.600
 texts and emails a day. But one of the first questions, are we underselling the benefits of

04:33.600 --> 04:38.640
 the vaccines? So there's a really nice piece in the New York Times, underselling the vaccine

04:39.360 --> 04:46.000
 by David Leonhart. And they quoted our buddy Paul Hotez. If you're an anti-vaxxer and you're still

04:46.000 --> 04:51.760
 tuning in, he's the one that likes to get your messages. He draws a parallel, David does,

04:52.560 --> 04:57.920
 between underselling the vaccines and sort of the early mask wearing we don't quite know yet,

04:57.920 --> 05:06.080
 etc. I don't know if that holds completely true. We try not to get ahead of the science. And I

05:06.080 --> 05:12.960
 know that bothers people, but we as scientists, we as as clinicians, the vaccines appear to be

05:12.960 --> 05:18.640
 really effective. We are really thinking that they're going to have an impact on transmission.

05:18.640 --> 05:23.680
 We don't have the transmission data yet. But I'm going to talk a little about sort of the advice.

05:23.680 --> 05:28.320
 Because yeah, why is everyone saying I still have to wear a mask? We're just saying that now.

05:28.320 --> 05:36.480
 We are hoping we will be able to change. Should a person wait 90 days after acute infection

05:36.480 --> 05:44.560
 before they get that vaccination? Well, what does the CDC as per the CDC, there's no recommended

05:44.560 --> 05:51.520
 minimal interval between infection and vaccination. So some physicians are recommending people wait

05:51.520 --> 05:56.480
 months after infection get vaccinated. But I have to say several people, including Tom Frieden,

05:56.480 --> 06:02.480
 Eleanor Murray up at Boston University. And I'm going to jump in on this too. I am concerned.

06:02.480 --> 06:07.760
 We are concerned that when you tell people to wait 90 days, right now they're all excited.

06:07.760 --> 06:12.000
 They want to get vaccinated. I don't know how they're going to feel in 90 days. You don't want

06:12.000 --> 06:16.560
 to feed the anti-vax movement. There's no science that says you have to wait. Person feels fine.

06:16.560 --> 06:22.560
 They've recovered from their infection. My answer is in line, I'll say with the CDC, which is back.

06:22.560 --> 06:29.040
 Welcome back CDC. You know, never miss an opportunity to vaccinate. If you say wait three months,

06:29.040 --> 06:34.960
 you are missing that opportunity. Let's not do that. I have heard people who previously had

06:34.960 --> 06:40.320
 COVID and then had a bad reaction to the vaccine, right? Sort of feeds into that first one. Should

06:40.320 --> 06:48.160
 people who have had COVID still get vaccinated? And again, the CDC is very clear here on encouraging

06:48.160 --> 06:54.400
 all to get vaccinated. We've definitely seen people have reactogenicity. So significant

06:54.400 --> 07:00.000
 reactions after the vaccine. Some of those people had COVID before. Some of the people did not.

07:00.640 --> 07:06.800
 So only anecdotes. Millions of people have been vaccinated. No clear science to support this

07:06.800 --> 07:12.640
 fear. So when you hear, oh, I had COVID and I had a bad reaction. There's a there's a matching person

07:12.640 --> 07:20.960
 who never had COVID and had a rough reaction. So people who are not vaccinated. We're concerned

07:20.960 --> 07:25.920
 that can get reinfected. We're concerns that just because your first time with COVID wasn't so bad.

07:26.720 --> 07:33.840
 Maybe the second time will be worse. So I've certainly certainly seen people who had COVID

07:33.840 --> 07:42.080
 earlier on. And we've certainly seen many reports of reinfection. So the vaccine protection is better

07:42.080 --> 07:48.160
 than natural exposure. If a person had a severe reaction from the first vaccination, what should

07:48.160 --> 07:53.680
 they expect from the second shot? So in general, and this is what the science suggested when we

07:53.680 --> 07:59.600
 have the early studies. This is what our experience is reinforcing. The first reaction, whatever you

07:59.600 --> 08:04.000
 get, it's usually a little bit more significant the second time. So if they'll kind of achy a

08:04.000 --> 08:08.720
 little tired the first time, you will probably feel a little more achy, a little more tired

08:08.720 --> 08:15.280
 the second time. If that reaction was rather severe, then I think it's reasonable for that person to

08:15.280 --> 08:21.840
 have a conversation with an educated person, a physician, I'm going to say here, who is familiar

08:21.840 --> 08:27.760
 with with this situation. I've done several consultations. And I think this makes sense. I

08:27.760 --> 08:30.960
 mean, a lot of people don't want to be heard of like cattle. They don't want to be marched

08:30.960 --> 08:35.200
 through the Javits Center. Particularly, I'll say older individuals, they may want to sit down.

08:35.200 --> 08:38.880
 They may want to have a conversation with their primary care physician or infectious

08:38.880 --> 08:44.320
 disease specialist, someone familiar with vaccination. People want to talk to their doctors. That's

08:44.320 --> 08:49.200
 fine. And actually, I encourage that. And I think this feeds into what I talked up front about.

08:50.080 --> 08:54.560
 We haven't tried to do this. We haven't tried to be cruel. We haven't tried to make this process

08:54.560 --> 08:59.760
 difficult. But in a lot of ways, it has been difficult. Particularly now, as we've rolled it out to

08:59.760 --> 09:05.520
 older individuals, I describe the situation where my mom, unfortunately, had some challenges.

09:06.320 --> 09:10.800
 And you know, just here she is in a strange situation. She's not with a health care provider,

09:10.800 --> 09:16.800
 she trusts. I described an individual in his 80s who drove two and a half hours to Mount Sinai,

09:16.800 --> 09:22.960
 only to find out that the vaccines have been taken to the Javits Center. We need to do a better job.

09:22.960 --> 09:27.520
 And I think that's about to happen. That's the optimism here. We are about to have a really

09:27.520 --> 09:34.560
 good national plan. And that's what I'm hearing. What about people that had multi-system inflammatory

09:34.560 --> 09:38.960
 issues with COVID? Should they get vaccinated? And I had a very interesting

09:40.000 --> 09:45.520
 individual that I took care of this last weekend. It's actually a physician that I know. And we took

09:45.520 --> 09:50.480
 care of him back in April, when he actually developed what we believe was an autoimmune,

09:50.480 --> 09:57.600
 mediated ataxia. He ended up with steroids IVG then. He actually developed those symptoms

09:57.600 --> 10:05.680
 about 14 days into his acute illness. Back in December, he got his vaccine. And about 14

10:05.680 --> 10:10.240
 days later, he noticed that he was having trouble writing. He noticed his eyes were sort of wandering

10:10.240 --> 10:17.360
 a little bit, noticed a little bit of ataxia. Tried to set him up in the outpatient setting for

10:17.360 --> 10:23.840
 steroids and IVG. Welcome to the world of private insurance. Pre-offs were required.

10:23.840 --> 10:28.000
 He ended up requiring hospitalization to get that therapy. He is feeling better.

10:28.640 --> 10:36.160
 So a person who has severe COVID the first time around or had what we think was an auto

10:36.560 --> 10:41.440
 antibody-mediated issue, that's an individual who should consult with a physician. That makes

10:41.440 --> 10:46.880
 sense. Consult with a physician, come up with a plan. I guess that's a recurring theme. I don't

10:46.880 --> 10:51.920
 think everyone needs to... We saw a little bit of a disaster at Jones Beach, where you had all

10:51.920 --> 10:58.720
 these older individuals sitting for hours in this line of cars, waiting for sort of the hurting

10:58.720 --> 11:03.360
 cattle car approach to vaccination. That's fine for some people, but a lot of other people need a

11:03.360 --> 11:07.760
 different setting for them to have vaccination. A lot of people would probably need something

11:07.760 --> 11:11.840
 where there's a home visit, where someone can come to the home. There's a lot of homebound

11:11.840 --> 11:17.600
 individuals. This is the big one. I get this all the time. I think I get this because people don't

11:17.600 --> 11:22.640
 like my answer and they want to hear a new one. Do I still need to wear a mask if all my friends

11:22.640 --> 11:30.160
 have been vaccinated? Now, this really comes down to the issue as I talked about. We do not have

11:30.160 --> 11:35.520
 the science yet to tell us about transmissibility, but let's run through a couple scenarios.

11:35.520 --> 11:41.280
 I'm going to use my mom again. I think she likes that I talk about her. Here's a woman in her 80s.

11:42.160 --> 11:48.400
 My youngest brother, Ben, he has twins, and he just had a new baby over the last year. My mother

11:48.400 --> 11:54.960
 is dying to go down and see him. When she has gotten her second shot and two weeks go by,

11:55.600 --> 12:00.320
 is it okay for her to go down to visit my younger brother, to hug her grandchildren?

12:00.320 --> 12:07.200
 From her perspective, she's safe. I'm going to say, mom, you can go. Now, my brother has to

12:07.200 --> 12:11.760
 look at the fact that my mom, even though she's vaccinated, she still potentially could get

12:11.760 --> 12:17.440
 transmit to him. But I think we need to start looking at this. A lot of older individuals,

12:17.440 --> 12:21.600
 and I'm going to live forever. They've missed a lot of really important things.

12:21.600 --> 12:25.040
 Do they want to get out of the house? Do they want to hug their kids? Do they want to have that

12:25.040 --> 12:32.000
 at human contact? The vaccine really protects them. They're in the bulletproof car. The rest of

12:32.000 --> 12:37.200
 the people that are not vaccinated still still at risk don't think a vaccinated person is less at

12:37.200 --> 12:42.000
 risk. And that also relates the same to quarantine issues. If someone's been vaccinated, and now

12:42.000 --> 12:46.880
 they're exposed to someone, all the quarantine stuff applies. When I'm so much worried about

12:46.880 --> 12:55.680
 them, it's, again, worried about transmission risk. So if you had a reaction to an mRNA vaccine,

12:55.680 --> 13:00.640
 then is it fine to just go ahead with the J&J vaccine? Because everyone thinks that's about to

13:01.280 --> 13:07.440
 come out and get EUA in the coming weeks. Now, it's not entirely clear that it's safe to

13:07.440 --> 13:11.760
 just go ahead with the J&J. And one of the issues is that we think a lot of the allergic

13:11.760 --> 13:17.680
 reactions are due to PEG, polyethylene glycol 2000. And there's a very similar

13:18.880 --> 13:24.400
 polysorbate that is in the adenoviral vaccine. So there may be some cross reactivity.

13:25.840 --> 13:32.000
 We don't know, just to say we don't know, we do think that the protein vaccine by Novavax

13:32.640 --> 13:37.040
 will sort of be safer because it's not going to have it in there. But one of the things I'm

13:37.040 --> 13:43.680
 going to say, we'll end up talking a lot about J&J. The J&J platform has been given to over 200,000

13:43.680 --> 13:50.320
 people. We are not seeing the significant level of the anaphylactic and allergic reactions we're

13:50.320 --> 13:54.880
 seeing with the mRNA vaccine. So I want to throw that in there. This will be a judgment call.

13:54.880 --> 13:59.280
 Again, you got a bad reaction with the first vaccine. You're going to have to make a decision

13:59.280 --> 14:02.880
 with someone knowledgeable. And you want to probably consider getting that vaccine in a setting

14:02.880 --> 14:07.440
 where you can have a longer observation period and be treated if you have any issue.

14:09.040 --> 14:16.160
 Now, this is going to be sort of an operational in the weeds. We are trying not to throw out

14:16.160 --> 14:19.920
 additional doses. So what happens? And I want to sort of describe this for people.

14:20.960 --> 14:25.280
 We're going to be doing our second round of vaccinations for pro health. We did what we

14:25.280 --> 14:30.240
 were supposed to write. We got our 1,200 vaccines. And we immediately gave all those 1,200 vaccines

14:30.240 --> 14:33.600
 to all our employees, and they're gone. We didn't put any in the freezer. I mean,

14:34.320 --> 14:39.200
 I don't think that surprises any of our listeners, but I am a big fan of vaccines go into people's

14:39.200 --> 14:46.560
 arms, not into freezers. Now, we are going to get our next shipment on Tuesday. It's arriving. And

14:46.560 --> 14:52.240
 this is a change. We actually were told ahead of time yesterday, we actually were told,

14:52.240 --> 14:57.200
 hey, by the way, just to confirm you will be getting your second dose vaccines coming next

14:57.200 --> 15:03.120
 Tuesday. Now, when we did our first vaccines, what we saw several times was that instead of

15:03.120 --> 15:08.000
 there being just 10 doses in the bio, there might be 11. You might actually have a bio with 12 doses.

15:08.640 --> 15:14.240
 So in certain circumstances, instead of doing just 10 people, we did that 11th person. We're

15:14.240 --> 15:20.400
 now hoping now, right, when we get our second 1,200 doses, do we have those extra few doses

15:20.400 --> 15:24.800
 that we gave to people? And again, as the issue, like let's say it's the first night,

15:24.800 --> 15:31.440
 and I worked at one place with that long beach. And I was there for a couple hours and I did 31

15:31.440 --> 15:35.440
 vaccinations, right? So that was three vials. One of the vials had an extra dose. So we got that

15:35.440 --> 15:42.400
 31st person. I am hoping that things work in our favor. We also have 31. But what if we have a

15:42.400 --> 15:49.120
 vial, which has only 10, 10, 10? What do we do with that extra person? We don't want to send

15:49.120 --> 15:54.320
 them away. Do you open another vial? This is where we're talking about coordination. We're actually

15:54.320 --> 15:59.440
 going to set up a call center so that people can say, okay, I don't want to open a new vial

15:59.440 --> 16:05.200
 for one person. But if you drive 15 minutes, our free port site will have a vaccine. So people

16:05.200 --> 16:09.760
 really need to be thinking through the logistics here. We do not want to throw vaccines to the

16:09.760 --> 16:15.360
 trash. And I'm going to quote George Benjamin, the president of the American Public Health

16:15.360 --> 16:21.920
 Association. Principle number one is don't waste the vaccines. I'm very excited. I have to say

16:21.920 --> 16:26.960
 that Dr. Kessler is going to be the head of the Biden Task Force. He's been talking a lot about

16:26.960 --> 16:33.280
 improving the operations of getting vaccines out there. We're expected to have transparency

16:33.280 --> 16:40.080
 on how many doses are produced, where those doses are. And at the end, we really want to

16:40.080 --> 16:44.960
 increase the efficiency. And he uses the analogy of the airplane. I feel like maybe we use that

16:44.960 --> 16:50.720
 here. You know, you find out we've got most of the people in first class boarded. But somebody's

16:50.720 --> 16:55.440
 running 15 minutes late. You start boarding the rest of the airplane. And when that person who

16:55.440 --> 17:00.320
 shows up 15 minutes late, you get them in as well. Let's make things move forward. Let's make this

17:00.320 --> 17:06.320
 efficient. Let's move away from this, you know, threat of punishment when you do things wrong

17:06.880 --> 17:11.040
 to getting those doses in people's arms and the dialect being how can we help.

17:12.000 --> 17:15.680
 All right, that's it for vaccines, active vaccines.

17:15.680 --> 17:22.240
 Now, what about the pre-exposure period, right? Just want to hit a little bit on testing.

17:22.960 --> 17:30.160
 There was a Bynax now antigen test sensitivity for culture positive specimens

17:30.960 --> 17:41.440
 showed a 92.6% and a 78.6% for those symptomatic and asymptomatic. So again, sort of reinforcing

17:41.440 --> 17:47.840
 that people who have a high level of virus, people who are in that infectious period that the antigen

17:48.480 --> 17:55.200
 is actually really a great way of picking those folks up. This was in the MMWR. So it's nice to

17:55.200 --> 17:59.120
 get a little more information. I don't think we have as much information as we would like on

17:59.120 --> 18:05.200
 asymptomatic persons using our testing technology. So great to have a little more information there.

18:05.200 --> 18:11.600
 Now we get up to passive vaccination. So here we are. We're the period of detectable viral

18:11.600 --> 18:18.720
 replication. A person has symptoms. It's week one. What can we do during week one? If the person

18:18.720 --> 18:25.760
 meets criteria, this is when we jump in with our monoclonal antibody therapy. So we heard a little

18:25.760 --> 18:32.160
 bit about bamlinibimab, the Mayo experience greater than 2,000 patients. And then they're

18:32.160 --> 18:39.280
 suggesting an efficacy of 70% and a mortality benefit. But I'm also going to talk a little bit.

18:39.280 --> 18:44.400
 This is an exciting day. We're recording this on the 21st of January. But we actually got a

18:44.400 --> 18:50.880
 little more information from Eli Lilly. And they actually released some data where they were

18:50.880 --> 19:00.160
 looking at giving this antibody, bam, bam, bamlinibimab, to nursing homes. So residents and staff at

19:00.160 --> 19:07.280
 skilled nursing and assisted living facilities. And what they did is this was a study 965 participants

19:07.280 --> 19:13.680
 start off with a baseline negative for SARS-CoV-2 virus. So there were 299 residents. There were

19:13.680 --> 19:21.840
 666 staff. And basically they're following to who gets infected and does anyone die? And they

19:21.840 --> 19:26.720
 actually in this, which right now it's still the press release stage. I'll be excited when I see

19:26.720 --> 19:35.600
 per review. But the residents randomized to bamlinibimab had an 80% lower risk of developing COVID-19.

19:36.880 --> 19:42.880
 The individuals in the placebo group, there were four deaths. There were zero deaths in the

19:42.880 --> 19:48.880
 residents that received the bamlinibimab. And those were four deaths due to COVID. So continuing to

19:48.880 --> 19:55.120
 get more information on the bamlinibimab, we have our trial up and running at United in research.

19:55.120 --> 20:00.560
 We've already been infusing people in home. So we're hoping to get more and more information.

20:00.560 --> 20:05.840
 So people go to United in research. It's the lead study there. They pre-register while they're

20:05.840 --> 20:12.560
 still healthy. And then if an individual develops COVID, the system is activated. And we are giving

20:12.560 --> 20:17.840
 in-home infusions, which ideally is when this therapy and how this therapy should be given.

20:18.800 --> 20:22.720
 All right. The early inflammatory phase, I'm going to hit on vitamin D again.

20:22.720 --> 20:29.520
 Nice article. Vitamin D status is associated with in-hospital mortality and mechanical ventilation,

20:29.520 --> 20:34.320
 a cohort of COVID-19 hospitalized patients. And this was Mayo Clinic proceedings.

20:35.520 --> 20:42.160
 Retrospective observational cohort study. Done it to tertiary academic medical centers in Boston

20:42.720 --> 20:49.200
 and New York. Eligible patients had to be hospitalized. And they basically broke them down into people

20:49.200 --> 20:55.520
 that had very high vitamin D levels, so greater than 30 nanograms per milliliter and people that

20:55.520 --> 21:02.080
 had very low, so say less than 30 nanograms per milliliter. So people that had very high levels,

21:02.080 --> 21:11.520
 9.2% mortality, people that had low levels, 25.3% mortality. So we're actually seeing, again,

21:11.520 --> 21:16.880
 at least when you come in, it's very predictive, actually predictive for need for mechanical ventilation.

21:16.880 --> 21:24.720
 So keep those vitamin D levels up. Again, we do not know. We've seen studies both ways on

21:24.720 --> 21:28.640
 once you get into the hospital, but we're trying to avoid that, trying to keep people out of the

21:28.640 --> 21:34.160
 hospital. Again, we don't know that if you prospectively brought people's levels up, brought it down,

21:34.160 --> 21:39.200
 or if this is more of a marker for something else, but just more information out there on vitamin D.

21:39.200 --> 21:46.400
 Anti-quagulation. I know I talked a little bit last time about the full dose. Anti-quagulation

21:46.400 --> 21:53.520
 was removed from some of the ACTIV trials, but now we actually saw intermediate dose,

21:53.520 --> 22:01.440
 anti-quagulation, aspirin, and in-hospital mortality in COVID-19, a propensity score-matched analysis.

22:02.160 --> 22:08.960
 This came out as a preprint from some researchers and clinicians up at Yale. And we know that

22:08.960 --> 22:16.160
 clotting complications are common. We know that this is a major issue in COVID, and some degree

22:16.160 --> 22:22.240
 of anti-quagulation is standard, but we're still trying to clarify what dose, what agent. Nice to

22:22.240 --> 22:29.360
 see a little data here, more data here on aspirin being thrown into the mix here. And they actually

22:29.360 --> 22:34.480
 were looking, they were comparing intermediate, which is sort of, we'll say, if you're going to use

22:34.480 --> 22:39.440
 low-molecoate heparin, clinicians are listening in now, instead of the once a day, you might go up

22:39.440 --> 22:46.000
 to twice a day. That's our intermediate. We might go up to twice a day for weight-based dosing.

22:46.640 --> 22:52.560
 And this study actually suggested that there was a benefit to intermediate dosing, also a benefit

22:52.560 --> 22:57.600
 to being on aspirin, so sort of using intermediate, slightly higher-dose anti-quagulation, not full

22:57.600 --> 23:04.640
 dose, and anti-aspirate as well. All right, what about IL-6 receptor inhibition? I know it's been

23:04.640 --> 23:12.080
 a while since I've talked about tosyllizumab, but we have some new data out. The REM cap,

23:12.080 --> 23:18.560
 interleukin-6 receptor antagonist in critically ill patients with COVID-19, a preliminary report.

23:19.520 --> 23:26.160
 So this was a randomized embedded multi-factorial adaptive platform trial for community acquired

23:26.160 --> 23:35.040
 pneumonia, so you get your REM-CAP, and adult patients with COVID-19 within 24 hours of

23:35.040 --> 23:40.960
 commencing organ support in an ICU. So we're looking here at timing. We're also looking at a

23:40.960 --> 23:46.720
 background of steroids. So over 93% of these people had a background of steroids. We're going to

23:46.720 --> 23:52.880
 hit on that again. But it wasn't being given to people in late stage. It wasn't given to people

23:52.880 --> 23:58.080
 particularly early. It was given right when we saw an escalation of, I'm going to say,

23:58.080 --> 24:03.520
 the cytokine storm. So the timing was what we've talked about. People were either randomized to

24:03.520 --> 24:10.480
 receive the tosyllizumab or seruleumab, another IL-6 receptor antagonist, or standard of care.

24:11.040 --> 24:19.840
 And the primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. So this is hospital mortality was 28% for people

24:19.840 --> 24:26.400
 that got tosy, 22% for people that got seruleumab, and 36% for controls.

24:27.440 --> 24:35.200
 So this gives us about a 22 to a 38% reduction in mortality, statistically significant.

24:35.840 --> 24:41.760
 So again, the advantages of this trial background, pre-medication with steroids. The tosyllizumab

24:41.760 --> 24:47.680
 is given what most of us have said for a while here is the right stage during the early inflammatory

24:47.680 --> 24:54.480
 stage, people that are progressing. And actually about 30% of the folks got a second dose of tosyllizumab.

24:55.120 --> 25:01.440
 So just to sort of recap here, we now have the impact to trial with a 44% reduction in need

25:01.440 --> 25:06.800
 for mechanical intervention with use of tosy in a background of steroids. The covecta trial

25:06.800 --> 25:12.560
 demonstrating a reduction in hospital duration. And now the REMCAP data showing a rather impressive

25:12.560 --> 25:19.040
 mortality benefit if given after steroids with attention to timing. And now we're waiting for

25:19.040 --> 25:27.120
 the recovery trial. Now on one slash 11, January 11, the recovery trial, independent data monitoring

25:27.120 --> 25:32.400
 committee recommended continuing recruitment to their tosyllizumab treatment arm. So that's

25:32.400 --> 25:38.160
 encouraging. This is going to give us data on about 3000 individuals with a background of steroids

25:38.160 --> 25:43.120
 in COVID in the UK. So at least when they looked over, they were not seeing any reason why they

25:43.120 --> 25:47.920
 should stop. So that will be helpful to really clarify the role and timing of tosyllizumab.

25:49.040 --> 25:54.480
 Okay, the secondary infection phase. Another nice article prevalence of

25:54.480 --> 26:00.720
 co-infection at the time of hospital admission in COVID-19 patients, a multi-center study.

26:00.720 --> 26:06.880
 This is an open form infectious disease. Yes, that is a fine journal reporting they looked at

26:06.880 --> 26:13.520
 over 1000 patients. And at the time of admission, only about 1% had what they felt were bacterial

26:13.520 --> 26:19.920
 respiratory co-infections, reinforcing looking at this disease as far as timing. When people come

26:19.920 --> 26:26.400
 in the door, it is really uncommon, less than 10%, maybe closer to 1%. If there's a bacterial

26:26.400 --> 26:32.800
 process going on, it's the later stage. It's week three when we really start seeing the infections.

26:32.800 --> 26:38.720
 And at that point, we see combination. We see a lot of bacterimias, we see pneumonias,

26:38.720 --> 26:44.480
 we see incidents of fungal. Multi-system inflammatory phase comes sort of at that.

26:44.480 --> 26:49.520
 It's important to keep reinforcing the bi-modal aspect of the inflammatory process. We have

26:49.520 --> 26:53.840
 the early inflammatory, and then we have the late or the multi-system inflammatory phase.

26:54.560 --> 26:58.640
 We haven't been hearing much about this. I don't know if there's so much any more

26:58.640 --> 27:03.920
 new news as much as now we appreciate this. We're addressing it sometimes children,

27:03.920 --> 27:08.240
 sometimes adults. We don't even see them in the hospital. Initially, they come in just

27:08.240 --> 27:14.480
 during this late stage. The tail phase, a number more studies. I actually really appreciate the

27:14.480 --> 27:23.040
 attention here. One of the studies was COVID-19 post acute care study group persistent symptoms

27:23.040 --> 27:28.880
 in patients after acute COVID. That was in JAMA looking at 143 Italian patients hospitalized

27:28.880 --> 27:35.600
 for COVID-19. Eighty-three percent continued to have at least one symptom. Sixty days post

27:35.600 --> 27:41.760
 discharge, right? So reinforcing this isn't you just get better. Another study, COVID-19 symptoms,

27:41.760 --> 27:46.960
 longitudinal evolution and persistent in outpatient settings in the annals of internal medicine.

27:46.960 --> 27:53.920
 This was 669 Swiss patients with positive tests for COVID-19. Mostly outpatients, right? So

27:53.920 --> 28:01.360
 32 percent continued to have at least one symptom at a mean of 43 days after discharge. So even

28:01.360 --> 28:07.680
 your mild folks, even your outpatients, continuing to see symptoms here. So let's want to thank

28:07.680 --> 28:13.200
 everyone for taking the time. We're still doing our fundraiser, still trying to help the P-score

28:13.200 --> 28:19.280
 HIV and AIDS program. So go to parasiteswithoutborders.com, go to donate and help us continue to do what

28:19.280 --> 28:23.680
 we're doing as well as support the P-score. All right, Daniel, a couple questions. I had one

28:23.680 --> 28:28.240
 and you partially answered, but let me just confirm. So if someone is fully vaccinated,

28:28.240 --> 28:31.920
 two doses and they're exposed to someone, you said they should still be quarantined,

28:31.920 --> 28:35.360
 but that is a nine day, not a 14 day quarantine. Is that correct?

28:35.360 --> 28:44.000
 So quarantine versus isolated. So, you know, I try to make the distinction and it really only

28:44.000 --> 28:50.560
 matters in certain states. So, you know, the CDC has made it 10 and 10. They've lined them

28:50.560 --> 28:55.520
 right up. So if you're infected, you wait 10 days. Actually, it was a really nice study showing

28:56.080 --> 29:01.840
 that after nine days, you're really not seeing, they were not able to culture virus, right? So that

29:01.840 --> 29:07.200
 was really good on the isolated for the infected. The quarantine, this has gotten a little bit.

29:07.200 --> 29:12.480
 The CDC said, let's just use the 10 days. They've even talked about a seven day test out,

29:12.480 --> 29:17.120
 where you just you quarantine for seven days. If you're still feeling fine at day seven, you get

29:17.120 --> 29:23.040
 a test. You can end your quarantine early. You could just wait for 10 if you don't want to test

29:23.040 --> 29:28.880
 and just do symptoms. This was analyzed. You will miss about 20%, about 20% of people will

29:28.880 --> 29:32.960
 develop symptoms, or turn positive if you use the seven day test that option.

29:34.800 --> 29:36.880
 What about vaccinated people? Is there a day?

29:38.880 --> 29:42.480
 We're not we don't treat them any differently yet, just because we don't we don't know.

29:42.480 --> 29:45.600
 And it is tough. People are like, come on. I've been vaccinated. What am I doing?

29:45.600 --> 29:49.120
 Yeah, it's not about you. This is about transmission.

29:49.120 --> 29:51.040
 Okay. We just don't know, but we will. We will.

29:51.760 --> 29:56.160
 All right. A couple of email. Tarrin writes, hello, I work at a big academic

29:56.160 --> 30:03.520
 hospital. I'm almost 14 days post second Pfizer vaccine. Our hospital uses Abbott SARS-CoVIG assay.

30:03.520 --> 30:08.480
 A couple of my coworkers have gone to get tested, come back negative. The results specifically

30:08.480 --> 30:13.760
 state they can't be used for vaccine efficacy verification. What can be used for that? Anything?

30:16.960 --> 30:20.960
 So I've been telling people, just don't check your serologies. Just go ahead,

30:20.960 --> 30:25.040
 trust the data, trust the science, trust the protection. Yeah, there is a commercially

30:25.040 --> 30:31.440
 available neutralizing antibody assay. But again, I don't want to encourage you to do that. So yeah,

30:31.440 --> 30:36.400
 just go ahead, get your vaccine, stop doing all the blood work. Let's focus our resources on the

30:36.400 --> 30:42.560
 critical areas. All right. This is from Anthony. I do a live stream with Amy every Wednesday night,

30:42.560 --> 30:47.760
 and he heard it last night. And the topic came up of taking NSAIDs after vaccination to reduce

30:47.760 --> 30:52.800
 discomfort. If memory serves me correctly, someone even suggested taking it and over the

30:52.800 --> 30:58.320
 counter painkiller before vaccination, someone else thought NSAIDs reduced the effectiveness

30:58.320 --> 31:03.440
 of vaccination. What's the correct thing to do for years? I used aspirin to reduce pain so I

31:03.440 --> 31:07.440
 could exercise more than I read that this diminished the exercise effect.

31:10.480 --> 31:15.440
 Yeah, I get this question a lot, actually. And I'm thinking it might be like an anti-vaxxer thing.

31:16.160 --> 31:19.840
 If you feel crummy up to the vaccine, don't take anything. It won't work. They want everyone to

31:19.840 --> 31:27.360
 suffer a little bit more. You know, I got my second dose of vaccine on Tuesday morning.

31:27.920 --> 31:32.000
 And I had a few side effects, right? Like at one point, I opened an email from my partner

31:32.000 --> 31:36.320
 Nujali and I felt a little annoyed for a couple minutes. I'm sure it was the vaccine, not the

31:36.320 --> 31:40.560
 content of the email. And then I had a meeting yesterday. It was supposed to be at four. I thought

31:40.560 --> 31:45.600
 it was at three. So a little bit of a cognitive impact getting confused there. You know, and I

31:45.600 --> 31:50.160
 did. I felt a little achy, actually. I mean, you know, it wasn't big. I took a couple of leave.

31:50.160 --> 31:54.640
 I think that that's fine. I don't think there's any, you know, get Breanne Barker to jump in on this.

31:54.640 --> 31:59.200
 But you know, if you take a couple of leave, take a couple of ad bill, you take NSAIDs. I don't

31:59.200 --> 32:02.640
 think that that's going to prevent your B cells and T cells from doing their job. So

32:03.280 --> 32:09.360
 not a problem from my perspective. All right. One more from Karen, whose mother in November

32:09.360 --> 32:16.160
 contracted COVID-19. She's an assisted living facility, had a hard time, has a lot of comorbidities.

32:16.160 --> 32:20.800
 And at one point, she decided she didn't want to eat anymore, which they took it to determine

32:20.800 --> 32:26.880
 was her, her will not not to live. So they asked that she'd be placed in hospice care rather than

32:26.880 --> 32:32.800
 going to the hospital. So she would like to know a little discussion of hospice or palliative care

32:32.800 --> 32:39.200
 decisions in your clinical updates, Daniel. Sure. Sure. Actually, I appreciate that you bring

32:39.200 --> 32:44.000
 this up. We don't talk about this or a lot or haven't talked about this. But on a daily basis,

32:44.000 --> 32:51.440
 this is part of our our birthday. We try to get a sense of where people are headed, how they're

32:51.440 --> 32:55.760
 going to do. And there certainly are a lot of individuals where early on we realized that

32:55.760 --> 33:01.440
 that their chance of coming out of this in a positive way is low. And actually, you know,

33:01.440 --> 33:06.320
 sort of a little bit of a hats off to Northwell. They actually at Plainview Hospital, where I spend

33:06.320 --> 33:11.680
 a lot of time, they actually recruited and they have a full time palliative care specialist. And

33:11.680 --> 33:16.720
 she and I talk quite a bit just lovely, brilliant woman. I think she speaks more languages than I

33:16.720 --> 33:22.800
 have fingers. And we actually have specialists get involved, have conversations with the family.

33:22.800 --> 33:26.000
 You know, what are the goals of care? What would what would your loved one want?

33:26.800 --> 33:30.080
 Often, and it's wonderful when the loved one can be part of that decision making.

33:30.080 --> 33:36.640
 And yeah, so this is a big part. You really you really want to have this conversation before

33:36.640 --> 33:41.440
 someone gets sick. You want to share your your goals, your your desires with your family. I'm

33:41.440 --> 33:45.120
 started talking to the individuals who might end up getting COVID here, which is a lot of us

33:46.240 --> 33:50.960
 before so that when someone ends up in the hospital, you know, I actually worked with

33:50.960 --> 33:56.560
 intending who was a physicist and he used to refer to this as the fifth vital sign. You know,

33:56.560 --> 34:02.640
 you know, you want to know, you know, on the admission, what would this person want? What are

34:02.640 --> 34:08.320
 their goals of care? And often people who I consult for I will often put my recommendations in,

34:08.320 --> 34:12.320
 but then I'll also put a little tagline about, you know, these should be consistent with goals

34:12.320 --> 34:18.640
 of care. Particularly in the surge conditions, this would come up quite a bit. Does this individual

34:18.640 --> 34:24.000
 really want to be here in the hospital? Or is this an individual? Is this a family context where

34:24.000 --> 34:29.440
 they would prefer to be home? They'd prefer to be in a hospice setting? And I will say, my

34:29.440 --> 34:35.120
 stepsister is a hospice nurse. Hospice is not, ooh, someone's just about to die. It is a it is a

34:35.120 --> 34:40.080
 change in the goals of care. And a lot of times, just to qualify a hospice, you're saying, I think

34:40.080 --> 34:45.440
 they're less likely to live six months. So the mistake people often make when they think about

34:45.440 --> 34:50.480
 palliative care is they wait too long to make these decisions. They wait too long to have these

34:50.480 --> 34:54.960
 conversations. And I appreciate you bringing it up because I think this is critical. This is

34:54.960 --> 34:59.200
 no one wants to talk about this, but everyone should talk about it so that when we get to this

34:59.200 --> 35:07.680
 point, we know what you really want us to be doing. That's COVID-19 clinical update number 46 with

35:07.680 --> 35:21.840
 Dr. Daniel Griffin. Thank you, Daniel. Oh, thank you so much, Vincent. And everyone, be safe.
