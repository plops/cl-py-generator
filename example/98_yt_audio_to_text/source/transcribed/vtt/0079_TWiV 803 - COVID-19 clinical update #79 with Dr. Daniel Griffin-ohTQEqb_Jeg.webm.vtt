 This week in virology, the podcast about viruses, the kind that make you sick.

00:10.240 --> 00:21.120
 From MicrobeTV, this is Twiv. This week in virology, episode 803 recorded on September 9th, 2021.

00:21.120 --> 00:26.800
 I'm Vincent Dracken-Yellow, and you're listening to the podcast all about viruses. Joining me

00:26.800 --> 00:32.960
 today from New York, Daniel Griffin. Hello, everyone. How's the week been, Daniel?

00:34.160 --> 00:40.640
 You know, it's a little truncated. Here in New York, we had a long weekend. I guess, well,

00:40.640 --> 00:46.640
 most of the country had a long weekend. It was Labor Day, right? Monday was Labor Day,

00:46.640 --> 00:52.640
 and I celebrated Labor Day by not laboring. I'll let other people labor. So it's nice to

00:52.640 --> 00:57.760
 have a little. I did a lot of sailing, so that was very nice. Time with the family. All right,

00:57.760 --> 01:03.520
 but we got lots to cover of. I keep looking to that point when we have less to cover. We're not

01:03.520 --> 01:12.400
 there yet. So let me start with my quotation. Life is a long lesson in humility, and that's by James

01:12.400 --> 01:20.880
 M. Barrie. I think Peter Pan maybe was something that he created, so. But it seemed appropriate,

01:20.880 --> 01:27.120
 because I think science is clearly an arena where this is very much true. And I think it's fair to

01:27.120 --> 01:32.960
 say science is a lifelong lesson in humility. That's why we do science because we don't know the

01:32.960 --> 01:39.600
 answers. So science is really, I like to say, a journey of discovery, not a path to confirmation.

01:40.160 --> 01:43.520
 If we know all the answers, we would not have to do the experiments or the trials.

01:43.520 --> 01:52.640
 This episode is going to drop on 9-11, so I just want to just sort of take a moment there.

01:52.640 --> 02:01.280
 You know, I grew up in New York, so that was really sort of a difficult day for a lot of us.

02:03.840 --> 02:11.840
 All right, let's get into a number of papers here. The quotation I start with

02:11.840 --> 02:18.080
 really is something that has been addressed. I've seen a number of papers recently,

02:18.640 --> 02:23.120
 and one of them, actually a couple of them, I think are in open forum infectious diseases.

02:23.840 --> 02:30.080
 And the first overlooked shortcomings of observational studies of interventions in

02:30.080 --> 02:36.640
 coronavirus disease 2019, an illustrated review for the clinician, right? And so, you know,

02:36.640 --> 02:41.600
 these updates, I don't know if our listeners remember, they really started off theoretically

02:41.600 --> 02:47.200
 as a clinician update. So I like to keep that focus, but I think we have non-clinicians that

02:47.200 --> 02:53.680
 listen, right? But let me just read the abstract here, because over the last two years, this has

02:53.680 --> 02:59.360
 been a rapid education, re-education for a lot of clinicians when something gets published.

03:00.800 --> 03:04.560
 It gets thrown out there as a pre-print, it gets interpreted in the media,

03:04.560 --> 03:11.920
 and a lot of clinicians are trying to decide what to do based, unfortunately, on a lot of

03:11.920 --> 03:18.560
 observational studies that may not have been done that well. So let me just read the abstract here.

03:18.560 --> 03:24.560
 The rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome, coronavirus, to infection across the globe,

03:24.560 --> 03:30.560
 triggered an unprecedented increase in research activities that resulted in an astronomical

03:30.560 --> 03:37.520
 publication output of observational studies. However, most studies fail to apply fully the

03:37.520 --> 03:43.920
 necessary methodological techniques that systematically deal with different biases and confounding,

03:43.920 --> 03:49.120
 which not only limits their scientific merit, but may result in harm through misleading

03:49.120 --> 03:55.840
 information. And, you know, I am going to highly recommend that all clinicians take the time to

03:55.840 --> 04:03.440
 read this. I think this is really critical. And it's only an eight-page paper. It's not

04:03.440 --> 04:10.560
 terrible to read. You know, our goal is discovering what's true as clinicians. You know, when you go

04:10.560 --> 04:14.880
 see the clinician, you want them to tell you what's true, not just what they're excited about.

04:15.520 --> 04:20.240
 And, unfortunately, as we've seen over the last two years, there's been a lot of poorly

04:20.240 --> 04:26.800
 done studies that actually got people excited about stuff that turned out not to make a difference,

04:26.800 --> 04:33.840
 right? And they talk in this paper about several of these issues. So one, treatment selection bias.

04:34.400 --> 04:39.840
 Maybe we remember that vitamin D study that we all got excited about. And then some savvy people

04:39.840 --> 04:44.640
 in Spain realized that they were giving vitamin D to the people in the healthier, less acute wards,

04:44.640 --> 04:50.560
 but not giving it to people with severe disease and more issues. And so, yeah, young, healthy people

04:50.560 --> 04:56.960
 do better. So was it really the vitamin D? And that was not helpful if anything that was misleading.

04:57.840 --> 05:02.800
 Then there's survivor bias, right? You know, you decide you're going to enroll someone in a

05:02.800 --> 05:08.240
 treatment. And they have to live long enough to get the treatment. So there's sort of this immortal

05:08.240 --> 05:14.000
 period introduced. So it's important that we understand that. And then there's these competing

05:14.000 --> 05:19.440
 risks, like if our endpoint is discharged from the hospital, what happens afterwards have we

05:19.440 --> 05:26.000
 excluded them, not follow them into discharge. So there's really, I think this is really great.

05:26.000 --> 05:31.840
 There is a role for observational studies, but this paper just reinforces how important it is

05:31.840 --> 05:37.040
 designing, conducting, and then really, I'm going to say the integrity of publishing

05:37.040 --> 05:43.280
 helpful, reliable information. Because if you get something out there, and it supports something

05:43.280 --> 05:47.840
 because of one of these biases or poor study design, that's not helpful. It's more than not

05:47.840 --> 05:53.040
 helpful. It's actually can be harmful. The other paper that I enjoyed this last week,

05:54.160 --> 06:00.080
 got all this extra time, right? So I could read critical review of the scientific evidence and

06:00.080 --> 06:07.840
 recommendations in COVID-19 management guidelines. This is really enlightening. I get to see some

06:07.840 --> 06:14.000
 of this as I'm involved in the care of patients at multiple health systems, also involved in the

06:14.000 --> 06:20.080
 outpatient setting. And I talked to our providers across the tri-state area. Well, I tend to look

06:20.080 --> 06:27.040
 to professional societies or government resources like the IDSA, the NIH, American Society Hematology,

06:27.040 --> 06:33.440
 or the CDC. This paper gives a good description of the landscape. There are actually hundreds of

06:33.440 --> 06:38.800
 different recommendations out there. Only about half of the ones out there really have any assessment

06:38.800 --> 06:44.720
 of the supporting evidence. And there's actually quite a bit of discrepancies between different

06:44.720 --> 06:51.600
 guidelines. And I actually think this speaks to this vacuum created by a lack of well-designed

06:51.600 --> 06:58.240
 randomized controlled trials. It also might speak to an issue with who creates these guidelines,

06:58.240 --> 07:05.040
 right? Each hospital health care system physician group out there creating their own treatment

07:05.040 --> 07:10.800
 guidelines in this void. I mean, I might, like for instance, there are guidelines for treatment

07:10.800 --> 07:15.440
 at Columbia University, or recommended by a professional society. But then I go to a certain

07:15.440 --> 07:23.600
 hospital, oh, we don't do that here. So this is a challenge, and I think this is another area.

07:23.600 --> 07:30.880
 But I shouldn't complain, right? I have colleagues in rural parts of the American West, and they're

07:30.880 --> 07:35.760
 probably listening and saying, Dr. Griffin, you don't need to complain, we have it worse.

07:36.320 --> 07:41.680
 And I won't even go into the details. You can just use your imagination, but you can imagine some

07:41.680 --> 07:47.680
 of the guidelines in certain areas of the world and our country. All right, let's get right into

07:47.680 --> 07:55.040
 children, COVID and mental health. As I've been saying for quite a while, children are at lower

07:55.040 --> 08:01.600
 risk, but they are not at no risk. And I think everyone is really waking up to this. Wearing a

08:01.600 --> 08:06.080
 mask is less dramatic for a child than being hospitalized. And I'm going to add a new one.

08:06.080 --> 08:11.680
 Children should not have to choose between health and education. So I've talked a lot about the

08:11.680 --> 08:20.080
 American Academy of Pediatrics, which has a COVID tracking. The CDC also has a data tracking page,

08:20.080 --> 08:26.320
 specifically looking at pediatric data. So you can look at this, and it's just it's outstanding.

08:26.320 --> 08:31.680
 We're over over a quarter million children were infected with COVID in the last week.

08:32.240 --> 08:38.960
 Hospitalizations are going up. Just anyone who is still sort of in this idea that for children,

08:38.960 --> 08:45.440
 COVID is not a problem. The heads in the sand, the information is out there. Yes, two years ago,

08:45.440 --> 08:50.720
 18 months ago, when our I was give moms the credit, and I think I should in most cases,

08:50.720 --> 08:55.520
 when the moms were keeping the kids safe, despite what people were saying, if a kid does not get

08:55.520 --> 09:01.600
 exposed to COVID-19, if they don't get infected with COVID-19, it's not a problem. But now children,

09:02.400 --> 09:06.240
 enormous number of children, I think we're over 6 million children have been infected with COVID

09:06.240 --> 09:15.120
 in this country. So we did get some data from the post MMWR, two really informative publications,

09:15.760 --> 09:22.160
 trends in COVID-19 cases, emergency department visits, and hospital admissions among children

09:22.160 --> 09:31.040
 and adolescents aged 0 to 17 years. This is United States August 2020 to August 2021.

09:31.040 --> 09:40.480
 And so here the CDC analyzed COVID-19 cases, ED visits with a COVID-19 diagnosis, hospital admissions,

09:41.600 --> 09:48.480
 and overall COVID-19 ED visits and hospital admissions increased since June 2021 in children

09:48.480 --> 09:56.320
 and adolescents. The rate per 100,000 persons of COVID-19 admissions in August 2021 in the

09:56.320 --> 10:01.520
 quartile of states with the lowest vaccination rate was almost four times higher than the quartile

10:01.520 --> 10:06.960
 with the highest vaccination coverage, right? Think about, most of these kids are not eligible,

10:06.960 --> 10:13.360
 so a lot of the impact here we're seeing is adults getting vaccinated and the benefit that

10:13.360 --> 10:20.800
 can provide. We also saw second publication hospitalizations associated with COVID-19 among

10:20.800 --> 10:30.400
 children and adolescents. COVID-19 states March 1, 2020 to August 14, 2021. Here they reported

10:30.400 --> 10:37.440
 that the weekly COVID-19 associated hospitalization rates among children and adolescents rose nearly

10:37.440 --> 10:45.520
 five-fold during late June to mid-August 2021. The proportions of hospitalized children and

10:45.520 --> 10:52.720
 adolescents with severe disease was similar before. And during this period of Delta predominance,

10:54.560 --> 10:59.840
 hospitalization rates were 10 times higher among the unvaccinated than among the fully

10:59.840 --> 11:05.680
 adolescent, fully vaccinated adolescents. So that's looking at the vaccine eligible group.

11:06.640 --> 11:11.360
 So I think just important information that we have here, it's great that this is being tracked.

11:11.360 --> 11:16.720
 This is important when parents are making decisions, when adolescents are involved in

11:16.720 --> 11:23.920
 shared decision-making about vaccines. Yeah, I'm not sure why people are so sensitive.

11:23.920 --> 11:29.760
 Whenever I talk about children and COVID, I'm just sharing the information. So pre-exposure

11:29.760 --> 11:36.640
 period transmission testing never miss an opportunity to test. I just did a keynote talk earlier today

11:36.640 --> 11:43.840
 about testing. And usually this is the area where I'm trying to reinforce antigen testing,

11:44.720 --> 11:52.480
 talking about PCR detection, talking about how actually antigen tests maybe have been compared

11:52.480 --> 11:59.120
 against the wrong gold standard. Maybe if you compare those antigen tests against viral culture,

11:59.120 --> 12:06.080
 against contact tracing, against transmission. I think I'm going to say that antigen tests used

12:06.080 --> 12:10.960
 during that two days before, three to five days after symptom, during the period of time we see

12:10.960 --> 12:18.800
 transmission, even at home antigen tests were in the high 90s. So they are not an issue with lack

12:18.800 --> 12:25.280
 of sensitivity during that period. Once a person is past that period stage, once the viral RNA is low

12:25.280 --> 12:29.520
 and the viral antigen gets to a very low level, yes, the antigen test will turn negative,

12:30.160 --> 12:34.800
 use the right test at the right time to ask the right question. But today I'm going to talk

12:34.800 --> 12:42.320
 about serology. We had a couple interesting studies looking at serology. It's going to be

12:42.320 --> 12:49.680
 serology positivity. One is the U.S., the other Kenya, both published in JAMA. So the first one

12:50.240 --> 12:56.960
 estimated U.S. infection and vaccine-induced SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence based on blood donations

12:56.960 --> 13:08.320
 July 2020 to May 2021. So this is a repeated cross-sectional study that included 1,443,519

13:08.320 --> 13:15.200
 blood donation specimens from a catchment area representing 74% of the U.S. population.

13:16.320 --> 13:23.360
 They reported that general population increased. This is really what's sort of the money here.

13:23.360 --> 13:30.640
 83.3% had a combined infection or vaccine-induced antibodies. It's actually pretty high, I have to

13:30.640 --> 13:36.800
 say. The authors looked at both spike and nucleocapsid antibodies, nucleocapsid being associated

13:36.800 --> 13:42.880
 with infection, spike being from either. This is a very high number. I think there's a couple

13:42.880 --> 13:48.640
 things to point out. People that donate blood are not necessarily representative of everyone.

13:48.640 --> 13:53.600
 But there was, I'll say, a little bit of a disturbing feature here. If you looked at this,

13:54.320 --> 13:59.440
 the infection-induced seroprevalence was consistently highest in Hispanic,

14:00.320 --> 14:05.920
 non-Hispanic Black individuals. The Caucasians are getting their immunity from vaccination.

14:06.640 --> 14:10.160
 Other populations are getting it disproportionately from infection.

14:10.160 --> 14:19.840
 Now, the second article, so here, most people in this first study are getting their positivity,

14:19.840 --> 14:25.280
 their immunity from vaccination. I think we're up to 75% of the U.S. population has gotten the

14:25.280 --> 14:31.520
 first dose. 75% of eligible. Remember, we still have a large chunk of our population, the children

14:31.520 --> 14:38.000
 that are not eligible. The second article was a situation where there was limited access to

14:38.000 --> 14:43.920
 vaccines. And this was prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies from a national sero surveillance

14:43.920 --> 14:51.520
 of Kenyan blood donors, January through March 2021. And in this article, the authors report

14:51.520 --> 14:58.080
 about seroprevolence in Kenya. This is a surveillance study looking at blood donors,

14:58.080 --> 15:04.880
 aged 16 to 64, slightly different age demographic in Kenya. We don't have as many folks over the

15:04.880 --> 15:13.680
 age of 65. The national prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was estimated at various points in time,

15:14.720 --> 15:21.920
 basically getting to sort of the end, the crude seroprevalence had gotten to as high as 44.2.

15:22.640 --> 15:27.120
 And this is actually in line with what we're seeing in a lot of other areas. But remember,

15:27.120 --> 15:36.080
 this is dominantly coming from exposure from infection. The Kenya COVID-19 vaccine program

15:36.720 --> 15:43.040
 only began in March of 2021. So a little bit, and there were only up to 2% of the population

15:43.040 --> 15:53.360
 by July 2021. So most of that is from infection. All right, active vaccination. There's always

15:53.360 --> 15:59.680
 news on this front. Never miss an opportunity to vaccinate vaccination is how this pandemic ends.

16:00.400 --> 16:05.840
 Wednesday, September 1st, right, Madhiran announced its completed submission for full approval

16:05.840 --> 16:12.480
 of its mRNA vaccine. So we're hoping we're going to see that coming up on the horizon.

16:12.480 --> 16:18.080
 Why does this matter, right? It actually seems like it does when I talk to my patients. I was

16:18.080 --> 16:25.680
 talking to an unvaccinated woman earlier this week. And she was not vaccinated. And she said

16:25.680 --> 16:31.120
 she was not interested in getting vaccinated until she heard about this new licensed vaccine called

16:31.120 --> 16:36.320
 comarinate. And she's very excited to get comarinate as soon as that is available.

16:37.360 --> 16:42.240
 So I think once we have the ability for people to get spike-vax,

16:42.240 --> 16:47.280
 I was talking to one of the nurses today and asked, you know, what would you choose the comarinity

16:47.280 --> 16:56.400
 or the spike-vax? I choose Spike Lee. Okay. So I think this stuff matters, actually. People seem

16:56.400 --> 17:01.840
 to care. And the other thing, right? I mean, I was not going to include, how can you not talk

17:01.840 --> 17:07.760
 about boosters? That's all anyone wants to talk about. So what about the data from Israel to

17:07.760 --> 17:14.720
 boosters? So this is my plug for Shane Crotty. I listened to the Shane Crotty episode. Shane

17:14.720 --> 17:18.960
 Crotty is actually one of the people that I reach out to when I've got an immunology question.

17:19.600 --> 17:25.760
 He's brilliant. He's actually an individual, the WHO, and a lot of other people turn to when they

17:25.760 --> 17:31.200
 really want to know what the science shows. And if you go to the Twiv episode right before this,

17:32.560 --> 17:37.600
 it's great because everyone's asking him questions. And Shane Crotty is so good. He basically

17:37.600 --> 17:42.800
 this is what the science says. He doesn't get ahead of the science. You don't get Shane Crotty's

17:42.800 --> 17:48.960
 opinion. You get this is what the science is telling us. So if people really want a deep dive,

17:48.960 --> 17:53.680
 you know, spend that. I think he's on for about the first hour, but then stay for the rest of the

17:53.680 --> 17:59.200
 show. But that that is really great. But what what created all this fuss? And I'm just going to spend

17:59.200 --> 18:06.320
 a moment on this. The preprint correlation of SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infections to time from

18:06.320 --> 18:14.160
 vaccine preliminary study was put up as a preprint. Now, a number of statisticians, mathematicians

18:14.160 --> 18:19.680
 have got a chance to really look at this. And some of the other data you can bring down from the

18:19.680 --> 18:26.320
 Israeli dashboards of public accessible data. And yesterday, I got to listen to a really great

18:26.320 --> 18:31.600
 analysis of this data presented by one of my colleagues, Ephraim Castillo. He's one of the

18:31.600 --> 18:38.960
 senior VPs at Optum with whom I work. And he really explained all about how this data was not

18:38.960 --> 18:44.640
 originally correctly analyzed, explained a bit about Simpson's paradox, where if you don't break

18:44.640 --> 18:50.720
 it down and look at the data correctly, it can be concerning. But he went ahead and broke down

18:51.680 --> 18:59.040
 the data by a number of narrower age bands. And really looked at, okay, if you look at a place

18:59.040 --> 19:06.240
 like Israel, if you look at the population, say 90+, over 90% are vaccinated. Actually,

19:06.240 --> 19:11.520
 over 70, if you look at people over the age of 70, really, if you go to people 60 and up,

19:11.520 --> 19:16.720
 the majority over 90% are vaccinated, right? These people, you've greatly reduced their risk,

19:16.720 --> 19:21.360
 but they're still the high risk of ending. And if you go through each, what is the efficacy we're

19:21.360 --> 19:29.040
 seeing for prevention of severe disease, you're seeing in the oldest population an 82-fold reduction

19:29.040 --> 19:35.920
 in risk in efficacy versus severe disease of over 90%. And you sort of march all the way down. You

19:35.920 --> 19:41.280
 actually get to the youngest individuals under 30, and you're looking at close to 100% in the 30

19:41.280 --> 19:48.160
 to 39, 96.8%. So properly analyzed, I continue to not be concerned by this data.

19:48.160 --> 19:53.680
 Shane Crotty talked a little bit about, you know, are we concerned about infection?

19:54.400 --> 19:58.880
 Is there a potential that that's going to be tied in with transmission potential for long

19:58.880 --> 20:04.640
 COVID? We'll have to see. But I think this is just when you look at it correctly, there's no reason

20:04.640 --> 20:10.960
 for panic. The booster study, the booster decisions will be addressed, but you don't need to run out.

20:10.960 --> 20:15.920
 I get questions every day. Should I run out? If we're going to follow the science, the science

20:15.920 --> 20:23.840
 is not pushing us. All right, passive vaccination. I'm almost delighted how much my colleagues have

20:23.840 --> 20:29.920
 taken advantage of the prophylactic indication for monoclonals. So let me just reinforce this here.

20:30.720 --> 20:40.640
 So a bit back, the Regeneron cocktail, Regeneron Cove, was given an expansion of its EUA for post

20:40.640 --> 20:49.520
 exposure prophylaxis. So the US FDA issued an EUA of all these three letter acronyms, TLA's,

20:49.520 --> 20:57.760
 to permit the emergency use of Regeneron Cove for post exposure prophylaxis in individuals

20:57.760 --> 21:03.760
 who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19. And who are these individuals? So one,

21:03.760 --> 21:10.080
 not fully vaccinated, or they were vaccinated, but you have doubts about their ability to

21:10.080 --> 21:16.400
 mount an adequate immune response, an individual who is on immunosuppressive medications,

21:18.320 --> 21:24.000
 or, as they say, at high risk of exposure to an individual infected because of occurrence in a,

21:24.000 --> 21:30.000
 let's say, a nursing home or an institutional setting such as a prison. So I've actually added

21:31.200 --> 21:37.600
 this as part of my history of present illness. Once I get through with the patient, I say,

21:37.600 --> 21:42.080
 all right, this is great. Now we have a plan for what we're going to do for you, but let's talk

21:42.080 --> 21:46.960
 about everyone else that you may have exposed who is either exposed and might benefit for

21:46.960 --> 21:53.680
 prophylaxis or is already infected and might benefit from early treatment. You know, I have to say

21:53.680 --> 22:01.040
 this has really been tremendous in the tri-state area. We are seeing a low number of our pro-health

22:01.040 --> 22:07.600
 and our optometri-state folks end up in the hospital because we are doing, I say, a tremendous amount

22:07.600 --> 22:13.600
 of getting these individuals in for the monoclonals, keeping them out of the hospital. And a lot of

22:13.600 --> 22:21.280
 the health systems have really helped support access, you know, tip my hat again to the Catholic

22:21.280 --> 22:27.200
 hospitals, really jumped in and helped us with this. All right, I'm going to jump right to the

22:27.200 --> 22:34.320
 early inflammatory phase, right? So we did have an update, an update from the American Society of

22:34.320 --> 22:40.160
 Hematology, living guidelines on the use of anticoagulation for thrombo-prophylaxis

22:40.160 --> 22:47.760
 in patients with COVID-19. And this was an update on the use of anticoagulation in critically ill

22:47.760 --> 22:54.400
 patients. Full disclosure, I'm one of the authors on this. But this was a recommendation

22:54.400 --> 23:02.560
 regarding patients in the hospital who are requiring critical care. So these are either patients in

23:02.560 --> 23:09.280
 ICU, but it's not geographic. So it's patients who require that level of support, really in favor

23:09.280 --> 23:17.280
 of prophylactic intensity anticoagulation here. So this is that issue that a patient in the ICU,

23:17.840 --> 23:23.120
 though at increased risk of clotting from COVID-19. And we know that COVID-19 patients have an

23:23.120 --> 23:29.680
 increased risk. We felt reviewing the available literature that the risk of bleeding and associated

23:29.680 --> 23:37.840
 mortality was in favor of prophylactic intensity in that setting. So what's sort of the standard

23:37.840 --> 23:41.600
 right here? A patient ends up in the hospital, right? They're usually there because they're

23:41.600 --> 23:49.280
 hypoxic. The rubair oxygen level is below 94%. Somehow they've either not been vaccinated,

23:49.280 --> 23:54.640
 where they've missed the monoclonals or that small percent of people that progress. The

23:54.640 --> 24:01.840
 standard is to start anticoagulation. Here's a little more guidance on dosing. The remdesivir,

24:01.840 --> 24:07.200
 the dexamethasone. But what if they progress, right? We've talked about patients that are

24:07.200 --> 24:14.160
 requiring more oxygen support. We've talked about tosyllizumab in the past. But what if there's a

24:14.160 --> 24:19.680
 shortage of tosyllizumab as we're seeing in many parts of the country? Are there other options?

24:19.680 --> 24:24.400
 Well, there is another option that is in the guidelines, but let's talk about a publication

24:24.400 --> 24:30.240
 in the Lancet that just came out. This was in the Lancet Respiratory Medicine, efficacy and

24:30.240 --> 24:36.800
 safety of barisatinib for the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. This is the

24:36.800 --> 24:44.880
 cold barrier study. This was a randomized double-blind parallel group placebo-controlled phase 3 trial.

24:46.400 --> 24:52.800
 So this is, as I like to say, the much-awaited results of the cold barrier study. So as, you know,

24:52.800 --> 24:58.640
 really in the title, this was a phase 3 double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial.

24:58.640 --> 25:05.440
 Participants were enrolled from 101 centers across 12 countries in Asia, Europe, North America,

25:05.440 --> 25:10.400
 South America. Hospitalized adults with COVID-19 received standard of care,

25:11.520 --> 25:19.360
 were randomized one-to-one to either receive once daily barisatinib for milligrams or matched

25:19.360 --> 25:26.800
 placebo for up to 14 days. The standard of care included corticosteroids such as dexamethasone,

25:26.800 --> 25:33.120
 antivirals, remdesivir. They reported the 28-day, all-cause mortality was 8%

25:33.120 --> 25:42.160
 for the 62 folks in the barisatinib and 13% for the 100 in the placebo group,

25:42.160 --> 25:49.680
 reporting a 38.2% relative reduction in mortality. There's a one additional death was prevented

25:49.680 --> 25:57.200
 per 20 treated, so a 20 number needed to treat to prevent one death. The 60-day, all-cause mortality

25:57.200 --> 26:05.280
 was 10% for barisatinib, 15% for placebo. The frequencies of serious adverse events were similar

26:05.280 --> 26:14.880
 between the two groups. So what is this drug, Dr. Griffin? Barisatinib is a Janus kinase

26:14.880 --> 26:20.720
 inhibitor. It interferes with the jack stat signaling pathway, and the thought is this is

26:20.720 --> 26:28.640
 actually reducing cytokine, particularly IL-6 production. Thus, the idea we were concerned,

26:29.040 --> 26:34.960
 using tosyllizumab and IL-6 receptor blocker without steroids because the IL-6 levels would

26:34.960 --> 26:41.280
 shoot up. Here, you're using this agent that actually reduces IL-6 production. In some other

26:41.280 --> 26:47.760
 studies, if you're unable to use steroids, this is still something that you could potentially use.

26:47.760 --> 26:53.120
 And actually, I'll say this is something that the IDSA has in their recommendations,

26:53.120 --> 26:57.600
 where they're saying, among hospitalized patients who are progressing, elevated

26:57.600 --> 27:02.800
 inflammatory markers, this is something you can consider, and also something you can consider

27:02.800 --> 27:10.800
 in a patient for whom steroids cannot be given for whatever reason. Long COVID, and I think it's

27:10.800 --> 27:17.440
 become really clear, but I'm going to add this to my list of pithy quotations. COVID is not just a

27:17.440 --> 27:21.600
 two-week viral illness for many people. I'm going to know early on, we had a lot of people

27:21.600 --> 27:26.000
 saying, you know, with COVID, either live or you die, you know, in this perception that it was two

27:26.000 --> 27:33.840
 weeks. But in the MMWR, the article, long-term symptoms among adults tested for SARS-CoV-2,

27:33.840 --> 27:40.480
 United States January 2020 to April 2021. This is hot off the press today, as we're recording.

27:41.200 --> 27:48.560
 And in this report, the authors administered a nationwide internet survey to 698 U.S. adults,

27:48.560 --> 27:55.920
 aged greater or equal to 18 years of age with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. And they compared them

27:55.920 --> 28:04.160
 to 2,437 with a negative test. 2,750 had never been tested. And they reported for those with a

28:04.160 --> 28:12.960
 positive test, 65.9% had symptoms persisting for greater than four weeks. Now, the usual suspects,

28:13.520 --> 28:19.200
 fatigue, change in smell or taste, shortness of breath, cough, headache. But I'll say the same

28:19.200 --> 28:23.520
 challenges that we talked about previously in the adolescent study. There's a lot of background.

28:23.520 --> 28:28.320
 Now, we're seeing this above background. But a lot of challenges in sorting that out.

28:28.320 --> 28:34.160
 But I will say, this is another point in the line, you know, that long COVID is a real thing.

28:34.160 --> 28:41.040
 And a significant percent of people are not just better after two weeks. Now, there was also a

28:41.040 --> 28:48.400
 preprint posted severe COVID-19 is associated with sustained biochemical disturbances and

28:48.400 --> 28:54.880
 prolonged symptomatology, a retrospective, retrospective single center cohort study.

28:55.600 --> 28:59.520
 This is a paper that's up as a preprint, but it's submitted to the Journal of Critical

28:59.520 --> 29:04.400
 Medicine. So it'll go through peer review. I'm one of the authors, right? So it's not

29:04.400 --> 29:12.240
 talking a couple of my publications this time or preprint postings. And this really describes a

29:12.240 --> 29:20.400
 cohort of 168 patients with severe COVID-19 previously hospitalized and describes how in this cohort

29:21.200 --> 29:25.680
 they have sustained biochemical disturbances, elevated ferritin,

29:25.680 --> 29:32.880
 de-dimer, elevated neutrophil lymphocyte ratio. So it's nice to start having some objective data.

29:33.440 --> 29:39.840
 There's been a lot of ideas about what drives long COVID discussion about viral persistence,

29:39.840 --> 29:45.440
 continued antigenic stimuli. There's always been a lot of thought that this is something with the

29:45.440 --> 29:50.800
 immune system. So it's just nice to have some objective, maybe some breadcrumbs here to start

29:50.800 --> 29:56.080
 to understand and hopefully be able to help these individuals. What about low and middle

29:56.080 --> 30:01.520
 income countries and COVID? No one is safe until everyone is safe. I've been having this discussion

30:01.520 --> 30:07.760
 quite a bit that it is the right thing to do. It is the selfish thing to do to immunize the world.

30:07.760 --> 30:14.720
 Where are all these variants coming from that's keeping everyone awake at night? And we heard from

30:14.720 --> 30:21.280
 the White House COVID advisor, Jeffrey Zietz, that the US plans to invest $3 billion in the

30:21.280 --> 30:26.640
 vaccine supply chain as it continues to work to position itself as a leading supplier of vaccines

30:26.640 --> 30:33.600
 for the world. I heard some interesting musings by Anthony Fauci about maybe using the PEPFAR network

30:33.600 --> 30:40.240
 to help with vaccines. But then we just heard that COVAX, a global program to distribute COVID-19

30:40.240 --> 30:48.000
 vaccines, cut its 2021 forecast for available doses by one quarter. And there was what I thought

30:48.000 --> 30:54.640
 was an interesting disturbing New York Times article by Benjamin Mueller and Daniel E. Slotnick.

30:55.360 --> 31:01.920
 Let me quote, in its latest projection, the global immunization program known as COVAX

31:01.920 --> 31:08.640
 said that it expected to have a total of only, I'm throwing in only 1.4 billion doses available by

31:08.640 --> 31:16.000
 the end of 2021. In June, the program had said that it expected to have access to 1.9 billion doses

31:16.000 --> 31:22.560
 this year. Experts have said 11 billion doses are needed to slow the spread of the virus.

31:23.200 --> 31:30.560
 So just to give people perspective, as of now, less than half of a percent of all the doses

31:30.560 --> 31:38.800
 have been administered in low income countries. So this is not great. So and maybe with that,

31:38.800 --> 31:43.760
 I will just go into a reminder. During the months of August, September and October,

31:44.320 --> 31:50.080
 please go to parasiteswithoutboarders.com, go to donate. We are going to continue to support

31:50.080 --> 31:57.600
 floating doctors who are grouped down in Panama. And as we discussed last week,

31:57.600 --> 32:00.960
 they're going to be working with the Ministry. They're going to be getting vaccines out there

32:01.920 --> 32:09.360
 really help us because COVID, the COVID pandemic is a global pandemic. And if we don't treat it as

32:09.360 --> 32:15.840
 such, we're all at risk. Time for some email questions for Daniel. You can send yours to Daniel

32:15.840 --> 32:24.080
 at microbe.tv. John writes, I'm 71. Due to colon cancer, I've lost my spleen, pancreas, half of

32:24.080 --> 32:29.920
 one lung and a couple of feet of colon. My health is not great, but my diabetes and blood pressure

32:29.920 --> 32:36.240
 are well controlled. I received my second dose of Moderna vaccine in February. Is there a test that

32:36.240 --> 32:41.200
 I can request that will show the condition of my immune system? As of now, I don't feel at all

32:41.200 --> 32:46.800
 convinced that the vaccine has or will work for me as well as intended. The third dose is available

32:46.800 --> 32:52.240
 or soon will be. I will get one if only for additional protection against infection. And yes,

32:52.240 --> 32:58.160
 I do understand the difference between infection and disease. I really don't want the infection.

32:58.160 --> 33:02.880
 I'm fairly certain that the disease would knock me off my perch. I would really appreciate any

33:02.880 --> 33:07.760
 information on available tests that would help me to understand my position. Okay.

33:09.520 --> 33:14.880
 So good, good. And I appreciate that you added the sophistication at the end because I think

33:14.880 --> 33:21.280
 that sophistication is required. We do not have any great tests for telling how well does the

33:21.280 --> 33:29.120
 vaccine work against preventing disease, right, ending up in the hospital death. There is, I'll say

33:29.120 --> 33:35.600
 some information supporting the idea that there's a certain correlate between antibody levels and

33:35.600 --> 33:42.640
 infection. But I'm going to say that sort of with trepidation, you know, that this is growing,

33:42.640 --> 33:49.200
 we're learning about this, you know, I'm going to leave it sort of there. We do not have that

33:49.200 --> 33:53.200
 test, I think that you want, you want to go ahead and have a test and have that security.

33:53.200 --> 33:58.480
 There's certain ideas that certain levels of antibodies above a certain threshold might be

33:58.480 --> 34:03.360
 associated with a lower risk of infection. What am I going to advise you to do? So, you know,

34:03.360 --> 34:07.200
 you would probably be an individual as you describe who would qualify for that third shot.

34:08.160 --> 34:12.000
 We do not know exactly what that results in, right? We're still waiting for the science as

34:12.000 --> 34:15.840
 far as efficacy because you don't want to know what happens to my antibodies. You want to know

34:15.840 --> 34:21.600
 what happens to my risk of infection, what happens to my risk of disease. The second thing, you want

34:21.600 --> 34:29.120
 to continue to act cautiously. You do not want to have a run-in until we have antivirals, until we

34:29.120 --> 34:35.120
 have some other things that are that we can offer. And I mean effective antivirals, not remdesivir,

34:35.120 --> 34:39.840
 hopefully a product by Merck or Pfizer that comes out in the next couple months. So continue to

34:39.840 --> 34:45.600
 wear masks, continue to make smart decisions. Hopefully individuals like you will have more to offer.

34:46.880 --> 34:51.760
 Debbie writes, I'm an internist who has been educating the physicians in our medium-sized

34:51.760 --> 34:56.960
 primary care practice since the beginning of the pandemic. As I look to the future of this

34:56.960 --> 35:01.680
 virus becoming endemic, I'm trying to think how to frame this and what measures to follow.

35:01.680 --> 35:07.840
 It occurs to me that hospital strain, and that's not strain of virus, by the way. That's strain on

35:07.840 --> 35:13.840
 the hospital is one of the most important things to follow. In my home state of Texas, our non-medical

35:13.840 --> 35:20.720
 governor has decided 15% of beds being occupied by COVID patients was a measure of distress.

35:20.720 --> 35:24.080
 I can follow this number on the Johns Hopkins website from my state.

35:24.080 --> 35:28.000
 Locally, it's harder to follow. It seems that hospital strain numbers are not universally

35:28.000 --> 35:33.600
 agreed upon and also seem to change. Hospitals are used to growing capacity during surges and

35:33.600 --> 35:39.200
 emergencies. Is there any agreed upon and standardized measure of hospital strain,

35:39.200 --> 35:45.600
 and if so, any reliable website for looking at it? I'm also following the percent positive rate

35:46.480 --> 35:51.040
 only as an indication of adequacy of testing and then looking at cases per 100,000

35:51.040 --> 35:59.040
 per seven days on the CDC website or globalepidemics.org. Additionally, home testing or very easily

35:59.040 --> 36:04.000
 accessible testing is going to have to be a much bigger part of the solution moving forward.

36:04.000 --> 36:09.600
 $20 for two tests is too expensive. Here in Texas, it's hard to find home tests.

36:09.600 --> 36:14.720
 Scheduled tests are two days out and turnaround times are increasing.

36:14.720 --> 36:23.520
 A lot in that email. Talking first about hospital occupancy and how that correlates

36:23.520 --> 36:32.000
 with how much a hospital can handle. That's really the number. What is the percent of beds?

36:32.000 --> 36:37.680
 What's the hospital capacity? What's the percent of filled beds? The other is actually looking at

36:37.680 --> 36:44.560
 ICU, what percent of the beds? In New York, they actually have good sites that you can go to

36:44.560 --> 36:49.760
 keep track of that. That's one of the things. Remember, it's not just about COVID. You break

36:49.760 --> 36:56.480
 your leg. You're in a car accident. You need chemotherapy. There's a myriad of other reasons

36:56.480 --> 37:03.120
 why people end up going to hospital. If those beds are all full of COVID, that's a problem.

37:03.120 --> 37:10.080
 That does strain the system. There is a certain ability to deal with increased capacity surges.

37:10.080 --> 37:15.600
 We see this a lot of times with influenza, respiratory season. That's helpful.

37:15.600 --> 37:24.400
 Testing, yes. As you went through, that was a very sophisticated analysis. If you're in the UK,

37:24.400 --> 37:29.040
 you go to a website, and next thing you know, you've got free testing. Here in the US,

37:29.040 --> 37:35.120
 $10, $11 per test, that does not encourage people to get tested. If anything, it's pennywise pound

37:35.120 --> 37:41.680
 foolish. It is incredibly expensive when someone ends up in the hospital with COVID. It is a lot

37:41.680 --> 37:49.600
 cheaper to prevent that. Jamie writes, I am a primary care clinician, a family nurse practitioner

37:49.600 --> 37:56.640
 of 19 years with a doctor in translational research. Two clinical questions. One, we're in California

37:56.640 --> 38:02.240
 and have vaccine mandates for our public employee sectors. I had my first patient asking for a

38:02.240 --> 38:08.240
 medical excuse from the mandate, which as of now can be religious or medical. This 30 something

38:08.240 --> 38:12.240
 patient is currently undergoing infertility treatments and wants to wait until after she is

38:12.240 --> 38:17.680
 either pregnant or gives birth to get the vaccine. Ask me to put in writing that there are no risks

38:17.680 --> 38:22.640
 to pregnancy or fertility treatments, which of course I cannot do. I discussed with her the risks

38:22.640 --> 38:27.440
 of COVID while being pregnant and asked her to talk to her reproductive health provider and

38:27.440 --> 38:32.080
 come back in two weeks prior to the mandate's effective date so we can make a determination

38:32.080 --> 38:36.320
 while I do more research. I wanted to talk to our fellow clinicians and have an office-wide

38:36.320 --> 38:42.560
 approach knowing that the only real C.I. to vaccination is allergy to vaccine ingredients.

38:42.560 --> 38:46.880
 This person is in a forward-facing public law enforcement position. What would be your guidance

38:46.880 --> 38:52.400
 for this case as well as to guide policy protocols knowing there's always some flexibility for

38:52.400 --> 38:59.120
 clinicians when we issue protocols here. Yeah, so this is a great question, right? Because

38:59.120 --> 39:05.360
 this has been coming up and the patients are angry, right? And the way our healthcare system works.

39:05.360 --> 39:09.680
 Like, well, I'm going to find a doctor who or clinician, a provider, basically someone who's

39:09.680 --> 39:18.160
 going to sign this. And as this emailer, as you write in, there really are only these two exceptions,

39:18.160 --> 39:25.680
 either you have an anaphylactic issue, anaphylactic reaction to this vaccine. You have had an

39:25.680 --> 39:30.640
 anaphylactic reaction to that first dose you got, or you have an anaphylactic issue with one of

39:30.640 --> 39:36.160
 the components. Well, you're going to have to look at the mRNA, that's going to be the PEG 2000.

39:36.880 --> 39:42.400
 Look at J&J, you'll have to see if there's an issue there. But in general, there are very few

39:42.400 --> 39:48.800
 individuals, even individuals that have had other allergic issues, most of them can successfully be

39:48.800 --> 39:55.200
 vaccinated. What you're being asked is really the wrong question, guaranteeing this person

39:55.200 --> 40:01.200
 along healthy life and successful infertility treatments. None of us can do that. The vaccines

40:01.200 --> 40:07.120
 are not without risks. You know, this is like them asking for some sort of guarantee that that seat

40:07.120 --> 40:11.760
 belt will not cause sternal bruising if they get into an accident. Now, I think what this person

40:11.760 --> 40:17.200
 is requesting of you is not reasonable. So what we've tried to do as organizations is just put

40:17.200 --> 40:22.000
 in writing, these are the exceptions. And there was a recent call for Northwest, it was an email

40:22.000 --> 40:29.360
 that went out by David Battnelli, a really superior clinician and leader. And he basically said to

40:29.360 --> 40:33.840
 all the Northwell physicians, these are the exceptions. If you're giving exceptions,

40:33.840 --> 40:39.680
 if you're making up reasons for medical exceptions, that's not okay. And that really sounds what

40:39.680 --> 40:44.320
 this person is saying. They're saying, please give me a medical exception while I go through

40:44.320 --> 40:47.120
 these fertility treatments. That is not in the list of exceptions.

40:47.120 --> 40:54.240
 All right. Question number two, more personal on July 4th, my 45 year old otherwise healthy

40:54.240 --> 41:02.000
 husband developed chest pain, brought him to the ER. He had elevated D dimer, multiple RPE on CTA,

41:02.640 --> 41:08.320
 nodule and the thyroid currently being worked up. He had received a J&J vaccine 10 weeks prior

41:08.320 --> 41:12.960
 to this incident and had been feeling fatigued, reported to VAERS and they followed up right

41:12.960 --> 41:18.480
 away, but we don't know and may never know if this was a causative factor. So the question is,

41:18.480 --> 41:23.360
 should he opt for one of the mRNA injections instead of another J&J?

41:24.320 --> 41:30.080
 So sort of hearing this story, it's hard for me to know if there's any connection. It does not

41:30.080 --> 41:37.600
 sound in any way compelling for there to be a connection here. But this is that gray of medicine

41:37.600 --> 41:43.360
 where we always work where there's no reason not to use an mRNA vaccine in the future.

41:43.920 --> 41:47.920
 And I think that's a reasonable choice. But there's nothing you're telling me here that connects

41:47.920 --> 41:52.160
 the dots for me and makes me worry that this is J&J related.

41:52.880 --> 41:57.840
 All right. One more from Lynn. Just listen to an Andy Slavitt podcast with Johns Hopkins

41:57.840 --> 42:03.600
 epidemiologist Jennifer Newzo, very worthwhile discussion of post-vaccination infection.

42:03.600 --> 42:10.080
 A note that I don't use the word breakthrough. There was some discussion as well about boosters

42:10.080 --> 42:15.360
 and my impression was that global vaccine equity plays too small a role in the booster decision,

42:15.360 --> 42:20.640
 but that's not where my two questions for you lie. After the interview was over Slavitt opined

42:20.640 --> 42:26.000
 on several COVID related matters. He did a good job explaining waning, neutralizing antibodies

42:26.000 --> 42:31.040
 and memory T cells responding to viral attack. He then went on to say that the memory B cell

42:31.040 --> 42:35.760
 and T cell response is slower to appear. And that could lead to symptoms and disease

42:35.760 --> 42:40.720
 before full immune response kicks in. His argument for boosters is that those antibodies that appear

42:40.720 --> 42:45.520
 directly after a boost will afford more protection against symptoms and disease. If you're dead set

42:45.520 --> 42:51.920
 against symptoms, then a booster is your thing. Is this correct? To his credit, Slavitt gives a

42:51.920 --> 42:56.720
 very well articulated discussion on the pros and cons politically and medically of boosters.

42:56.720 --> 43:00.720
 He feels that boosters, the immunocompromised, vulnerable elderly and healthcare workers in the

43:00.720 --> 43:06.720
 U.S. is fair. Boosting everyone else before the rest of the world has vaccine access is not.

43:06.720 --> 43:12.960
 All right, let's do that one first. Okay, so first I'm going to say, Jennifer Newzo,

43:12.960 --> 43:19.440
 she's fantastic, right? And everything Jennifer says, I remember, I actually listened to that

43:19.440 --> 43:26.240
 podcast. And everything Jennifer says, I'm going to, I'm going to sort of thumbs up. She really gives

43:26.240 --> 43:33.920
 an ex expert scientific basis to what she has to say. Now I love Andy. Andy actually is an

43:33.920 --> 43:40.080
 old Optum executive, right? So he did a great job helping with the vaccine rollout. But I worry

43:40.080 --> 43:45.840
 about Andy is he's very articulate. He's very charismatic. He's very persuasive. He's not a doctor.

43:45.840 --> 43:53.280
 And so I often feel like he oversteps, right? So, you know, it's actually interesting if you

43:53.280 --> 43:59.920
 go back and listen to sort of his older podcasts and watches it evolves. Yeah, so I actually listen

43:59.920 --> 44:05.840
 to his podcast. He does a great job. But everything Andy says, take it with a grain of salt. He's a

44:05.840 --> 44:11.360
 great logistics guy. He's the guy you call if you want help, maybe using PEPFAR to get those

44:11.360 --> 44:16.320
 vaccines out there. But if you want good science, if you want good medical advice,

44:17.040 --> 44:22.480
 listen to his guests. So I would say if you have can only listen to one podcast, listen to

44:22.480 --> 44:28.160
 Twiv, not Slavitt. Yes. All right. Second question, Slavitt said that smarter people

44:28.160 --> 44:34.080
 than he are pushing for the J and J vaccinated to get an mRNA vaccine. Where's the data that

44:34.080 --> 44:40.160
 supports this? And would it be one dose or two? Yeah, I remember when he made that comment and,

44:40.160 --> 44:45.120
 you know, sort of say, he talked to a whole bunch of really smart people. And yeah, you know,

44:45.120 --> 44:50.880
 again, Andy Slavitt, he's charismatic. He's a great public speaker. But yeah, take it with

44:50.880 --> 44:54.560
 grain of salt. There's no science that supports that recommendation. I don't know who these smart

44:54.560 --> 45:00.480
 people are. By the way, Lynn has written into Twiv. She is the retired molecular biologist from

45:00.480 --> 45:07.680
 Western Massachusetts and grandmother to the epitope obsessed grandson. Oh, I love that.

45:07.680 --> 45:14.880
 Isn't that great? That's COVID-19 clinical update number 79 with Dr. Daniel Griffin.

45:14.880 --> 45:44.720
 Thank you, Daniel. Oh, thank you. And everyone, including events in BC.
