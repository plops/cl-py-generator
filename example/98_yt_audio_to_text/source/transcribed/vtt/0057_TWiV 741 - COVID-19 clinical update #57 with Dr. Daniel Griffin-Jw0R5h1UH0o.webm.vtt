 This week in virology, the podcast about viruses, the kind that make you sick.

00:10.400 --> 00:21.280
 From Microbe TV, this is Twiv. This week in virology, episode 741 recorded on April 8th, 2021.

00:21.280 --> 00:27.120
 I'm Vincent Rackeniello, and you're listening to the podcast all about viruses. Joining me today

00:27.120 --> 00:36.320
 from New York, Daniel Griffin. Hello, everyone. That's right, Daniel. This is update number 57,

00:36.320 --> 00:42.800
 and how are things going this week? They are a little bit better, but what

00:42.800 --> 00:46.480
 Twiver are you at? What Twiver are we up to Vincent to say there? 741.

00:47.440 --> 00:53.360
 741, okay. I'm looking for the 747, like, because that's the big one with the upper deck.

00:53.360 --> 01:00.960
 Then after that, there's a 777, right? And then the 787. We'll go through all those. Don't worry.

01:03.440 --> 01:07.200
 All right, let me start with my quotation, and then I will give the update on where we are.

01:08.080 --> 01:12.880
 So this is be kind for everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle.

01:13.840 --> 01:22.800
 And this is actually from Philo of Alexandria, 20 BCE to 20 CE. So this goes back away, but I

01:22.800 --> 01:29.760
 think maybe we need to remember. We've come out of this pandemic, and a lot of ways worse,

01:29.760 --> 01:35.760
 a lot of ways divided, hostile. Sometimes I feel like I'm in a Monty Python movie,

01:35.760 --> 01:41.600
 and someone sees their neighbors, they run away because this actually developed what I'm going to

01:41.600 --> 01:48.160
 point. The fear of normal, phone know. A lot of us are pretty traumatized from this last year,

01:48.160 --> 01:53.280
 so I deal if we can all start working together. We are on the same side relative to the virus.

01:54.240 --> 02:00.320
 So my three quotations, as always, never miss an opportunity to vaccinate, never miss an

02:00.320 --> 02:06.640
 opportunity to test, and never waste a vaccine dose. Let's get those vaccines into arms. The

02:06.640 --> 02:12.720
 fridges and freezers do not need the vaccines people do. Where are we right now? What's sort of

02:12.720 --> 02:18.800
 the update? Worldwide, I don't often mention this, but worldwide, let's look, where are we

02:18.800 --> 02:26.080
 looking? The world picture worldwide, the case numbers and deaths are rising. With over a half

02:26.080 --> 02:32.320
 a million new cases per day, it's probably more, but that's what we're hearing, over 10,000 deaths

02:32.320 --> 02:41.280
 per day, again, probably higher. This is certainly not over. What about here in the US? I like to

02:41.280 --> 02:47.360
 think that the experience in Israel is encouraging. They're ahead of us. The experience in the UK

02:47.360 --> 02:51.760
 is encouraging. They're also ahead of us. The US, hopefully we're going to be next in line,

02:51.760 --> 02:57.440
 sort of a beacon of what happens with vaccinations, but we are still on this plateau here in the US.

02:58.960 --> 03:05.920
 Thanks, mainly to a few states. I call you out. Everyone in Michigan, Florida, New York, New Jersey,

03:05.920 --> 03:11.760
 and Pennsylvania, we're still seeing lots of cases, high positivity rates at these places.

03:11.760 --> 03:16.880
 Now, Georgia, oddly enough, is not reporting a lot of cases. They're not in the top 10s

03:16.880 --> 03:23.120
 in terms of cases, but they are in the top three in terms of daily deaths. I say that a little

03:23.120 --> 03:28.000
 tongue in cheek, but there certainly are some issues with not doing enough tests around the

03:28.000 --> 03:34.080
 country, particularly in certain places. You can't hide the deaths. I guess you probably could,

03:34.080 --> 03:39.040
 as we learned, but when you see those deaths, it really suggests that we're not capturing all

03:39.040 --> 03:45.280
 those cases. I did want to point out, isn't the CDC in Georgia? It means you'd be doing a better

03:45.280 --> 03:52.640
 job of testing, tracking, and everything else. Across the US, we have less testing, but we still

03:52.640 --> 04:00.560
 have the same number of new cases each day. I'm not sure that this is as low a plateau as people

04:00.560 --> 04:06.640
 might think. The same number of people are in the hospital across the board, certainly here in

04:06.640 --> 04:12.960
 New York since February. There are fewer deaths per day. It's odd that we're celebrating that we're

04:12.960 --> 04:18.640
 under 1,000, that we're still seeing 600, 800, 800 a day. That's pretty high plateau.

04:19.600 --> 04:25.520
 Things that have changed is the age of the patients in the hospital, and the age of those testing

04:25.520 --> 04:30.080
 positive on average is decreased. That's something that's being reported. That's certainly something

04:30.080 --> 04:35.680
 we're seeing in our, we still do a tremendous amount of testing here in the tri-state area

04:35.680 --> 04:41.200
 at pro health and opt-in tri-state. That's my update, but now let's get into children and COVID.

04:41.200 --> 04:46.000
 This is always a hot topic. We've covered that full in-person learning can be done

04:46.000 --> 04:52.160
 safely. Now, we have guidance from the CDC, but I'm getting lots of questions about how do we

04:52.160 --> 04:58.480
 actually guarantee that this is done safely and not just done? This is interesting.

04:58.480 --> 05:04.160
 So I'm going to throw in, and this is sort of thrown out of phase order, but it's in the children

05:04.160 --> 05:12.480
 topic. We got some updates about the multi-system inflammatory syndrome during the COVID-19 pandemic

05:12.480 --> 05:20.000
 in children. So what I like to point out is that children certainly are at low, lower risk than

05:20.000 --> 05:26.240
 adults, but they are not at no risk. So let's put some context here. So in JAMA pediatrics,

05:26.240 --> 05:32.400
 the article trends in geographic and temporal distribution of US children with multi-system

05:32.400 --> 05:39.280
 inflammatory syndrome during the COVID-19 pandemic was published. This was a cross-sectional study

05:39.280 --> 05:47.040
 of 1,733 patients with multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children. So the miss C.

05:47.840 --> 05:54.640
 And the analysis included patients with illness onset from March 2020 to January 2021 that

05:54.640 --> 05:59.600
 met the miss C case definition. Patients with Miss C predominately presented with

06:00.160 --> 06:06.480
 gastrointestinal symptoms, such as abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhea, as well as skin rash

06:06.480 --> 06:13.040
 and conjunctival hyperremia. So that's a redness to the eyes, to the whites of the eyes.

06:13.040 --> 06:20.400
 Most patients developed hypotension or shock with about 60% overall being admitted to the

06:20.400 --> 06:25.840
 intensive care unit. And I think I've mentioned that this went from early on being less to 50%

06:26.400 --> 06:33.680
 to later on at being 80, 90%. So sort of evolving numbers. Myocarditis, so inflammation of the heart

06:33.680 --> 06:39.840
 muscle, cardiac dysfunction, and coronary artery dilation. So these are the blood vessels that

06:39.840 --> 06:44.880
 wrap around the heart actually dilating. That was reported in about a third of patients.

06:44.880 --> 06:50.960
 Now, most miss C illness are believed to result from asymptomatic or mild COVID-19.

06:51.920 --> 06:56.400
 I think sort of want to reinforce that asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 upfront.

06:57.200 --> 07:03.520
 With hyper inflammation coinciding with peak antibody production, several weeks after that

07:03.520 --> 07:10.560
 initial SARS-CoV-2 infections. So patients with Miss C were reported to have significantly

07:10.560 --> 07:17.280
 higher titers of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain IgG-80 bodies compared with

07:17.280 --> 07:23.920
 other patients hospitalized with COVID-19. So just sort of an update. This is out there.

07:23.920 --> 07:28.480
 We're getting more information on it. But let's talk a little bit about the school opening plans.

07:28.480 --> 07:34.640
 I was getting a lot of texts and messages about one of the local school districts that is

07:34.640 --> 07:38.800
 planning an opening. And they started laying out their guidelines, they're going to separate

07:38.800 --> 07:43.440
 the desk by three feet. The children are going to be wearing masks at all times.

07:43.440 --> 07:48.000
 They're actually going to have these plexiglass dividers. So I'm hearing all this, this sounds

07:48.000 --> 07:54.960
 encouraging, upgrading of the ventilation system. But then I had a very interesting quarantine

07:54.960 --> 07:59.120
 outline. And what they were saying was that, okay, we're putting all these things in place.

07:59.120 --> 08:05.680
 But if a child tests positive, anyone within three feet of them, so the desks within three

08:05.680 --> 08:10.800
 of them, they will all be quarantined. And since this school is one where the children go to

08:10.800 --> 08:16.880
 different classrooms, that one sort of index positive case will then affect, I guess you could do the

08:16.880 --> 08:21.920
 math on this, right? Like three in front, three behind and one on each side. So eight kids from

08:21.920 --> 08:27.200
 each class will be quarantined for the required quarantine period. And some of the questions the

08:27.200 --> 08:32.480
 parents were asking, well, if it's safe to be within three feet with all this mitigation,

08:32.480 --> 08:38.160
 then why are these kids going into quarantine? If our kids are going to actually have exposures

08:38.160 --> 08:43.760
 in school, you know, and it's sort of a back and forth. And I think that one of the things that

08:43.760 --> 08:48.880
 may be missing here for a lot of the schools is they're being asked to open, but they don't

08:48.880 --> 08:52.960
 necessarily have the professional guidance to help them put the whole plan together.

08:53.680 --> 08:59.440
 I think this has come up many times. If you do not have an exposure, you do not need to quarantine.

08:59.440 --> 09:03.760
 And if you're setting up a school plan that's going to actually provide exposure opportunities

09:03.760 --> 09:08.560
 for the children, that's not a great school opening plan. So, you know, reach out. If you

09:08.560 --> 09:12.720
 don't have the expertise, if you don't know how to do this, a lot of people don't have expertise.

09:12.720 --> 09:17.440
 I mean, a superintendent, a principal, a teacher, I don't want to be the one, you know, teaching your

09:17.440 --> 09:21.760
 high schoolers or your middle schoolers. You probably don't want to be the one coming up with

09:21.760 --> 09:27.200
 school reopening plans during a pandemic without some communication. So I throw that out there. I

09:27.200 --> 09:34.000
 do think that we can open schools safely, but you have to have the understanding and the science

09:34.000 --> 09:39.280
 to do this. And this ties directly into transmission. And today we're going to talk a lot about

09:39.280 --> 09:45.600
 transmission. So much about COVID-19 has been controversial and either content and even

09:45.600 --> 09:50.880
 contentious. So remember my quotation? We're all in this together. The virus is the enemy,

09:50.880 --> 09:55.840
 not your neighbor. And I guess I shouldn't be surprised. I still remember it was during my

09:55.840 --> 10:00.400
 graduate training when, you know, it almost came to fisticuffs. You know, I was having a dispute with

10:00.400 --> 10:05.600
 with another one of the graduate students about whether or not NF Kappa B activation was essential

10:05.600 --> 10:12.240
 for TH 17 differentiation. Really? Really? That was enough to get like an overheated argument?

10:13.200 --> 10:18.240
 Here, we're actually talking about something that affects people's lives. And, you know,

10:18.240 --> 10:25.600
 this is a scientific question. And I think we need to be level headed when we discuss

10:25.600 --> 10:30.240
 what do we know about this so that we can make appropriate decisions to protect everyone.

10:31.200 --> 10:36.880
 I mean, I think one of the issues, I will say, the issue of transmission was complicated by

10:36.880 --> 10:42.880
 terms of art. There are certain words that we use in science. There's certain words that we use

10:42.880 --> 10:49.520
 even slightly differently in the clinical arena, terms of art, such as airborne. And there are

10:49.520 --> 10:55.440
 common usage of these terms by the general public. So a lot of times we would ask that question,

10:55.440 --> 11:00.160
 you know, is this airborne? I remember a wonderful article. It may not be airborne,

11:00.160 --> 11:04.960
 but it's borne by the air, right? I mean, so there was a lot of confusion, like what is happening

11:04.960 --> 11:12.400
 here? So in the open forum, infectious disease journal, the article SARS-CoV-2 infection among

11:12.400 --> 11:18.160
 healthcare workers, despite the use of surgical masks and physical distancing, the role of airborne

11:18.160 --> 11:23.760
 transmission was published by a group out of Israel. So this was a case study where the authors

11:23.760 --> 11:30.400
 described a single source outbreak of COVID-19 from an asymptomatic patient to nine healthcare

11:30.400 --> 11:36.480
 workers and room contacts in a general pediatric ward, despite meeting the current guidelines for

11:36.480 --> 11:43.040
 PPE and the wearing of surgical masks. Now, due to confirmation bias, I actually worry about this

11:43.040 --> 11:48.080
 article. I think it's going to be embraced by sort of both sides of this controversy right back

11:48.080 --> 11:53.840
 to sides again. So I'm going to take a moment here and we're going to have to learn to be a

11:53.840 --> 11:58.320
 little painful, but we're going to do a little vocabulary here. But I think this is critical.

11:58.320 --> 12:02.640
 This is important. This is how we keep ourselves safe. And I think understanding these terms are

12:02.640 --> 12:09.040
 important. So the first term, respiratory droplets. These are small drops or portions of liquid

12:09.840 --> 12:16.720
 that are in the five to 10 micron range. These are expelled when a person coughs, sneezes,

12:16.720 --> 12:22.480
 sigs, or as we now know, I think is more generally appreciated, talking as well. People always

12:22.480 --> 12:26.000
 think about this. Well, you're not coughing, you're not sneezing. If you're not sick, how are you

12:26.000 --> 12:35.120
 spreading this? Just talking is creating these droplets. That's why a person can be pre-symptomatic

12:35.120 --> 12:41.600
 and still create them. You do not need to be coughing, sneezing. Droplet nuclei or aerosols,

12:41.600 --> 12:46.880
 right? Now, we're talking about a term of art. These are small drops that are less than five

12:46.880 --> 12:53.920
 microns. And due to their small size, they can actually remain airborne for extended periods of

12:53.920 --> 13:01.040
 time and transmit over significant distances. Then we have follomites and these are contaminated

13:01.040 --> 13:09.040
 surfaces. So what about airborne transmission? Now, the CDC points out that this is a specialized

13:09.040 --> 13:15.920
 use word in medicine and public health and is used to describe infections capable of being

13:15.920 --> 13:22.640
 transmitted through exposure to infections, pathogen containing small droplets, and particles

13:22.640 --> 13:27.760
 suspended in the air over long distances that persist in the air for long times.

13:28.720 --> 13:33.200
 And where are we with all this? I just showed you an article, oh my gosh, with an instance of

13:33.200 --> 13:39.840
 airborne transmission, despite masks. So as per the CDC, the principal mode by which people are

13:39.840 --> 13:46.240
 infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is through exposure to respiratory

13:46.240 --> 13:54.160
 droplets carrying infectious virus. They do go on to say airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2

13:54.160 --> 14:00.080
 can occur under special circumstances. And those with a special circumstances that we

14:00.080 --> 14:06.720
 describe. So what are those special circumstances? Enclosed spaces, right? We keep harping on

14:06.720 --> 14:12.880
 indoor versus outdoor. Enclosed spaces within which an infectious person either exposed

14:12.880 --> 14:17.600
 susceptible people at the same time or to which susceptible people were exposed shortly after

14:17.600 --> 14:25.040
 the infectious person had left that space. So that indoor poor air circulation, prolonged exposure

14:25.040 --> 14:31.920
 to respiratory particles. Remember, this is a continuum. There's no plexiglass sort of shield

14:31.920 --> 14:39.520
 at this distinction between the different micron sizes. So shouting, singing, exercising,

14:39.520 --> 14:44.960
 you're actually going to increase the concentration of suspended respiratory droplets in the airspace.

14:44.960 --> 14:50.480
 So prolonged exposure. And then inadequate ventilation, which all this is all tied together,

14:50.480 --> 14:56.400
 or poor handling. So you're allowing a buildup of suspended small respiratory droplets and

14:56.400 --> 15:02.960
 particles. So that's your suburban home without good air exchanges. So I think that we can very

15:02.960 --> 15:09.920
 clearly at this point say that the CDC, the WHO, and the science supports that the principal mode

15:09.920 --> 15:16.160
 here is respiratory droplets. Airborne transmission is rare, but can happen in

15:16.160 --> 15:23.440
 circumstances. And fomites contact. I think the current CDC estimate is that maybe one in every

15:23.440 --> 15:31.520
 10,000 infection was due to surfaces. So just rethink all that bleach and chlorox and everything

15:31.520 --> 15:39.520
 else. So on April, on April 5th, so Monday, April 5th, the CDC published an updated science brief

15:39.520 --> 15:46.160
 addressing fomite transmission. And this was titled SARS-CoV-2 and surface fomite transmission

15:46.160 --> 15:52.800
 for indoor community environments. And I'm sorry to the makers of bleach, but this goes along the

15:52.800 --> 15:57.600
 lines of what we've been discussing. But instead of focusing on the distinction in respiratory

15:57.600 --> 16:04.560
 droplets and aerosols, it focuses on getting COVID-19. So getting that virus and developing

16:04.560 --> 16:09.840
 COVID-19 from surfaces and the summary statement, the principal mode by which people are infected

16:09.840 --> 16:16.160
 with SARS-CoV-2 is through exposure to respiratory droplets. It is possible for people to be infected

16:16.160 --> 16:21.360
 through contact with contaminated surfaces or objects, fomites, but the risk is generally

16:21.360 --> 16:27.200
 considered to be low. So this doesn't mean we're walking around with unclean hands. I still want

16:27.200 --> 16:35.040
 people to wash their hands. But I think there has been a lot of resources put into hygiene theater.

16:35.600 --> 16:40.400
 And they actually conclude in the statement that in most situations, cleaning surfaces using soap

16:40.400 --> 16:47.760
 or detergent and not requiring this disinfection is enough to reduce the risk testing. The journal

16:47.760 --> 16:54.480
 of clinical microbiology published a nice meta analysis performance of saliva, oral pharyngeal

16:54.480 --> 17:02.880
 swabs and nasal swabs for SARS-CoV-2, molecular detection, a systematic review and meta analysis.

17:02.880 --> 17:08.800
 Now, for starters, what is a meta analysis? So in the edited words of Mark Chris Lap,

17:08.800 --> 17:14.480
 Perciflagger's infectious disease, Puskass Fade, this is when you pile a whole bunch of studies

17:14.480 --> 17:21.760
 on top of each other and they suddenly turn into gold. I think Mark will be turning over in his

17:21.760 --> 17:26.480
 grave even though he's still alive. It just has decided to stop Puskassing. So he's only died in a

17:26.480 --> 17:33.280
 certain way. But this was really a high-level summary where they looked through. They found

17:33.280 --> 17:44.400
 1,253 unique citations. They then drilled down to identify 25 saliva studies, 11 nasal swabs,

17:44.400 --> 17:51.680
 6 oral pharyngeal and 4 oral pharyngeal nasal swab studies. So from all the different

17:51.680 --> 17:57.360
 sources, what they were using is nasal pharyngeal swabs of the gold standard and saying if we do

17:57.360 --> 18:03.440
 other methods, how much of the time are we able to pick that up? And so they basically came down with

18:04.320 --> 18:12.000
 the nasal swabs. We're picking up about 82%. The oral pharyngeal, we're picking up about 84%

18:12.000 --> 18:18.080
 and the saliva, we're picking up about 88% of those that were picked up with the nasal pharyngeal

18:18.080 --> 18:24.400
 swabs. They also reported a few things that I found interesting. They reported finding several

18:24.400 --> 18:32.000
 studies that the unsupervised, self-collected nasal swab specimens had higher percent positives

18:32.000 --> 18:37.760
 compared to those collected by healthcare workers. So I was trying to analyze this. Is this that

18:37.760 --> 18:42.960
 healthcare workers are too gentle? Is it that when no one's watching, people are willing to get a

18:42.960 --> 18:48.640
 much better, deeper sample. So you turn away and tell them to go at it. I also thought it was

18:48.640 --> 18:53.360
 interesting. A lot of times we have people hold a mask and they cough and they try to get up this

18:53.360 --> 18:58.800
 deep throat saliva and we tell them you can't eat, you can't drink, you can't brush your teeth.

19:00.160 --> 19:05.920
 That really didn't seem to do much in terms of sensitivity. So maybe it's a little nicer. People

19:05.920 --> 19:12.480
 can show up for their testing with brushed teeth and having some adequate hydration. There were a

19:12.480 --> 19:17.360
 number of limitations though I thought in this study. And my big one, and I think all the listeners

19:17.360 --> 19:22.800
 will guess at it, was where are the CT values? And I think we've learned over the last year that

19:22.800 --> 19:29.040
 nasal pharyngeal swabs are very sensitive, but sometimes maybe are they too sensitive to answer

19:29.040 --> 19:36.320
 certain questions. So if saliva, for instance, is missing these low-level RNA PCR positives,

19:36.960 --> 19:42.960
 weeks after the acute infection, do we really care? Is that really a limitation? Is this really

19:42.960 --> 19:48.560
 relevant if we're testing to avoid transmissions such as might be done for certain sporting programs

19:48.560 --> 19:55.280
 or now we know New York working with Mount Sinai is going to develop this large-scale saliva

19:55.280 --> 20:03.280
 testing availability for opening large venue events. If those people have a few thousand

20:03.280 --> 20:09.440
 bits of RNA, am I concerned as someone going into a venue, particularly as a vaccinated person

20:09.440 --> 20:16.320
 going into a venue, versus someone who has a high positivity, such a large amount of RNA that's

20:16.320 --> 20:21.680
 being picked up by antigen tests and all these others? So I think we have a lot of good testing

20:21.680 --> 20:27.280
 options and we just need to ask what question are we answering or asking when we do these tests?

20:27.280 --> 20:34.400
 Active vaccination. There does seem to be some growing evidence that there may be an actual

20:34.400 --> 20:41.680
 connection between the blood clotting and the platelet disorder and the AstraZeneca vaccine.

20:41.680 --> 20:51.040
 I used a lot of qualifications in there. It still appears that the incidence of this clotting and

20:51.040 --> 20:58.560
 platelet complication is rare and the risk of a COVID complication in most cases is significantly

20:58.560 --> 21:06.320
 higher if you remain unvaccinated. But this is evolving. The Medicines Health Care Products

21:06.320 --> 21:13.440
 Regulatory Agency, that's the MHRA, they regulate medicines, medicinal devices, blood components for

21:13.440 --> 21:23.680
 transfusion in the UK. They recorded 30 cases in 18 million vaccinated individuals. So we're

21:23.680 --> 21:31.200
 looking at a complication rate of one in 600,000, but there have been seven deaths. There may be

21:31.200 --> 21:37.360
 an issue with the age skewing. This may be something that is clustered more in younger individuals.

21:37.360 --> 21:43.760
 And so we're actually certainly seeing some changes where there's a preferential use of this

21:43.760 --> 21:49.440
 vaccine in older individuals and a preferential use of other vaccines in younger individuals.

21:49.440 --> 21:54.480
 So this is an evolving story. And as we learn more, we're going to have to decide what to do

21:54.480 --> 22:00.400
 here with this information. Just an update on the Pfizer EUA expansion, right? Let's get vaccines

22:00.400 --> 22:08.480
 to younger individuals or the option to have vaccines in younger 12, 13, 14, 15. And as far as

22:08.480 --> 22:15.680
 timing, right? We heard about the data. There is a required 15-day notice of intent to submit

22:15.680 --> 22:22.720
 before the FDA performs their review. So Paul Offit, who's a member of the Vaccines and Related

22:22.720 --> 22:28.640
 Biological Products Advisory Committee, just was saying the other day that so far that notice has

22:28.640 --> 22:35.040
 not been given. So, you know, whether it's later this month, I think it's going to be May at the

22:35.040 --> 22:42.320
 earliest that we see a potential e-way expansion down to our kids, 12, 13, 14, and 15. Passive

22:42.320 --> 22:48.480
 vaccination, right? The monoclonals. This seems to be going much better as far as getting these

22:48.480 --> 22:54.000
 off the shelves and to the patients. I think seeing the phase three data, all the help that

22:54.000 --> 22:59.440
 we've gotten from a lot of individuals to get the word out has helped. I have to say, on our last

23:00.000 --> 23:05.600
 tri-state urgent care call, this week the comment was that our whole book and infusion center was

23:05.600 --> 23:09.920
 basically getting fully booked. And we're all questions about how much capacity did we have

23:10.480 --> 23:16.800
 for our in-home infusion program. So people are really getting out and they're getting these

23:16.800 --> 23:22.560
 treatments. And I have to say this is tremendous. When we see these individuals' experience we have

23:22.560 --> 23:28.320
 is they get the infusion. And 36 hours later, they're really reporting sort of that Superman

23:28.320 --> 23:34.000
 feeling. I actually spent some time recently over at one of the Catholic hospitals in our area,

23:34.000 --> 23:39.520
 St. Francis Hospital, speaking with Stefan Moldauer, he's the head of the ER there,

23:39.520 --> 23:44.800
 just making sure we have everything firing as smoothly as we can on all cylinders.

23:45.760 --> 23:51.280
 Now, if I got that expression, correct. But right, we have the ability with monoclonals

23:51.280 --> 23:57.520
 to either go to outpatient infusion centers, to go to certain ERs, to go to certain infusion tents

23:57.520 --> 24:03.280
 that are set up outside of ERs, and to get even in-home infusions. And this seems to all be going

24:03.280 --> 24:08.480
 very smoothly with getting people access to the monoclonal cocktails. Some exciting developments

24:08.480 --> 24:15.600
 before we move forward. Right now, as mentioned, that's great and all, but this is putting an IV in.

24:15.600 --> 24:20.320
 It's a, well, 21 minutes we're allowed to, but a lot of centers are spending a full hour of the

24:20.320 --> 24:26.880
 infusion, plus a post-infusion observation time. V-R-G-S-K, which is trying to get their product

24:26.880 --> 24:34.640
 EUA, is also looking at expanding into an IM, an intra-muscular preparation. So right now,

24:34.640 --> 24:40.720
 they have Comet Peak, which is an ongoing phase two trial. And they're really looking at safety,

24:40.720 --> 24:49.760
 viral kinetics, pharmacodynamics, doing this as an IM, but they're about to fire up Comet tail.

24:49.760 --> 24:55.600
 And this will be a phase three trial, which is going to be starting in the next month or so,

24:55.600 --> 25:02.800
 and will be administering these IM products to high-risk adults, showing hopefully the same benefit

25:02.800 --> 25:07.680
 for reducing hospitalizations and deaths. But you can imagine the improved access. You getting

25:07.680 --> 25:14.080
 something like an EpiPen, where it can be just delivered from your local pharmacy, or maybe it's

25:14.080 --> 25:20.960
 what's brought in by an infusion team, or a home care team, and boom, just right into the muscle.

25:20.960 --> 25:24.000
 We'll talk about whether or not you need to withdraw that plunger when you do that,

25:24.560 --> 25:29.520
 and then going ahead with the treatment. Incubation, post-exposure period. Remember,

25:29.520 --> 25:35.840
 tests do not predict the future. I was on a call last night with a cab. And yeah, you got to keep

25:35.840 --> 25:41.760
 saying that. I use the pregnancy test analogy. Once someone is exposed, there's a period of time

25:41.760 --> 25:46.800
 when they can go on to become positive. If someone gets exposed, they immediately test,

25:46.800 --> 25:51.840
 it's probably going to be negative. But that does not mean that they will not go on and become

25:51.840 --> 25:58.880
 positive in the next two to 14 days. Once they get into that period of detectable viral replication,

25:58.880 --> 26:06.000
 remember our passive monoclonals, our passive vaccination. So time for monoclonals and monitoring,

26:06.000 --> 26:12.720
 no steroids, no antibiotics in that first week. If you do get into that early inflammatory phase,

26:12.720 --> 26:19.360
 second week, if the oxygen saturation is drop below 94, then you think of steroids, oxygen,

26:19.360 --> 26:25.360
 anticoagulation, perhaps from decivir. Most of these folks are not coming in with infections.

26:25.360 --> 26:31.120
 That is a later stage issue. And we got a lot of information. I'm going to say close on this,

26:31.120 --> 26:34.320
 but this is actually a big chunk. We're going to talk what we've learned about

26:34.320 --> 26:43.200
 about tail phase and long COVID. So in the BMJ, we saw the article post COVID syndrome in individuals

26:43.200 --> 26:50.720
 admitted to hospital with COVID-19 retrospective cohort study. So in this observational retrospective

26:50.720 --> 26:59.520
 matched cohort study, they reported on the outcomes with a mean of 140 days for 47,780

26:59.520 --> 27:06.160
 individuals that had been admitted to the NHS hospitals in England for COVID-19 and had been

27:06.160 --> 27:11.760
 discharged alive, right? So these are the individuals that got almost 50,000 that got COVID were in

27:11.760 --> 27:18.800
 the hospital. Nearly one third were readmitted and more than 10% died during this follow-up.

27:18.800 --> 27:23.520
 Those with COVID-19 were diagnosed with major adverse cardiovascular events,

27:23.520 --> 27:30.160
 liver disease, kidney disease, diabetes, after discharge, what were the rates?

27:30.160 --> 27:39.040
 Respectively, 3, 2.8, 1.9, and 1.5 times more. So major cardiovascular, three times more likely,

27:39.040 --> 27:44.640
 liver disease, almost three times more likely, kidney disease, twice as likely,

27:44.640 --> 27:51.440
 diabetes 1.5 times more frequently than in the matched control group. This is a bit of an issue,

27:51.440 --> 27:58.720
 right? I'm looking forward to more data on this, but we also had another study, and I think this

27:58.720 --> 28:04.560
 is getting a lot of attention. And this was in the Lancet Psychiatry Journal, and this paper,

28:04.560 --> 28:15.360
 6-month neurological and psychiatric outcomes in 236,379 survivors of COVID-19, a retrospective

28:15.360 --> 28:22.400
 cohort study using electronic health records. So this is really robust data, right? You know,

28:22.400 --> 28:29.680
 almost a quarter million survivors. So this was a retrospective cohort study and a time to event

28:29.680 --> 28:35.920
 analysis, and they were using data obtained from the tri-NEXS electronic health records. So

28:36.640 --> 28:42.640
 over 81 million patients in this database, and I should say this database exists, right? I think

28:42.640 --> 28:49.760
 we were painfully hearing of some early databases that were figments, but the primary cohort

28:49.760 --> 28:58.960
 comprised 236,379 patients who had a COVID-19 diagnosis, and they had one matched control cohort,

28:58.960 --> 29:03.760
 including patients diagnosed with influenza, other matched cohorts who could have patients

29:03.760 --> 29:09.280
 diagnosed with other respiratory tract infections during the same period. And they reported that

29:09.280 --> 29:16.080
 the estimated incidence of a neurological or psychiatric diagnosis in the following six months

29:16.080 --> 29:26.000
 was 33.6%. So a third of these survivors of COVID-19 hospitalization. If you were admitted to an ICU,

29:26.000 --> 29:33.840
 the estimated incidence was almost 50%, it was 46.4. So this is huge. And now what were these

29:33.840 --> 29:40.800
 neurological diagnoses? Intracranial hemorrhage, ischemic stroke, Parkinson's disease,

29:40.800 --> 29:48.000
 Guillain-Barre, nerve, nerve root, plexus disorders, myel, neural junction, and muscle disease,

29:48.000 --> 29:55.600
 encephalitis, dementia, psychosis, mood and anxiety disorders, substance use disorders,

29:56.240 --> 30:03.440
 and a lot of insomnia. Now I have to say this report is consistent with the work of some

30:03.440 --> 30:10.720
 of my colleagues at UHG. I think they're a little frustrated because their study is still winding

30:10.720 --> 30:16.800
 its way through peer review. But I had the opportunity earlier this week, the pleasure I should say

30:16.800 --> 30:21.680
 of speaking with our pro-health neurology group. I always like to get this is what we see in the

30:21.680 --> 30:26.480
 literature, this is what the studies are showing, what are we seeing in our clinical practice.

30:26.480 --> 30:32.160
 And so several of the neurologists were describing the challenges that we're seeing here in the

30:32.160 --> 30:38.720
 tri-state area. Presentations consisted with small fiber neuropathies with burning sensations,

30:39.440 --> 30:45.840
 and a lot of issues with either new onset headaches or an escalation of headaches from

30:45.840 --> 30:51.840
 intermittent to chronic. So unfortunately a growing number of individuals who maybe had

30:51.840 --> 30:58.640
 an intermittent vascular or migraine disorder, and now they're in constant pain, really challenging

30:58.640 --> 31:05.040
 to treat these individuals. I think this will get a lot of attention because it's quite upsetting,

31:05.040 --> 31:09.840
 I think, to not have your mind working, to be in constant pain, to be suffering.

31:09.840 --> 31:16.080
 I think that's enough bad news, right? It's enough bad news. I'll throw a little bit of good news in

31:16.080 --> 31:20.480
 here, and I think this is some perspective on the good news as well. We've heard a little bit,

31:20.480 --> 31:26.080
 and I've shared a little bit about the potential benefit of vaccination on long COVID. And I've

31:26.080 --> 31:30.960
 been seeing that. A lot of us who take care of a large cohort of patients who are never sick

31:30.960 --> 31:36.000
 enough to get in the hospital, but continue to suffer with the brain fog, the fatigue,

31:36.000 --> 31:42.560
 all these other disorders. We are seeing a large chunk of them report feeling better with vaccination.

31:42.560 --> 31:48.080
 But I reached out to Lawrence Schulman. He's one of our pulmonologists, and talking to him about

31:48.080 --> 31:53.360
 what about people that were sick enough? Now they have pulmonary scarring. Now they have things

31:53.360 --> 32:00.240
 that I just wouldn't really think a vaccination would reverse. In those individuals, a lot of our

32:00.240 --> 32:05.680
 long-term care COVID or post-COVID recovery centers, where they're dealing people who had

32:06.400 --> 32:11.760
 cardiac insults and pulmonary issues, a lot of this, I have to say, unfortunately, there

32:11.760 --> 32:17.440
 was a subset of patients where this is not reversible by vaccination. So still encouraging all these

32:17.440 --> 32:23.280
 individuals to get vaccinated, but it does sort of temper that optimism. There does appear to be

32:23.280 --> 32:27.840
 certain patient populations that are more likely to benefit from vaccinations, but there are certain

32:27.840 --> 32:34.640
 other individuals where a lot of the damage is done, the scarring is there. So I will close by saying,

32:34.640 --> 32:40.800
 thanks again for all the support we've had. This will be our final month, right? April, we are

32:40.800 --> 32:46.240
 supporting the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, and part of that support

32:46.240 --> 32:54.320
 will be providing scholarships for early career women investigators from low-income parts of the

32:54.320 --> 32:59.840
 world. So we're excited to do that. We're excited to allow them to attend the fall meeting,

33:00.800 --> 33:04.080
 and then hopefully really give them a boost and do something about

33:04.080 --> 33:09.440
 so many of the inequities that currently exist. All right, time for a few emails for

33:09.440 --> 33:16.640
 Daniel. You can send yours to Daniel at microbe.tv. The first is from Alida in Canada, who's a nurse

33:17.360 --> 33:23.440
 and is curious about you're saying it is a must to aspirate before injecting an IM.

33:23.440 --> 33:28.240
 In Canada, we have not done this for more than 20 years. I started nursing in 2000,

33:28.240 --> 33:33.840
 and I've never aspirated. I've given thousands of vaccines and injections. CDC does not recommend

33:33.840 --> 33:42.000
 aspiration, just my thoughts. No, they're more than just your thoughts. You're right.

33:43.120 --> 33:48.320
 So what is this issue of aspiration pulling back the plunger while doing an IM injection?

33:50.960 --> 33:54.480
 Hopefully I didn't say it's a must. Hopefully I said this is fairly standard,

33:54.480 --> 34:02.560
 still common. Should it be? So what does the CDC say? What does the WHO say? What is the science?

34:02.560 --> 34:07.600
 What is actually recommended and actually is not pulling back perhaps best practice?

34:07.600 --> 34:15.040
 Let's go through this. Thank you for asking this question. As per the CDC, aspiration before

34:15.040 --> 34:20.400
 injection of vaccines or toxoids, pulling back on the syringe plunger after needle insertion,

34:20.400 --> 34:25.120
 but before injection is not necessary because no large blood vessels are present at the

34:25.120 --> 34:31.360
 recommended injection sites. Any process that includes aspiration may be more painful for

34:31.360 --> 34:36.640
 infants. Actually, I think you're timing on when you graduate is appropriate. They reference

34:36.640 --> 34:43.760
 the study back in the 90s, and the WHO does not recommend the plunger pull. So what does the

34:43.760 --> 34:49.360
 science say? I have to say, based on what we know, the need for aspiration prior to administering an

34:49.360 --> 34:55.600
 injection is dependent on certain factors. As a general rule, I'm going to say the science does

34:55.600 --> 35:01.760
 not support that you need to pull back on the plunger. And there's ample evidence suggesting

35:01.760 --> 35:07.520
 that. But what are the couple little caveats, right? It still is fairly standard. A lot of people do

35:07.520 --> 35:13.200
 this. Is there harm? Well, as mentioned in the pediatric population, the original teaching was

35:13.200 --> 35:18.160
 you held negative pressure for five seconds to make sure no blood would come up. That actually

35:18.160 --> 35:24.400
 creates pain. That is painful. It is delaying. Some of us that I think this is interesting.

35:24.400 --> 35:28.880
 What about epinephrine? You say, like, Oh, this is epinephrine. If I got that into a blood vessel,

35:28.880 --> 35:33.040
 my gosh, that that could be quite different than an I am injection of epinephrine.

35:33.040 --> 35:38.560
 Now let's all think about those epipeds, right? Those epipeds you basically put against your lateral

35:38.560 --> 35:43.200
 thigh, you push a button and boom, out comes the needle and out comes the medicine. Things are a

35:43.200 --> 35:48.960
 little different now, I have to say. I have seen people put injections in the deltoid bursa.

35:48.960 --> 35:56.160
 I have seen people completely miss the muscle and put it in the fat. Probably the pulling back

35:56.160 --> 36:01.280
 on the plunger is probably a small issue. What are the big issues getting that needle into the

36:01.280 --> 36:08.160
 muscle using a one inch needle? So you actually get through whatever subcutaneous tissue and into

36:08.160 --> 36:13.840
 it. If you're going to do IV, you definitely, well, I'm going to use the word, definitely.

36:13.840 --> 36:17.680
 You do want to make sure you're in the vessel because a lot of our medicines, if they're

36:17.680 --> 36:23.360
 infiltrating, can actually be caustic and cost tissue damage. But yeah, if you're going to put

36:23.360 --> 36:27.600
 it into a muscle and you know what you're doing and you're actually in the muscle,

36:27.600 --> 36:33.120
 do you really need to pull back? No. Is it better not to pull back? Yeah, probably actually,

36:33.120 --> 36:37.200
 I think best practice would be no. If you're going to give the shots in the deltoid,

36:37.200 --> 36:41.200
 put it in the deltoid, not in the bursa, not in the chubby part of the arm.

36:41.200 --> 36:47.600
 If you're thinking about doing a buttock shot, actually consider moving that to lateral thigh.

36:47.600 --> 36:51.840
 Well, you actually got a lot of emails about that and they were divided between,

36:52.400 --> 36:57.680
 we don't do it and we do it. It was very interesting. So it's one of those situations.

36:58.640 --> 37:02.080
 Well, let's come up, I think, Vincent, because the whole AstraZeneca issue.

37:02.640 --> 37:08.480
 And one of the theories they have there is that maybe, you know, younger people better,

37:08.480 --> 37:13.120
 you know, vascularized muscle. Maybe there are large enough vessels that you're getting it in

37:13.120 --> 37:18.800
 there. It's good to have the science and the current recommendations. We did so far this week,

37:18.800 --> 37:24.320
 213 vaccinations in my office. We're doing another 100 tomorrow afternoon into the evening.

37:25.600 --> 37:31.920
 Have I been pulled back on that plunger every time? No. Have I pulled back ever? No. So I'll

37:31.920 --> 37:41.680
 fast up. Okay. Deepa writes, I have been advised by my most excellent rheumatologist to skip two

37:41.680 --> 37:47.600
 doses of methotrexate after taking any vaccine, including the one for SARS-CoV-2 based on the

37:47.600 --> 37:51.760
 attached publication. This is the first study I'm aware of that carefully evaluated the immune

37:51.760 --> 37:57.440
 response to flu vaccine in RA patients. They randomized to two cohorts, one that skipped

37:57.440 --> 38:02.880
 two doses of methotrexate, one that did not. There is quite a remarkable and significant

38:02.880 --> 38:07.120
 difference in the antibody response elicited in favor of skipping methotrexate.

38:07.120 --> 38:12.160
 Key finding, methotrexate discontinuation for two weeks after vaccination significantly

38:12.160 --> 38:18.160
 increases immunogenicity of a seasonal influenza vaccine in patients with rheumatoid arthritis,

38:18.160 --> 38:23.360
 who had been on a stable dose of methotrexate without significantly altering,

38:23.360 --> 38:28.400
 increasing risk of disease activity. I hope this is helpful to you,

38:28.400 --> 38:33.040
 your patients and listeners of the podcast. Not many people are aware of this study.

38:33.040 --> 38:38.720
 We need more studies like this. No, this is great. So thank you. Actually,

38:38.720 --> 38:42.720
 Deepa, we do need more studies like this. And there's no reason that we can't be getting them,

38:42.720 --> 38:47.920
 right? We are currently vaccinating billions of people by the time we're done here.

38:47.920 --> 38:54.960
 And this is the time. And I know a lot of scientists have talked about, we need a rapid review,

38:54.960 --> 39:00.960
 rapid ability to fire up these studies. And if you think about it, right? These are studies

39:00.960 --> 39:07.120
 that are minimal harm. They're kind of observational studies. Rheumatologists, physicians who are

39:07.120 --> 39:12.640
 using these medications are trying to space these out. Some people sort of almost practice

39:12.640 --> 39:17.520
 preference might be only a week. Some people don't do this. Other people are getting this

39:17.520 --> 39:23.760
 two week. This is data. I think there would be very valuable in helping us just at immunizations

39:23.760 --> 39:29.840
 across the board, right? We do not only influenza vaccines, hopefully every year. But now we do

39:29.840 --> 39:34.800
 COVID vaccines. We have a lot of vaccines. So having really good science-based guidance here

39:34.800 --> 39:42.000
 would be tremendous. All right, one more from Mary Ann who writes, I got my first dose of Pfizer

39:42.000 --> 39:48.160
 March 23 at the time I signed up. Walgreens had a scheduled a second dose four weeks out.

39:48.160 --> 39:53.520
 And my next is scheduled 28 days. And she found out yesterday by the times that Walgreens had

39:53.520 --> 39:58.880
 taken upon themselves to schedule these second doses at their convenience, rather than at the

39:58.880 --> 40:06.560
 tested interval, which should be three weeks, 21 days. And Mary Ann goes on to expressing her

40:06.560 --> 40:13.760
 displeasure with Walgreens and wants to know any advice. Should I be looking at a booster

40:13.760 --> 40:18.480
 sooner than later? Should I ask my doctor for antibody testing? What can I do? I was looking

40:18.480 --> 40:23.440
 forward to getting out of my house again. Now I feel unsure. I figure I'll be wearing a mask

40:24.240 --> 40:33.760
 forever. Okay. So don't be so upset. Yeah, this was interesting, right? Walgreens decided that it

40:33.760 --> 40:41.040
 would be easier for them for their scheduling system to just do four weeks between shots and

40:41.040 --> 40:46.080
 just didn't care whether it was Pfizer or Baderda, which is interesting too, right? Because they're

40:46.080 --> 40:51.280
 shipping those second doses out and then they're sitting on a shelf somewhere for like an extra

40:51.280 --> 40:57.760
 week, right? Not in people's arms. And Walgreens was basically taken a task when this became public

40:57.760 --> 41:02.960
 and told that that that is not what we recommend. You need to be giving those second doses,

41:02.960 --> 41:08.080
 you know, 21 days or sort of four side, four days either side of those 21 days,

41:08.080 --> 41:13.120
 not waiting till 28 days, unless, you know, as we say, extraordinary circumstances.

41:14.160 --> 41:19.600
 So, you know, go ahead, get that second dose when you can get it. Do I think scientifically,

41:19.600 --> 41:24.320
 it makes a difference whether you're getting it at 21 days or 28, you know, in a lot of ways,

41:24.320 --> 41:30.800
 I compare Moderna and Pfizer to Coca-Cola in a CAD versus Coca-Cola in a bottle. You're getting

41:30.800 --> 41:37.520
 the same mRNA. The packaging is a little bit different. You know, the size is a little bit

41:37.520 --> 41:42.480
 different. But the outcome, it's going to quench your thirst. It's going to protect you from COVID

41:42.480 --> 41:49.360
 quite well. So yeah, don't feel like Walgreens creating this difficulty is going to mean that

41:49.360 --> 41:54.080
 you're going to be less protected at the end of the day. So Marianne says, thank you and the

41:54.080 --> 41:58.880
 whole Twif team for being a calm place to find accurate information. You guys get an A plus plus,

41:58.880 --> 42:09.040
 Walgreens gets an F minus. Okay. And on that note, that is COVID-19 clinical update number 57

42:09.040 --> 42:29.360
 with Dr. Daniel Griffin. Thank you, Daniel. All right. Thank you so much. And everyone, be safe.
