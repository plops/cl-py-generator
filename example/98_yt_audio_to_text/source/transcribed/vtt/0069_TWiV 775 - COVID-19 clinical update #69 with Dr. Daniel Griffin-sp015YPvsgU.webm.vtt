00:00.000 --> 00:06.880
 This week in virology, the podcast about viruses, the kind that make you sick.

00:10.080 --> 00:20.640
 From MicrobeTV, this is Twiv, this week in virology, Episode 775, recorded on July 1st, 2021.

00:21.200 --> 00:26.960
 I'm Vincent Racken Yello, and you're listening to the podcast all about viruses. Joining me

00:26.960 --> 00:34.720
 today from New York, Daniel Griffin. Hello, everyone. So Daniel, President Biden said,

00:34.720 --> 00:41.040
 by July 4th, we'd have 70% of the US immunized. Has that been achieved?

00:41.680 --> 00:48.560
 No, we're not quite there. We're falling a little short. And it's regional. We're falling short

00:48.560 --> 00:54.000
 in different regions and kind of look at a map. And you can see where those regions are. And you

00:54.000 --> 01:02.240
 really just look at the incidence of COVID-19. And you know those areas with low vaccination uptake.

01:03.200 --> 01:09.040
 So yeah, we didn't quite hit there. I mean, we're doing, we're doing decent. You know, could be worse.

01:10.480 --> 01:14.320
 So you worse could be better, right? It could definitely be better. I'm sorry that it's not

01:14.320 --> 01:22.320
 better. Yeah, I mean, I, I had a woman I saw just yesterday, you know, Haitian to sad,

01:22.320 --> 01:29.120
 had moved to the United States when she was younger. And she ended up in the ER. And I was

01:29.120 --> 01:33.520
 talking to her a little bit about why she had not gotten vaccinated. And you know, there's a lot

01:33.520 --> 01:40.640
 of this misinformation. She had been told that there was bad stuff in the vaccines. And in in

01:40.640 --> 01:47.360
 15 years, we would all be dead. So it's hard to fight against that because apparently we have to

01:47.360 --> 01:54.000
 wait 15 years to see. But no, I mean, you know, here's a woman who's sick. And I think we talked

01:54.000 --> 02:01.840
 about my partner's sister-in-law who died leaving behind children. Yeah, I mean, they're, unfortunately,

02:01.840 --> 02:08.960
 this misinformation is not innocent. It, it results in people getting sick, people dying. So so a lot

02:08.960 --> 02:13.680
 has happened this week. I have to say, so Vincent and I, and to our listeners, I, you know, right

02:13.680 --> 02:19.200
 after I record one episode, I start taking notes for the next one. I see an interesting article that

02:19.200 --> 02:23.920
 came out. Sometimes I get to the end of the article and I realize I don't like that, delete that.

02:23.920 --> 02:29.840
 Something more interesting comes up. And I keep thinking, boy, eventually like the firehose of

02:29.840 --> 02:35.600
 information will settle down and we'll go to this month in clinical updates, but there just seems

02:35.600 --> 02:43.840
 there's so much information. So let's jump right into it. My quotation, courage is not the absence

02:43.840 --> 02:50.240
 of fear, but rather the assessment that something else is more important than fear. And actually,

02:50.240 --> 02:57.680
 Peter Hotez tweeted that out. That's FDR. And I think he tweeted it out. You know, my sort of

02:57.680 --> 03:04.640
 heart and sympathy goes down to so many science educators, like yourself, Vincent, like Peter,

03:04.640 --> 03:12.480
 who are just trying to to spread knowledge to educate. And there's really a bit of a backlash,

03:12.480 --> 03:19.280
 which is more than vile at times. So I know this is really tough. So I applaud the courage of all

03:19.280 --> 03:27.200
 the people that continue to to educate despite that backlash. I will say before I get into my

03:27.200 --> 03:35.280
 episode, I really love the tweet of episode 773 with Lori Garrett. Certainly no shrinking

03:35.280 --> 03:41.600
 violet brought lots of passion. I love her books. So, you know, it's summertime, right? People go

03:41.600 --> 03:46.880
 to the beach. They read books. They go to the lake. They have some time sitting on the back porch.

03:47.600 --> 03:51.840
 These, these are great, great books and very, very timely while written.

03:51.840 --> 03:59.280
 All right. So let me start. And I'm actually going to touch on a few controversial topics.

04:00.080 --> 04:06.480
 This week, there was a guest essay. Human behavior during the pandemic is more important than any

04:06.480 --> 04:13.040
 COVID variant. And I don't know if people ran across this, but this was written by a Dr.

04:13.040 --> 04:20.400
 Rosenfeld and a Dr. Rachin Yellow. Yes. Same Amy and Vincent that our listeners might know.

04:20.400 --> 04:27.040
 And the article really does an excellent job of making the point that I'll be touching on today.

04:28.000 --> 04:33.920
 So ultimately, a virus has a genetic sequence that changes. And these changes can, they can be

04:33.920 --> 04:41.600
 neutral. They can be favorable. They're usually unfavorable in terms of viral fitness. And this

04:41.600 --> 04:48.960
 is my sort of request to the audience and the media to start using the word fitness, rather than

04:48.960 --> 04:56.640
 transmissibility. And this viral fitness is really the same Darwinian concept that underlies the

04:56.640 --> 05:01.200
 whole survival of the fittest that many of us learned about if we were allowed to be taught

05:01.200 --> 05:08.960
 that in our schools. And reproduction is a chance for an organism to end up with improved fitness.

05:08.960 --> 05:15.120
 And we have certainly given SARS-CoV-2 the opportunity to reproduce. And it's not surprising

05:15.120 --> 05:21.840
 that we are seeing that the delta variant, that there's evidence to suggest that it has

05:21.840 --> 05:26.320
 improved fitness, that it's going to have the ability to out-compete other viruses.

05:27.200 --> 05:32.880
 And I know I drive some of even the other ID docs a little bit crazy in, you know, sort of focus

05:32.880 --> 05:39.200
 on, let's say, things that are true. Let's use the right terminology. But I'm going to push on

05:39.200 --> 05:44.400
 that and let's just spend a little time here before I get into other sort of bits in the literature.

05:44.400 --> 05:49.840
 But take some time and read that article. Vincent hopefully will post it up on the

05:49.840 --> 05:55.440
 Parasites Without Borders website. But let's sort of go through this together. What factors can

05:55.440 --> 06:02.800
 improve a virus's or a variance fitness? What changes would be favorable? And I'm going to try

06:02.800 --> 06:08.480
 to avoid anthropomorphism. And I think I'm going to succeed. So everyone can listen and comment

06:08.480 --> 06:16.560
 if they catch me. But a virus can change in a way that increases the duration of viral shedding,

06:16.560 --> 06:21.680
 right? So a person could perhaps shed virus for a longer period of time before they became

06:22.240 --> 06:28.560
 symptomatic or before they become symptomatic. Maybe they can continue to shed viable infectious

06:28.560 --> 06:34.800
 virus for a longer period post symptom onset. And this might involve some changes that impact

06:34.800 --> 06:40.800
 the interaction with the immune system. A virus can mutate in a way that increases the level

06:41.360 --> 06:47.760
 of this infectious virus shedding. A person could perhaps shed virus at a higher level, right? And

06:47.760 --> 06:53.040
 we've talked about CT values. Even more than that, we've talked about how you don't just need a lot

06:53.040 --> 06:59.600
 of RNA, but you actually need viable virus. So a little harder to look at that. A virus could change

06:59.600 --> 07:06.160
 in a way that allows for infection of the next host with a lower inoculum, right? And people have

07:06.160 --> 07:12.720
 talked about maybe improved affinity to the receptor. So lower inoculum resulting in infection.

07:13.680 --> 07:19.360
 A virus can change in a way that modifies its tropism for lower down in the airways,

07:19.360 --> 07:23.360
 potentially increasing the degree to which it's contained in smaller droplets that's been

07:23.360 --> 07:29.360
 discussed on a prior Twiv. Or maybe it can modify its tropism to start involving more of the

07:29.360 --> 07:36.720
 upper airways. More runny, drippy noses, maybe more sneezing. A virus can change in a way.

07:37.600 --> 07:43.520
 And I'm going to sort of focus on this, where it can allow it to re-infect previously infected

07:43.520 --> 07:48.960
 people. People that thought they had natural protection, maybe had natural protection against

07:48.960 --> 07:55.760
 one of the early variants. But perhaps now changes. Maybe that sweet spot in the receptor

07:55.760 --> 08:01.520
 body domain changes enough that those natural antibodies no longer target as well. Maybe the

08:01.520 --> 08:08.640
 T cells aren't up to the challenge. Or a virus might change in a certain way that decreases its

08:08.640 --> 08:18.160
 susceptibility to antiviral medications or vaccination. So I think that these are all reasonable.

08:19.600 --> 08:24.800
 And I think that I'm going to sort of keep asking people. And I think it's for the media,

08:24.800 --> 08:31.520
 right? The virus is becoming more fit. We have a fitness increase in the variants.

08:31.520 --> 08:34.800
 I think that's exciting. People can read that, I think.

08:36.400 --> 08:41.520
 Now, we do have concerns with the Delta variant that in addition to re-infecting the previously

08:41.520 --> 08:46.160
 infected, there's evidence, such as the report from Scotland that I discussed last time,

08:46.800 --> 08:51.280
 that the Delta variant may be associated with an increased risk of hospitalization,

08:51.280 --> 08:58.240
 death, and seems to be infecting younger individuals. So let's just go through a few of these. But

08:58.240 --> 09:05.840
 what I'm going to do is jump to the escape from vaccines and therapeutics. Let's get some science

09:05.840 --> 09:11.760
 here. So I'm just not another person with two thumbs and an opinion. So we got new information

09:11.760 --> 09:18.480
 from Moderna in the form of the press release. Moderna provides a clinical update on the neutralizing

09:18.480 --> 09:25.760
 activity of its COVID-19 vaccine on emerging variants, including the Delta variant first identified in

09:25.760 --> 09:30.800
 India. But they also released the data as a preprint. So let's jump to the preprint,

09:30.800 --> 09:39.520
 right to the preprint serum neutralizing activity of mRNA 1273 against SARS-CoV-2 variants, right?

09:39.520 --> 09:46.480
 So this is the Moderna vaccine. The authors reported that Sira from participants immunized

09:46.480 --> 09:51.360
 on a prime boost schedule, right? So first shot, then you four weeks later with Moderna get the

09:51.360 --> 10:00.800
 second shot, had neutralizing activity against several SARS-CoV-2 variants, including variants of

10:00.800 --> 10:11.280
 concern and variants of interest. And this was compared to the D614G. So the wild type SARS-CoV-2

10:11.280 --> 10:17.280
 as a referent. They showed that there were minimal effects on neutralization against, and I'm going

10:17.280 --> 10:22.960
 to, we're going to go with the Greek here against the alpha variant, only a 1.2-fold reduction.

10:23.600 --> 10:32.560
 The other VOCs, they looked at beta, gamma, delta, and you saw between a 2.1 and an 8-4-fold

10:32.560 --> 10:39.120
 reduction. So what they were describing as small reduction, but little detail here.

10:39.120 --> 10:46.400
 The participants were immunized. The Sira was collected seven days post-boost. They only

10:46.400 --> 10:52.000
 analyzed eight participants. And these assays were done using pseudovirus,

10:52.720 --> 10:57.600
 not real stuff in a BSL-3. So just to put that in context.

10:59.280 --> 11:05.280
 What about other vaccines, comparison? We have data from the UK suggesting that the Pfizer

11:05.280 --> 11:11.760
 BioNTech vaccine was 88% effective against symptomatic disease from the delta variant

11:11.760 --> 11:17.120
 two weeks after the second dose, compared to 93% effective against the alpha variant.

11:18.000 --> 11:23.600
 Two doses of the AstraZeneca, not as impressive, 60% effective against symptomatic disease

11:24.240 --> 11:30.400
 from the delta variant compared to 66% compared to the alpha variant.

11:30.400 --> 11:37.840
 Both vaccines. I think people may know this. We're only about 33% effective after just one dose,

11:38.560 --> 11:45.840
 which is where many of us peg natural infection. The J&J efficacy is largely unknown. So I know

11:45.840 --> 11:51.040
 I get a lot of questions here. Like now that we have the delta variant, what's the role of J&J?

11:52.320 --> 11:58.000
 I have to say here in the US, we're very fortunate. The vast majority of our vaccination campaign

11:58.000 --> 12:06.080
 has utilized the mRNA, the Moderna, and the Pfizer vaccines. And we're seeing the real world data

12:06.080 --> 12:10.320
 from Pfizer BioNTech. Now we're getting a little more data on Moderna as well.

12:12.080 --> 12:15.440
 All right, children, COVID, and mental health. I'm going to lump it all in there.

12:16.320 --> 12:22.480
 As I like to say, children at low risk, but they are not at no risk. I had a great conversation.

12:22.480 --> 12:29.200
 It was actually yesterday with Dr. Melissa Stockwell. She's one of the few experts in pediatric

12:29.200 --> 12:34.960
 COVID. And she's right there, right here at Columbia University Medical Center.

12:35.760 --> 12:41.360
 And it was really an interesting conversation we had. I've been working at the United Health

12:41.360 --> 12:47.440
 Group level to try to identify referral centers for individuals with difficulty. And one of the

12:47.440 --> 12:53.200
 biggest challenges is finding centers that have experience and a focus on children.

12:53.840 --> 13:00.880
 So we were discussing a bit of her experience with regarding long COVID in children. And her

13:00.880 --> 13:06.080
 suggestion was that we may have underestimated how much long COVID is impacting children.

13:06.800 --> 13:13.040
 And she says she's starting to see in the recent few weeks here, as the children leave school,

13:13.040 --> 13:18.720
 try to get out there and exercise and get involved in activities. A lot more parents are noticing

13:18.720 --> 13:25.520
 that their children are struggling. We had a little conversation, how much of that is post-acute

13:25.520 --> 13:35.360
 sequelae of COVID versus post-acute sequelae of a pandemic. So there'll be more on this as we go

13:35.360 --> 13:40.640
 forward. But just to keep this in mind, a lot of these younger individuals still do not have the

13:40.640 --> 13:45.920
 opportunity to get vaccinated and certain parts of our country still have actually

13:46.720 --> 13:53.600
 unacceptably high infection rates. As I mentioned, mental health, the pandemic has had a significant

13:53.600 --> 14:01.200
 impact on mental health. I discussed the issue in adolescent girls, actually, a significant

14:01.200 --> 14:09.040
 increase in them ending up in the emergency room. But we had an MMR early release from the CDC,

14:09.040 --> 14:16.800
 symptoms of depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, and suicidal ideation among

14:16.800 --> 14:22.720
 state, tribal, local, and territorial public health workers during the COVID-19 pandemic,

14:22.720 --> 14:32.320
 the United States marched through April of 2021. Now, the authors reported they looked at 26,174

14:32.320 --> 14:39.120
 public health workers, 53 percent reported symptoms at least one mental health condition

14:39.680 --> 14:45.680
 in the two weeks prior to the survey. Symptoms were most prevalent among those who were unable to

14:45.680 --> 14:53.200
 take time off or who were working greater than or equal to 41 hours per week. So the majority of

14:53.200 --> 14:59.280
 public health workers surveyed were reporting mental health issues. The reported symptoms of

14:59.280 --> 15:10.080
 depression, 32 percent, anxiety, 30 percent, PTSD, 37 percent, suicidal ideation was as high as 8.4 percent.

15:11.120 --> 15:17.600
 The highest prevalence of a mental health condition was among respondents aged less than or equal

15:17.600 --> 15:25.840
 to 29 and among transgender and non-binary persons of all ages. The authors do comment

15:25.840 --> 15:32.640
 that the findings of this report have certain limitations. I thought the most important that

15:32.640 --> 15:37.040
 they mentioned was that the participants were surveyed only about symptoms experienced in the

15:37.040 --> 15:42.240
 two weeks preceding the survey. So it doesn't reflect all the stress and all the difficulties

15:42.240 --> 15:48.880
 over the last 18 months, sort of a snapshot here, but an incredibly troubling snapshot.

15:48.880 --> 15:56.320
 And I think this reinforces what we're seeing all across the healthcare sector. We're seeing

15:56.320 --> 16:02.160
 individuals struggling with mental health challenges due to stress, financial insecurity,

16:03.120 --> 16:09.120
 loss. I mean, a lot of people have lost loved ones, jobs, other things. And I really appreciated

16:09.120 --> 16:15.120
 a piece by my friend Lucy McBride published in The Atlantic. I need to subscribe. By now,

16:15.120 --> 16:20.080
 burnout is a given. Just discussing how we're seeing this in so many healthcare providers,

16:20.080 --> 16:26.640
 but we're no special class. We're seeing this all across our society. So mental health is health.

16:28.080 --> 16:33.520
 All right. I would like to say testing never miss an opportunity to test. We still need to

16:33.520 --> 16:39.760
 keep doing testing. And particularly with the suggestion that we may now see presentations

16:39.760 --> 16:46.240
 that are less typical than we're used to at individual today who went to an urgent care center

16:46.240 --> 16:51.600
 with a chief complaint of, I think I have sinusitis. I'm feeling all this fullness in my sinuses,

16:52.720 --> 17:00.000
 tested positive for COVID ended up in the emergency room. We confirmed that that was COVID. This

17:00.000 --> 17:06.080
 gentleman is now hypoxic in the hospital. And really the presentation was sinusitis,

17:06.080 --> 17:13.760
 which quickly then evolved into hypoxemia and pulmonary involvement. All right, active vaccination

17:14.560 --> 17:19.280
 never miss an opportunity to vaccinate. And vaccination is how this pandemic ends.

17:20.080 --> 17:26.720
 Lots here this week. The article correlates of protection against symptomatic and asymptomatic

17:26.720 --> 17:33.440
 SARS COVID-2 infection was posted as a preprint by a number of authors and the Oxford COVID

17:33.440 --> 17:41.920
 vaccine trial group. So data from a randomized efficacy trial of the Chadox AstraZeneca vaccine

17:42.560 --> 17:47.840
 in the UK were analyzed to determine the antibody levels associated with protection against SARS

17:47.840 --> 17:54.720
 COVID-2. So drumroll here, we all want to know this. Can I get a blood test? Can I find out?

17:54.720 --> 18:01.120
 Am I protected? So they looked at any spike in anti-receptor binding domain IgG

18:01.120 --> 18:07.440
 by multiplex amino assay. They used pseudovirus and live neutralizing, like that used the word

18:07.440 --> 18:14.240
 live in this virology paper. I should say active neutralizing antibody at 28 days after the second

18:14.240 --> 18:21.520
 dose. And they looked at infected, non-infected vaccine recipients. And they reported that higher

18:21.520 --> 18:28.960
 levels of all immune markers correlated with a reduced risk of symptomatic infection. But

18:28.960 --> 18:35.760
 antibody responses did not correlate with overall protection against asymptomatic infection.

18:36.560 --> 18:43.360
 So the authors reported that they had data for anti-spike and anti-receptor binding domain IgG

18:43.360 --> 18:55.440
 from 1,318 individuals. They had 163 cases, 1,155 non-cases. Interesting, but still very

18:55.440 --> 19:01.360
 preliminary. I'm not sure we have all the answers. This data is only for the AstraZeneca vaccine.

19:02.000 --> 19:08.640
 It only looked at responses, any predominantly Caucasian population in the UK, when only the

19:08.640 --> 19:14.320
 alpha variant was circulating. And as noted, no correlation was seen with higher levels of

19:14.320 --> 19:20.880
 antibody and protection against asymptomatic infection. And we do know that we can get

19:20.880 --> 19:28.560
 transmission with asymptomatic infection. Now people that unfortunately have to tolerate

19:28.560 --> 19:34.720
 me in person on a regular basis have probably grown tired of. I always find a way to insert

19:34.720 --> 19:41.360
 the word heterogenous into conversations, one of my favorite words. But now we now have a study

19:41.360 --> 19:49.920
 published in the Lancet about heterogenous vaccinations, mix and max, max, mix and max. See,

19:49.920 --> 19:57.840
 heterogenous, so much easier to say. Immunogenicity and reactogenicity of BNT162B2 booster

19:57.840 --> 20:04.880
 in Chadox primed participants, CombiVacS, a multi-center open label randomized controlled

20:04.880 --> 20:13.200
 phase two trial. So the authors reported on this randomized control trial on adults aged 18 to 60

20:13.200 --> 20:18.640
 vaccinated with a single dose of the Chadox AstraZeneca vaccine, eight to 12 weeks before

20:18.640 --> 20:25.120
 screening, no history of prior infection. And then the participants were randomly assigned to either

20:25.120 --> 20:33.440
 get the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine via a single intramuscular injection, or just to continue

20:33.440 --> 20:40.080
 observation, a control group. And the primary outcome was 14-day immunogenicity measured

20:40.080 --> 20:47.120
 by immunoassays for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and receptor binding domain. So here again,

20:47.120 --> 20:51.920
 we're measuring antibody levels, right? We just got a little bit of sense that maybe there's some

20:51.920 --> 21:00.160
 correlation we might have there. So 676 individuals were enrolled, randomly assigned to either intervention

21:00.160 --> 21:06.560
 at five university hospitals in Spain's was done in Spain. In the intervention group,

21:06.560 --> 21:18.880
 the receptor binding domain antibodies increased from 7.46 up to 7,756. As far as the IgG against

21:18.880 --> 21:29.600
 trimeric spike protein, this increased from 98.4 to 3,684.87. Reactions were mild to moderate

21:29.600 --> 21:38.480
 some injection site pain, not infection, injection site pain, some induration. About 44% of the

21:38.480 --> 21:46.480
 people said they developed a headache. About 43% felt the muscle aches, no serious adverse

21:46.480 --> 21:54.320
 events. But basically, they were showing that we were seeing a significant rise in antibody levels

21:54.320 --> 22:00.880
 using this mix and match or heterogeneous vaccine approach. And I know we get a lot of questions

22:00.880 --> 22:07.680
 because in certain parts of the world, AstraZeneca was rolled out and then they pulled it back and

22:07.680 --> 22:14.480
 then people are getting other vaccines. What I don't know if I can comment on here is this is

22:14.480 --> 22:19.280
 just getting one dose of the mRNA vaccine. The current recommendation is still, let's say you

22:19.280 --> 22:25.600
 come to the US and you've only had one AstraZeneca vaccine, we recommend just restarting and doing

22:25.600 --> 22:31.280
 two shots of the mRNA. So this is the kind of data that might factor into those recommendations.

22:33.360 --> 22:42.400
 All right, now if a person had COVID-19 previously, should they get one or two doses of a two dose

22:42.400 --> 22:50.080
 vaccine? Certainly controversial. The report prior SARS-CoV-2 infection rescues B and T cell

22:50.080 --> 22:56.720
 responses to variants after first vaccine dose was published in science. And we've been hearing a

22:56.720 --> 23:01.680
 lot about this issue. And it may be helpful in many areas of the world that already have

23:01.680 --> 23:07.680
 significant number of prior infections, more limited numbers of available vaccine doses

23:07.680 --> 23:13.920
 to sort of know, can we take people who had COVID before and just give them one vaccine? Do we need

23:13.920 --> 23:20.400
 to use two twice the resources? The authors analyzed T and B cell responses after first dose

23:20.400 --> 23:27.360
 vaccination with the Pfizer, BioNTech mRNA vaccine in healthcare workers. They followed

23:27.360 --> 23:35.280
 them longitudinally. These were people that had previous infection. After one dose, individuals

23:35.280 --> 23:41.520
 with prior infection showed enhanced T cell immunity, antibodies secreting memory B cell response,

23:42.240 --> 23:50.240
 and neutralizing antibodies against the variants. I think that all this is interesting. And to be

23:50.240 --> 23:56.480
 honest, does build on what we know. This is actually, I'll say a rather dense, interesting paper,

23:57.040 --> 24:02.640
 perhaps on immune or some immunologist will do a deeper dive into this. But I'm not sure this is

24:02.640 --> 24:09.120
 so far or at the point where this is practice changing information, but we are learning more.

24:11.120 --> 24:16.480
 This may also impact that WHO has forecast that certain vulnerable high risk individuals

24:16.480 --> 24:23.600
 may need yearly COVID shots vaccines. There won't be COVID in the shots. There will be vaccine in

24:23.600 --> 24:28.720
 those shots. You know, if richer countries feel they need boosters for some of their citizens,

24:28.720 --> 24:34.080
 then this, again, will affect equity issue. I do want to remind all the listeners how effective

24:34.080 --> 24:39.360
 these vaccines are, even in people with negative serology tests. I want people to everyone to run

24:39.360 --> 24:45.600
 out and get those serology tests. In the last month, there have been more than 18,000 deaths

24:45.600 --> 24:51.200
 from COVID here in the U.S. And over 99% of those were in unvaccinated individuals.

24:52.320 --> 24:56.720
 All right. In the New England Journal of Medicine, we saw effect of vaccination

24:56.720 --> 25:02.960
 on household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in England. And this is really, I think,

25:02.960 --> 25:07.520
 addresses the critical issue. People come up all the time. If I've been vaccinated,

25:07.520 --> 25:15.680
 can I transmit the virus to other people? This really is critical because the whole concept of

25:15.680 --> 25:22.880
 community immunity relies on vaccines interrupting transmission. And this is that question,

25:22.880 --> 25:28.080
 is there free lunch for the unvaccinated? So the authors analyzed data from the household

25:28.080 --> 25:34.480
 transmission evaluation data set hosted, which is information on all laboratory confirmed cases

25:34.480 --> 25:41.360
 of COVID-19 in England. As you can imagine, it's a very large data set. So between January 4th,

25:41.360 --> 25:51.760
 February 28th, 2021, there were 960,765 household contacts of unvaccinated index patients,

25:51.760 --> 25:59.600
 and there were 96,898 secondary cases of COVID-19. The authors compared the risk of secondary

25:59.600 --> 26:05.840
 infection defined as a positive SARS-CoV-2 test two to 14 days after the positive test for the

26:05.840 --> 26:13.600
 index case among unvaccinated household contexts of vaccinated persons with the risk among unvaccinated

26:13.600 --> 26:18.880
 household contexts of unvaccinated persons with infection. And they reported, drumroll,

26:18.880 --> 26:25.600
 that vaccination was associated with a 40 to 50% reduction in transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

26:26.400 --> 26:35.440
 Now, there's a couple things I will say there. One is they are through their contact tracing,

26:35.440 --> 26:42.880
 confirming that vaccinated people who get infected can still transmit it to other individuals.

26:42.880 --> 26:49.040
 I was a little underwhelmed, I guess 40 to 50% reduction in transmission. I had hoped

26:49.040 --> 26:54.880
 for better. That is not as much as I would like. But remember, this is only the second step in

26:54.880 --> 27:00.480
 the process. The first step in the process is a vaccinated person has to get infected. And we

27:00.480 --> 27:07.040
 already have, well, good information on symptomatic infection. We're getting better information as

27:07.040 --> 27:13.200
 time goes by on the decrease impact of any asymptomatic infection. But just to keep in mind,

27:13.200 --> 27:20.080
 a vaccinated person is not 100% safe. If they get infected with SARS-CoV-2, they are less likely,

27:20.080 --> 27:27.040
 but not zero. All right. Now, the next question I get all the time, how long will my vaccine

27:27.040 --> 27:34.240
 induced immunity protect me? Will I need a booster shot? And the article SARS-CoV-2,

27:34.240 --> 27:41.440
 mRNA vaccines induce persistent human germinal center responses, was published in nature.

27:42.240 --> 27:49.200
 And again, this is a rather deep, complex article. The flow cytometry for all the immunologists in

27:49.200 --> 27:54.400
 the audience are very nice. I'm sure they had to do a lot of flow cytometry to get such nice

27:54.400 --> 28:00.960
 flow plots. But what the researchers did here is they examined fine needle aspirates. Explain

28:00.960 --> 28:06.320
 what that is. You take a small needle and you actually put it into a lymph node, and then you

28:06.320 --> 28:13.040
 draw back on a syringe, you're actually obtaining cells. They did this from 14 individuals from the

28:13.040 --> 28:18.480
 draining axillary lymph nodes. So you can think about you're getting your vaccine in your deltoid,

28:18.480 --> 28:23.680
 in your arm, and then they're checking the lymph nodes under the arm, in the armpit.

28:23.680 --> 28:30.640
 They identified germinal center B cells that bound S protein in all participants sampled

28:30.640 --> 28:37.440
 after primary immunization. They reported that high frequency of S binding germinal center B

28:37.440 --> 28:44.080
 cells and plasma blast were sustained in these draining lymph nodes for at least 12 weeks after

28:44.080 --> 28:50.480
 the booster immunization. And they suggested that these findings supported the idea that SARS-CoV-2

28:50.480 --> 28:56.560
 mRNA based vaccination of humans might induce a persistent germinal center B cell response,

28:56.560 --> 29:01.440
 enabling the generation of robust umeral immunity that might be rather durable.

29:02.160 --> 29:08.000
 So this is interesting. It's a cause for optimism. But we still need some more data to before we

29:08.000 --> 29:14.480
 hang our hat on this. Now this, this was kind of a late one coming in, but I think exciting.

29:14.480 --> 29:23.440
 Um, we saw the New England Journal medicine publication safety and efficacy of NVX COV-2373

29:23.440 --> 29:31.280
 COVID-19 vaccine. Um, that's the Nova Vax, the protein based vaccine. The, as I've liked to say,

29:31.280 --> 29:36.720
 the honest traditional vaccine that we've been using for many years for for shingles vaccination,

29:36.720 --> 29:43.120
 shingrix, pertussis hepatitis B. And here in the New England Journal of Medicine, we saw the

29:43.120 --> 29:50.800
 peer-reviewed publication of the Phase 3 randomized observer-blinded placebo control trial conducted

29:50.800 --> 30:00.080
 at 33 sites in the UK. Um, individuals, adults ages 18 to 84 in a one-to-one ratio to receive

30:00.080 --> 30:09.680
 two intramuscular immunizations or placebo administered 21 days apart. The primary efficacy

30:09.680 --> 30:16.960
 endpoint was biologically confirmed mild, moderate or severe COV-2, SARS-CoV-2 infection,

30:16.960 --> 30:23.680
 with an onset of at least seven days after that second injection, um, in participants who were

30:23.680 --> 30:28.080
 serologically negative at baseline, right? So these are people that had not been infected,

30:28.080 --> 30:36.640
 were immunized. Um, the two-dose, um, Nova Vax vaccine, um, conferred 89.7% protection,

30:36.640 --> 30:43.120
 against SARS-CoV-2 infection, and, um, showed high efficacy against the alpha variant. Uh,

30:43.120 --> 30:48.880
 the incidence of serious adverse events was low. And actually, I thought this was interesting. Um,

30:48.880 --> 30:53.520
 it was very hard for individuals to be able to tell whether or not they were in the placebo

30:53.520 --> 30:59.200
 or the vaccine group. So this has a lot less of that reactogenicity, um, that we've grown

30:59.200 --> 31:06.560
 accustomed to. Um, we hear rumors that Nova Vax is going to be, um, putting this forward to the FDA,

31:06.560 --> 31:11.760
 this quarter, sort of the corporate approach to the world. So this quarter will be, I guess,

31:11.760 --> 31:17.760
 July, August, September. Um, so this will be an exciting, um, addition. Um, and, and I think it,

31:17.760 --> 31:22.480
 it will make a difference. There's a lot of individuals that I talked to that are waiting

31:22.480 --> 31:27.440
 for this vaccine. Um, so I think if we can give people options and that option then,

31:27.440 --> 31:33.440
 um, ends up with them vaccinated. Um, I'm all for choices. The time, the period of detectable

31:33.440 --> 31:38.880
 viral replication, right? That first week that viral symptom phase, the time for monitoring

31:38.880 --> 31:43.440
 and monoclonals. And as I like to say, where you get your test is where you should be able to get

31:43.440 --> 31:50.880
 your monoclonals. Um, U S health officials on Friday, February 25th, pause the distribution

31:50.880 --> 31:58.640
 of Eli Lilly's COVID 1980 body cocktail therapy, um, with concerns about a lack of effectiveness

31:58.640 --> 32:05.600
 against the beta and gamma corona variants. Um, the FDA recommended use of the Regeneron

32:05.600 --> 32:13.680
 cocktail, um, and the, via GSK therapy instead of this combination therapy. Um, all of the

32:13.680 --> 32:19.680
 assays to date would suggest that those other monoclonal therapies, um, continue to be effective.

32:19.680 --> 32:25.760
 Um, just some sort of real world. Um, the government has purchased a lot of the Regeneron cocktails.

32:25.760 --> 32:30.160
 They're sort of out there sitting on shelves. Um, I have not seen much uptake with the

32:30.160 --> 32:35.600
 via GSK yet. Um, and I'm still waiting to find out will the government purchase that? Um,

32:35.600 --> 32:39.920
 will that be something that health insurance companies are expected to reimburse? What are

32:39.920 --> 32:47.440
 the on the ground issue differences? Um, Regeneron is frozen, must be thawed. Um, you can do IV,

32:47.440 --> 32:52.880
 or as we now know, sub queue with four injections. Um, and then there's a two hour observation

32:52.880 --> 32:58.560
 period. Uh, the via GSK can be in the fridge. Um, it can be a 30 minute infusion with a one

32:58.560 --> 33:03.840
 hour wait time. So may have a certain role in that doctor's office that busy urgent care.

33:04.880 --> 33:10.240
 And since a lot of people have decided, um, not to get vaccinated, uh, there will continue

33:10.240 --> 33:16.320
 to be a first week of COVID. All right. Early inflammatory phase, right? These are those

33:16.320 --> 33:22.960
 individuals. The oxygen saturation drops below 94%. Uh, they end up in the hospital. We have steroids.

33:22.960 --> 33:29.680
 We have oxygen. We have remdesivir. Um, monoclonals, right? If they're anybody, um, is still negative,

33:29.680 --> 33:35.280
 the data we talked about from, uh, the Regeneron cocktail. June 24th, the FDA announced that they

33:35.280 --> 33:42.480
 had issued an emergency use authorization and EUA for the drug tosyllism app, uh, for the

33:42.480 --> 33:48.800
 treatment of hospitalized adults and patients, um, who are receiving steroids, um, require

33:48.800 --> 33:55.920
 supplemental oxygen, um, but then progress. Um, this data supported the data supporting this, uh,

33:55.920 --> 34:01.760
 EUA, uh, was based on four clinical trials. Um, and we've talked about, I think most of these,

34:01.760 --> 34:08.000
 they included one randomized controlled open label platform trial, uh, that was recovery,

34:08.000 --> 34:15.600
 three randomized double blind placebo controlled trials, impacta, covecta, and remdacta.

34:15.600 --> 34:20.400
 While all the four clinical trials contributed, um, the most important as far as numbers,

34:20.400 --> 34:26.320
 potential benefit came from the recovery and the impacta trial. So just to remind people, um,

34:26.320 --> 34:31.840
 of those trials, um, but to put this in, in context, person ends up in the hospital.

34:31.840 --> 34:36.960
 You've started remdesivir. You're supporting them with oxygen. You've started steroids.

34:36.960 --> 34:41.760
 Their oxygen requirement increases. That's where you think about tosyllism app.

34:42.320 --> 34:47.360
 The recovery trial was the trial that looked at over 4,000 hospitalized patients, uh,

34:47.360 --> 34:53.840
 with severe, um, COVID-19. Um, and this study demonstrated a statistically significant reduction

34:53.840 --> 35:02.880
 in risk of death and time in the hospital. Um, the impacta trial, a smaller trial, 389 hospitalized

35:02.880 --> 35:11.120
 patients, um, also demonstrated, um, benefit, uh, a decreased risk for ending up on a ventilator

35:11.120 --> 35:17.360
 and also a decreased risk of death. Um, but to reinforce timing really matters,

35:17.360 --> 35:22.880
 the benefit is only seen in those patients with an elevated inflammatory markers that

35:22.880 --> 35:27.840
 progressed to higher oxygen requirements despite steroids. Um, and there's a time window. You

35:27.840 --> 35:33.200
 want to give this, um, less than 48 hours after they escalate. If they escalate, they're on a

35:33.200 --> 35:38.800
 ventilator. You wait till day three. Um, you may just be, um, increasing their, their risk of

35:38.800 --> 35:45.520
 opportunistic infections. All right. This has been long enough, but let's finish with long COVID.

35:45.520 --> 35:49.920
 Um, there's really a nice perspective in the New England Journal of Medicine. Um, and it was

35:49.920 --> 35:57.120
 entitled confronting our next national health disaster, long haul COVID. Um, and the authors

35:57.120 --> 36:04.560
 suggest that factoring in new infections in unvaccinated people, we can conservatively expect

36:04.560 --> 36:12.560
 more than 15 million cases of long COVID resulting from this pandemic. Um, even though the data is

36:12.560 --> 36:19.920
 still emerging, um, the average age of patients with long COVID is about 40, um, which means that

36:19.920 --> 36:25.680
 the majority of these individuals are in their prime working years. Um, and they, they discuss

36:25.680 --> 36:31.200
 that giving these demographics long COVID is likely to cast a long shadow on our healthcare system

36:31.200 --> 36:35.680
 and the economic recovery that everyone is talking about. Um, and this is certainly

36:35.680 --> 36:41.600
 something we're continuing to see. Um, I'll conclude there before we hit emails. Um, but again,

36:41.600 --> 36:46.960
 to remind everyone, um, we are continuing to support foundation international medical relief

36:46.960 --> 36:51.360
 of children. Um, so drop what you're doing, pull over to the side of the road, go to parasites

36:51.360 --> 36:56.800
 without borders.com, um, and donate so that we can continue to help them and continue to provide

36:56.800 --> 37:02.720
 this, um, weekly COVID clinical update. Daniel, I just want to point out that transmission trial

37:02.720 --> 37:09.440
 in the UK or the, the observational study was only, most of the people were only after one dose,

37:09.440 --> 37:15.600
 so it could be better after two. That, that is, that is encouraging. All right, time for some

37:15.600 --> 37:21.360
 email. You can send yours to Daniel at microb.tv. Mark writes, I wanted to bring your attention

37:21.360 --> 37:26.960
 that there are an estimated 9 million Americans living abroad for work of retirement where

37:26.960 --> 37:32.560
 they're temporary trap. I'm based in Southeast Asia for work. I can return, but for many Americans,

37:32.560 --> 37:36.880
 it's too expensive or dangerous. The US State Department has failed to respond to this group,

37:37.520 --> 37:42.480
 something that would be easy to address via the embassies and consulates. I've written to Dr.

37:42.480 --> 37:47.840
 Francis Collins requesting this issue be raised. My question is if we can ship millions of vaccines

37:47.840 --> 37:52.400
 to India, why can't we also take care of at risk Americans currently residing outside the US? I've

37:52.400 --> 37:56.800
 written to the New York Times and Washington Post with no response. I would appreciate you raising

37:56.800 --> 38:01.040
 the issue on Twiv and forwarding my message to those persons you believe could be helpful in moving

38:01.040 --> 38:06.800
 this forward. And I mean, you're, you're making really good points here. Um, we do know, right,

38:06.800 --> 38:11.120
 that the State Department has shipped vaccines to those embassies to vaccinate their staff.

38:11.120 --> 38:20.080
 My brother-in-law is actually in the State Department stationed in Ukraine with his family. So Tim

38:20.080 --> 38:25.440
 Juliet and their three kids. And actually, people may know my other connection to the State Department.

38:25.440 --> 38:32.160
 My wife's father was a US ambassador. He was Career State Department. And yeah, this is a tough

38:32.160 --> 38:38.960
 situation. The they are, they have sent limited amounts of vaccines to vaccinate State Department

38:38.960 --> 38:44.240
 personnel. But they really haven't, you know, expanded that out to the millions of expats that

38:44.240 --> 38:50.000
 you describe. And I'm not sure what the political thinking is, is behind that. I mean, these are,

38:50.000 --> 38:54.320
 these are American citizens. We're supposed to be looking out for them. And right now in the middle

38:54.320 --> 39:01.360
 of a pandemic, looking out for someone is getting them access to a vaccine. So yeah, well, I guess

39:01.360 --> 39:06.640
 our listeners can all hear, hear this letter read on the air and hopefully something will happen.

39:06.640 --> 39:10.400
 Joy writes, there's an active clinical trial for use of monoclonals.

39:10.400 --> 39:14.800
 The Laronlem app for treating long haulers. I signed up for it in last January, but got

39:14.800 --> 39:19.520
 reinfected again before the trial began. I think there are a couple of other trials being conducted

39:19.520 --> 39:24.640
 since there are no treatment options for long COVID, M-I-S-C-P-A-S-E. I'm wondering,

39:24.640 --> 39:30.080
 why are they not testing Regeneron, etc. for that purpose? Us long haulers know who we are.

39:30.080 --> 39:35.440
 Sadly, many of us are being gaslit by the medical community. My doc has known me for most of my

39:35.440 --> 39:40.080
 life and didn't recognize this as a condition until recently. After more than a year, I'm deeply

39:40.080 --> 39:45.920
 sad and this isn't getting enough attention. After 18 months, still no medical code. My doctor

39:45.920 --> 39:50.240
 doesn't even know how to refer me to a specialist for it. My insurance will cover the long-term

39:50.240 --> 39:55.440
 effects were being denied care because our doctors are unable to code for it. I was unable to get

39:55.440 --> 40:01.120
 monoclonals after my most recent infection because my doctor didn't know how to prescribe the infusion

40:01.120 --> 40:05.840
 regarding PASK. Hope you can give us long haulers some hope and insight because the public health

40:05.840 --> 40:13.440
 and medicine system is moving too slow. Joy? Yeah. Joy, it is moving too slow. I'm going to

40:13.440 --> 40:19.600
 echo that. I mentioned last time, and maybe you can write this down and tell your physician,

40:20.320 --> 40:28.640
 but we were encouraged to currently use the code B94.8 to identify these individual, and that is for

40:28.640 --> 40:34.720
 sequelae of other specified infections and parasitic diseases. We are hoping in October, and I think

40:34.720 --> 40:41.200
 this is always shocking to me. We're hoping in October we'll be using U09.9, but what are we

40:41.200 --> 40:45.520
 supposed to do in the meantime? It reminded me of one of the discussions at one of the hospitals

40:45.520 --> 40:48.880
 where they felt like one medicine was not really effective, and they said, we're going to stop

40:48.880 --> 40:53.760
 using it on Friday. And I'm like, I'm going to stop using it today. So why don't we have a code

40:53.760 --> 40:58.720
 and start using it today, crazy as that seems. What I will say, and this is encouraging,

40:58.720 --> 41:04.400
 is there's a lot of money, and there's a lot of interest in trying to find treatments for

41:05.040 --> 41:10.160
 you, for the people suffering with long COVID. A big thing is we want to do it right. What did

41:10.160 --> 41:14.880
 we learn over the last 18 months? We can spend a lot of money and do a lot of trials and find

41:14.880 --> 41:20.080
 out nothing. It's very easy to do a bad trial. So that was actually what was triggering my

41:20.080 --> 41:25.840
 conversation with Melissa Stockwell, is there's a lot of centers that are now in stage one phase,

41:25.840 --> 41:31.280
 and it's going to then move into stage two. And there will be centers all around the country,

41:31.280 --> 41:38.320
 PASC, so post-acute squelly of COVID centers, where patients will go for treatment. They will

41:38.320 --> 41:44.240
 also go for the opportunity to participate in research, because we do not have a lot to offer.

41:44.240 --> 41:48.880
 I think I mentioned in the past, there was this suggestion that we would send people to these

41:48.880 --> 41:54.480
 centers of excellence. Well, it's not a center of excellence until we can provide excellence.

41:55.040 --> 41:59.520
 And we're not there yet. We don't have a lot of answers. The research, the clinical trials that

41:59.520 --> 42:04.560
 are all being set up are going to give us those answers, and then we will have centers of excellence.

42:04.560 --> 42:09.920
 So I want to say I'm very optimistic, but yeah, it is moving too slowly. And if you have long

42:09.920 --> 42:15.200
 COVID, it's moving much too slowly. Tom writes, our son will turn 12 early July plans to get

42:15.200 --> 42:19.920
 vaccinated on his birthday during your show last week. You mentioned the study on college athletes

42:19.920 --> 42:25.120
 responded to a parent email about myocarditis, pointing out that the long-term risk from natural

42:25.120 --> 42:29.600
 infection is much greater than from vaccination. We're also hearing some doctors saying that the

42:29.600 --> 42:35.600
 first dose might be okay, but too for a child, too much, too risky. How much does the first dose of

42:35.600 --> 42:41.920
 vaccine decrease the infection risk compared to the second dose? How much does the myocarditis risk

42:41.920 --> 42:46.960
 from the vaccine increase between first and second dose? Are you recommending one dose or two for a

42:46.960 --> 42:54.880
 12-year-old male? Yeah, so we are. I am recommending two doses of the mRNA vaccine for a 12-year-old.

42:55.840 --> 43:01.760
 And the reason we say that is all the evidence has suggested that this is a true prime boost

43:01.760 --> 43:08.320
 vaccination series. So that initial vaccination gets us a little bit of T cell, a low level of

43:08.320 --> 43:13.840
 antibodies. We've seen some of the data out of the UK, particularly against the delta variant,

43:13.840 --> 43:19.040
 not a lot of protection. You get that second dose, and you really get a boost. The antibodies

43:19.040 --> 43:26.240
 really go up, and the real-world data suggests that then you are protected. So we see the myocarditis

43:26.240 --> 43:31.520
 after that second dose. We now see that there is a certain connection here. It's been sort of,

43:32.480 --> 43:37.680
 I guess, pinned down, and we have a sense of what the rate is, what to expect. But if you want that

43:37.680 --> 43:44.320
 protection against COVID-19, maybe for a lifetime in an adolescent, I encourage two shots.

43:44.320 --> 43:51.520
 And Lori writes, Lori's a Canadian working in Kazakhstan. They received two doses of Sputnik,

43:51.520 --> 43:56.160
 but now when they come back to Canada, they're not recognized. The vaccine is not recognized by

43:56.160 --> 44:02.320
 Health Canada, so they have to be revaccinated. And so the question is, we had two doses of Sputnik

44:02.320 --> 44:09.360
 in May is two doses of another vaccine in July, bad for the body. I wouldn't say bad for the body.

44:10.400 --> 44:16.320
 You may experience some reactogenicity. I would expect that. We're seeing lots of people in the

44:16.320 --> 44:20.800
 situation you're in in Canada and the United States, other places that have the same policy.

44:21.920 --> 44:28.000
 You're going to get a little bit of extra protection, maybe. But I think it's fine to go ahead. I think

44:28.000 --> 44:35.040
 it's safe and will be effective. That's COVID-19 clinical update number 69 with Dr. Daniel Griffin.

44:35.040 --> 45:04.880
 Thank you, Daniel. Thank you, Vincent. Thank you, everyone, and be safe.
