 This week in virology, the podcast about viruses, the kind that make you sick.

00:10.320 --> 00:21.120
 From Microbe TV, this is Twiv, this week in virology episode 707 recorded on January 14, 2021.

00:21.680 --> 00:27.920
 I'm Vincent Rackeniello, and you're listening to the podcast all about viruses. Joining me today

00:27.920 --> 00:34.080
 from New York, Daniel Griffin. Hello, everyone. How's it going, Daniel?

00:35.760 --> 00:42.000
 Poorly. Poorly is the word, not well on many fronts, but let's get into the weeds.

00:42.720 --> 00:47.440
 Start with my quotation. For the world, it is drowning in paper.

00:50.720 --> 00:55.200
 I want people to think for just a second, when would someone have made that comment? When would

00:55.200 --> 01:03.760
 they have said for the world it is drowning in paper? This is said by Poirot, an Agatha Christie

01:03.760 --> 01:11.840
 character in the story, in the book Murder in Mesopotamia, which was written in 1936.

01:12.560 --> 01:17.280
 100 years ago, they thought they were drowning in paper. What do we think is happening now?

01:17.280 --> 01:22.880
 As we go forward, people will understand why maybe we should call this episode drowning in paper.

01:22.880 --> 01:33.440
 On January 8, we saw 307,983 as the daily case count for the U.S. COVID cases.

01:34.480 --> 01:43.920
 January 12, we saw 4,447 deaths. People should realize there's a delay. When you see 307,

01:43.920 --> 01:50.480
 almost 308,000 cases, two or three weeks later, we're not going to be sitting in only 4,000 deaths.

01:50.480 --> 01:56.640
 We're going to be up above 5,000. It's predicting the future based upon what we know.

01:57.440 --> 02:03.760
 We really need to start getting this different. A lot of the hospitals, I get regular alerts

02:03.760 --> 02:10.000
 every morning. How close are we to that critical census where they can no longer do elective

02:10.000 --> 02:15.760
 surgeries. They have to switch over to full crisis pandemic mode. Actually, we're starting

02:15.760 --> 02:23.280
 to see hospitals in our area. Basically, reach that. First one just reached it earlier this week.

02:23.280 --> 02:30.240
 Another hospital is just a few admissions away from being at that level. For the hospitals,

02:30.240 --> 02:35.600
 this is really difficult. This is how they actually keep the doors open, how they keep the finances

02:35.600 --> 02:41.360
 out of the red. For a lot of individuals, this is necessary care.

02:41.360 --> 02:51.200
 It's a really difficult situation. We're in here. Let's talk a little bit about vaccines.

02:51.200 --> 02:57.520
 Can you imagine the topic, the interest, the questions are now flooding in about vaccinations.

02:58.480 --> 03:02.480
 I'm going to try to talk about a few things. One of the big things I think I can bring to the

03:02.480 --> 03:07.440
 conversation is what's it like on the ground? What are we actually seeing? Not what's being

03:07.440 --> 03:13.040
 published, not what's being talked about, but what are we actually seeing? One of the big

03:13.040 --> 03:18.560
 conversations when we were looking at how are we physically going to do this was the question of

03:18.560 --> 03:24.960
 how will vaccinations impact testing? As mentioned, we have more COVID right now

03:25.840 --> 03:32.960
 than we ever had in this country. Testing still is critical. Testing saves lives.

03:32.960 --> 03:39.200
 If we stop testing, we miss an opportunity to pull those people out to prevent them from spreading

03:39.200 --> 03:45.600
 to others. We also miss an opportunity to diagnose them earlier. Testing is critical.

03:45.600 --> 03:49.120
 As we've had a lot of conversations, I'm going to talk about some of those conversations,

03:49.840 --> 03:54.240
 there seems to at least be a consensus among the people I've talked to that we need to be really

03:54.240 --> 04:02.720
 careful that vaccinations don't cannibalize our testing capacity. Two rules. One is new

04:02.720 --> 04:08.320
 and one is one we've held to for a while. One is the vaccination rule, which is never miss an

04:08.320 --> 04:14.240
 opportunity to vaccinate. This comes from our pediatrician colleagues. Kids come in,

04:14.240 --> 04:18.960
 they've got a little bit of a runny nose. Some providers say, oh, why don't we just wait until

04:18.960 --> 04:23.120
 the kid is completely healthy. The child is completely healthy. We're not treating goats here.

04:26.320 --> 04:30.960
 If you wait for that child to be completely healthy, you may be waiting a long time,

04:30.960 --> 04:36.320
 and then they may come in quite ill with a vaccine preventable illness. One of the mantras in

04:36.320 --> 04:41.120
 pediatrics is never miss an opportunity to vaccinate. Every point of care is an opportunity,

04:41.760 --> 04:47.760
 and a very similar new rule, which is never miss an opportunity to test. Every time someone

04:47.760 --> 04:53.840
 comes has an interaction with a healthcare provider, this is an opportunity to test, to find out if

04:53.840 --> 04:58.960
 they're positive and move forward. I'm going to talk a little bit about how this relates to

04:58.960 --> 05:05.520
 vaccinations and some of the troubling experiences I've had recently about people getting vaccinated

05:06.080 --> 05:10.400
 and then finding out that they're positive. Let me just relate a couple stories. I've talked a

05:10.400 --> 05:15.360
 little bit about this, but now I'm seeing it more. Early on, what I was seeing was the

05:15.360 --> 05:22.160
 healthcare professionals. They should know better, right? They got their vaccine in some of them in

05:22.160 --> 05:29.680
 mid-December, maybe towards the end of December, and then Christmas Day, New Year's Eve or New

05:29.680 --> 05:37.120
 Year's Day, exposures a few days later end up sick with COVID. We're certainly seeing people

05:37.120 --> 05:43.600
 get vaccinated and then shortly after before they get to that second dose, that 14 days when they

05:43.600 --> 05:50.960
 have that protection, getting vaccinated. A lot of this is education, and I know my large audience

05:50.960 --> 05:57.600
 is the optimum tri-state, the pro-health care physicians that listen. Really important,

05:57.600 --> 06:01.440
 I know that we're trying to get people vaccinated. It's trying to be sort of a throughput there,

06:02.000 --> 06:07.760
 but you want to make sure you reinforce because even healthcare providers got the questions

06:07.760 --> 06:12.800
 a couple yesterday. I got my vaccine three days later. I went to a restaurant. It was supposed to

06:12.800 --> 06:19.280
 be outdoor dining, but then it got cold and the tent sides came down. I realized I was indoors,

06:19.280 --> 06:25.440
 and my quick response was, obviously, you got up and left. No, they stayed and had dinner and

06:25.440 --> 06:32.160
 wanted to know if there was any protection three days after their vaccine. So big, big to reinforce

06:32.160 --> 06:37.840
 here is that we think you're starting to get some protection 10 or 14 days after the first

06:37.840 --> 06:44.080
 vaccination. Some of this stuff we're hearing the experience in Israel is a reduction of about

06:44.080 --> 06:50.720
 50%. But that doesn't mean 50-50 you're protected. That means we're seeing 50% less infections

06:50.720 --> 06:56.880
 with the same exposure. So maybe you do 30 minutes instead of 15 to get infected. We're not really

06:56.880 --> 07:04.320
 seeing that protection that we talk about until you are two weeks after the second dose of your

07:04.320 --> 07:11.040
 vaccine. And then the protection actually is quite robust, quite impressive. Let's talk about

07:11.040 --> 07:19.520
 some new sort of new vaccine results, the interim results of phase one dash two a trial of add 26

07:19.520 --> 07:27.280
 COVID-19 vaccine. This was published on the 13th in the New England Journal of Medicine. So Wednesday,

07:27.280 --> 07:32.240
 I think our episode is going to drop this Saturday, so the 16th maybe. Now we had this

07:32.240 --> 07:36.400
 information from an earlier press release, but now it came out the New England Journal. So we

07:36.400 --> 07:40.480
 have the peer reviewed journal. It's interesting. I feel like the media is treating this like

07:40.480 --> 07:48.320
 brand new news, which is interesting. But this is a peer reviewed presentation of the Johnson and

07:48.320 --> 07:56.400
 Johnson Multi-Center placebo-controlled phase one slash two trial. Looking at a little over 400,

07:56.400 --> 08:03.600
 402 randomly assigned healthy adults to receive either a single dose or a two dose schedule

08:03.600 --> 08:11.120
 of the Johnson and Johnson ad no vector vaccine. There are three cohorts. We'll talk about cohort

08:11.120 --> 08:20.240
 one. These were adults ages 18 to 55 cohort three adults 65 and older. Don't worry, we'll get to

08:20.240 --> 08:28.880
 three longer term data looking at single dose and two dose regimen and the two dose regimen

08:28.880 --> 08:34.880
 was collected in cohort two. But this is really just looking at cohort one and three, just to let

08:34.880 --> 08:39.920
 you know. What were the results that we saw published in the New England Journal? As far as

08:39.920 --> 08:48.400
 neutralizing antibody titers, they were detected in 90% or more of all the participants on day 29

08:48.400 --> 08:55.440
 after the first vaccine dose and reached 100% by day 57. That's sort of interesting, right? The

08:55.440 --> 09:01.040
 titers continuing to rise. This is not quote unquote unique for this vaccine. Other other

09:01.040 --> 09:05.520
 vaccines we have out there, you have a continued rise. But just sort of put this, I guess I'll put

09:05.520 --> 09:11.680
 it in context of a Moderna. You get your first dose 28 days later, you're getting your second

09:11.680 --> 09:18.400
 dose 14 days later. So that puts us at about day 42 compared here to day 57 to get to that level

09:18.400 --> 09:24.160
 of protection. So it takes a little bit longer. So the second dose, and I think this is an interesting

09:24.160 --> 09:30.400
 issue. This is a vaccine that is looking at coming out as a single dose. The limited data

09:30.400 --> 09:37.840
 they talked about in this paper was that a second dose increased the antibody titer by a factor of

09:37.840 --> 09:43.360
 about 2.6 to 2.9. Another thing that was interesting in this paper, people are always asking me,

09:43.360 --> 09:48.480
 hey, is there an assay for neutralizing antibody responses in this New England Journal article?

09:48.480 --> 09:55.440
 The spike binding antibody response or your total antibody actually correlated with neutralizing

09:55.440 --> 09:59.200
 antibody. So you don't need that special test. There is a commercially available neutralizing

09:59.200 --> 10:04.800
 antibody assay, but you can at least based on this data, just use a normal antibody assay.

10:05.760 --> 10:11.840
 They also report CD4 T cell responses. We care about that. Already by day 14, you were showing

10:11.840 --> 10:18.560
 you were seeing clear skewing toward the type 1 helper T cells. There was a nice robust CD8 T cell

10:18.560 --> 10:23.680
 response. No safety flags, I have to say. There was just the usual fatigue, headache,

10:23.680 --> 10:29.120
 myalgia, infection, site pain. Some of the other communications Johnson Johnson has talked about

10:29.120 --> 10:33.680
 the fact that this is a platform they've already looked at in over 100,000 people.

10:34.400 --> 10:40.960
 So this is reassuring. We expect the phase 3 trial data to come out on Johnson and Johnson

10:40.960 --> 10:47.920
 before the end of January. So expect an update on that when it's available probably about two

10:47.920 --> 10:55.840
 weeks from now. They are suggesting Johnson and Johnson is suggesting that they will have EUA,

10:56.320 --> 11:01.520
 request EUA approval February. This is, I think, the most exciting little tale I'll

11:01.520 --> 11:08.000
 set on here. As per their agreement, Operation Worsfie with the US government, by January 1st,

11:08.000 --> 11:16.000
 they will deliver 100 million vaccine doses to the US. So this is a huge shot in the arm,

11:16.000 --> 11:21.360
 so to speak, as far as vaccine doses being available. A little bit about what we're seeing

11:21.360 --> 11:27.040
 on the ground as far as the Pfizer and the Moderna. We are seeing, I think, consistent with the studies

11:27.760 --> 11:34.320
 that we are seeing reactogenicity around the first doses. And we are seeing more significant

11:34.320 --> 11:39.200
 reactogenicity after the second dose. So a person gets a low-grade temperature elevation,

11:39.200 --> 11:43.600
 they feel kind of crummy and tired after the first dose. They may feel a little more crummy,

11:43.600 --> 11:48.080
 a little more tired after the second dose. Very few of my colleagues missed work after the first

11:48.080 --> 11:53.280
 dose. Several of my colleagues missed work after the second dose. So that's just sort of something

11:53.280 --> 11:58.560
 for people to be keeping in mind as far as the timing on when they get their vaccine relative to

11:59.200 --> 12:03.280
 what important things they might have to do. And there are a couple interesting things about

12:03.280 --> 12:08.400
 this vaccine, right? So we've talked about the fact about 1 in 100,000 are having anaphylactic

12:08.400 --> 12:12.160
 reactions, right? Nobody's died. This is something that we can treat and address.

12:12.720 --> 12:18.880
 It's required that all the vaccine administration sites have the appropriate therapeutics and

12:18.880 --> 12:26.720
 personnel to deal with this. So Benadryl, an EpiPen, IV, from Odedine, steroids, things like that.

12:26.720 --> 12:30.720
 An interesting thing that we've been seeing in the Moderna is what I have, I was searching for a name

12:30.720 --> 12:35.440
 and I'm going to now call it the seven-day itch. And I think if you listen to the prior

12:35.440 --> 12:40.640
 twiv and you can get a sense of how the immune response works, first you have more visceral

12:40.640 --> 12:44.480
 terminal center development. And that right about day seven is when you get the local

12:45.440 --> 12:51.360
 terminal center production. So about day seven, in a minority of people, we're seeing that the

12:51.360 --> 12:58.160
 injection site becomes itchy, erased. There is actually a visible redness in the area.

12:58.160 --> 13:02.160
 Got some pictures people keep sending me. Take Benadryl, go to sleep, usually resolves pretty

13:02.160 --> 13:06.800
 quickly. And occasionally, if you really check, you can notice that the lymph nodes in the area

13:06.800 --> 13:12.000
 are a little bit swollen. And this is all evidence that you're getting that immune response that we

13:12.000 --> 13:18.320
 really want. What about eligibility? It has expanded. And this expanded really quickly.

13:18.320 --> 13:23.520
 On Monday, it was down to individual 75 and older. And I think a couple hours later, it was

13:23.520 --> 13:31.440
 individual 65 and older. And this whole phase one B group, at least in New York, from DC from

13:31.440 --> 13:36.880
 the White House, there's been encouragement to across the board really expand access

13:37.600 --> 13:43.120
 in response to the fact that way too many doses are sitting in freezer. So now expanded in many

13:43.120 --> 13:49.280
 areas to 65 and older, first responders, all the support staff for first responders, you know,

13:49.280 --> 13:57.360
 fire, police, investigators, public safety, any sworn civil personnel, anyone involved in corrections,

13:57.360 --> 14:01.600
 anyone involved in schools, I think it's anyone who walks close to a school at this point,

14:02.320 --> 14:09.040
 anyone who's licensed, registered or involved with child care, people in public transport,

14:09.840 --> 14:16.400
 folks in homeless shelters or working there. So they're really, you know, public facing grocery

14:16.400 --> 14:21.200
 store workers in person college instructors. I don't know if that counts you, Vincent.

14:22.960 --> 14:26.560
 They're also talking about expanding it to high risk medical conditions, people with

14:26.560 --> 14:31.920
 high risk medical conditions. The actual details about what those are are unclear. But there's

14:31.920 --> 14:37.680
 really a move. And there was a, I'm going to say it was a nice article in Teen Vogue by Priyanka

14:37.680 --> 14:43.360
 Bonsell called botching the COVID-19 vaccine rollout in New York. And it was all about trying to

14:43.360 --> 14:50.240
 move from this, this sort of threatening, you know, incarceration, carceral type model of we're

14:50.240 --> 14:54.640
 going to find you if you have issues to let's really figure out how to get those vaccines into

14:54.640 --> 15:00.480
 people's arms and hopefully a more cooperative. What can we do to get it there? And what are

15:00.480 --> 15:04.960
 the issues? Like what is happening? What is failing on the ground? So the first is an issue of trust,

15:04.960 --> 15:11.680
 right? In December, the Moderna Pfizer companies had promised and actually delivered on this that

15:11.680 --> 15:18.000
 they would produce 20 million doses. January, that would go up to 40 million, February,

15:18.000 --> 15:22.080
 or up to 80 million. So really going to really going to increase over time. So what happened

15:22.080 --> 15:26.720
 with those 20 million doses in December? Well, the first thing is the government held back 10

15:26.720 --> 15:31.600
 million, right? So they'd have enough for that second supply should suddenly the skyfall Pfizer

15:31.600 --> 15:37.200
 Moderna fail to deliver. So they only sent out 10 million. Once those 10 million ended up mostly

15:37.200 --> 15:41.280
 at acute care hospitals, the hospital said, well, we don't trust the government's going to send us

15:41.280 --> 15:45.120
 that next shipment. So we're going to take 10 million, we're going to take five million and put

15:45.120 --> 15:50.080
 them in the freezer. And then there were only five million vaccines in play. And then they're

15:50.080 --> 15:56.320
 trying to in acute care hospitals somehow figure out how to vaccinate, you know, the acute care,

15:56.320 --> 16:05.600
 the phase one a prime hospital based ICU, ER, you know, clinicians and staff. There wasn't great

16:05.600 --> 16:11.200
 communication. Basically, the vaccines would just show up and suddenly had these vaccines on hand

16:11.200 --> 16:15.600
 and you're trying to figure out what to do with them. So there really was a lot of issues here.

16:16.160 --> 16:21.040
 A couple things have happened. And I just want to point that this is true. When you see, you know,

16:21.040 --> 16:28.480
 Oh, this hospital has has either administered or allocated 62% of their vaccines. They're

16:28.480 --> 16:32.080
 counting it twice, right? They give one shot, they say, Oh, we've given one shot, but we've

16:32.080 --> 16:37.360
 allocated the other. So you're counting twice that other shot is sitting in the freezer. So a we

16:37.360 --> 16:42.720
 did 30, you know, we did 32%. But we're going to count it as 64. That's that's what we're seeing.

16:42.720 --> 16:48.720
 There's now been a push from on high. Instead of sitting on half of those vaccines,

16:49.280 --> 16:54.720
 all the vaccines are going to start flowing. Pfizer and Moderna are basically saying we can do this.

16:54.720 --> 17:00.400
 We're producing these vaccines. And we want to get those into people's arms. There is also,

17:00.400 --> 17:05.440
 I got to say, very frustrating on the ground. There's a lot of paperwork. There's more paperwork,

17:05.440 --> 17:10.560
 and it takes more time to do the paperwork and the electronic uploading than it takes to do the

17:10.560 --> 17:17.760
 vaccine. And I'm just going to provide sort of a personal story. My mom on Monday, she is in her

17:17.760 --> 17:24.800
 80s. She went to go get the vaccine. And so, you know, it was a Herculean effort. My mother has

17:24.800 --> 17:30.400
 some health issues at the moment. So my wife had to help her. Another individual had to help her.

17:30.400 --> 17:36.480
 A big thing getting her out, getting her in a car, getting her to the vaccine site. She got to

17:36.480 --> 17:40.880
 the vaccine site. She needed to be helped to finally get to the area where she could get the

17:40.880 --> 17:47.680
 vaccine. And they show her the information. And she says, Oh, my, actually, my wife picked up on this.

17:48.240 --> 17:54.240
 It has your birthday as 1931. They have your birth date off. So she tells the lady and

17:54.240 --> 18:00.640
 laces, Oh, my gosh, we can't vaccinate you. You stay here goes off to find a manager comes back

18:00.640 --> 18:06.800
 about 15 minutes later. The entire, you know, the line, the production has stopped. And then they

18:06.800 --> 18:11.520
 come up the solution that they're going to put a line through the one put in the correct digit.

18:12.080 --> 18:16.880
 My mother will initial it. Now they will vaccinate her. So, you know, we really need

18:17.680 --> 18:22.320
 basically a loosening up one of our a couple of our sites. You know, I think I've described

18:22.320 --> 18:28.960
 the pro health experience and had issues uploading the HL seven file to the New York state information

18:28.960 --> 18:33.920
 immunization system. Their response was, of course, instead of, Hey, we're going to send an IT person.

18:33.920 --> 18:38.160
 Let's figure out how to make this happen was we're not sending you any more vaccines until you

18:38.160 --> 18:44.160
 fix your IT issue at that site really kind of back to the the team boa article. We need much more

18:44.160 --> 18:50.640
 of a cooperative, transparent model. We don't need to worry about HIPAA and paperwork and electronic

18:50.640 --> 18:55.920
 uploads. We need to get those vaccines and arms. And I have to say, down here on the ground,

18:55.920 --> 19:00.240
 those vaccines are sitting in freezers. There are thousands of vaccines sitting in freezers

19:00.240 --> 19:06.400
 here. And there's a lot of organizations that are ready to get those vaccines and arms. We need

19:06.400 --> 19:12.240
 to basically hear at sort of a low level need some help there. What about AstraZeneca? People

19:12.240 --> 19:17.040
 are asking about that. Why are we not giving this life saving AstraZeneca out there? And I think

19:17.040 --> 19:22.080
 I've talked about this a little bit before. AstraZeneca and the FDA have had some challenges. We don't

19:22.080 --> 19:27.120
 have the safety. We don't have the efficacy data that the FDA would like to see. And AstraZeneca

19:27.120 --> 19:32.720
 has not been as transparent and cooperative as the US FDA would like. And just to point out,

19:32.720 --> 19:37.120
 the issue right now is not a shortage of vaccines. It's an issue getting the vaccines we have into

19:37.120 --> 19:42.320
 arms. We expect there to be a lot more vaccines to be flowing in the next few months. What about

19:42.320 --> 19:49.440
 mutations and variants of interest? And I can't see Vince's face when I say that, but I can just

19:49.440 --> 19:54.480
 imagine it. Some interesting issues I'm going to talk about when we get to passive vaccination

19:54.480 --> 20:00.800
 there. But this is sort of a growing concern. What is going on here? Do we have surveillance

20:00.800 --> 20:06.400
 systems in place that are going to tell us that something is happening? And I think the UK was

20:06.400 --> 20:11.120
 doing quite a bit of sequencing. South Africa is doing quite a bit of sequencing. There's a call

20:11.120 --> 20:16.160
 to do more sequencing here in the United States, more surveillance so that if there is a change in

20:16.160 --> 20:20.960
 the genetic code that results in a change in the amino acid sequence, that results in something

20:20.960 --> 20:27.600
 that can affect the biology of the virus. We need to know about it. And I think there's also a

20:27.600 --> 20:34.240
 growing appreciation that we maybe were a little bit relaxed in thinking that coronaviruses

20:34.880 --> 20:39.920
 didn't change very much. But there's some interesting data now suggesting that

20:39.920 --> 20:47.200
 actually over time, coronaviruses can actually change, can adjust their biology. Few vaccine

20:47.200 --> 20:53.280
 FAQs, this sort of hit here before we move forward. The big one I get all the time is,

20:53.280 --> 20:59.040
 when can I stop wearing my mask? I get vaccinated. Can I stop wearing my mask? And there's a science

20:59.680 --> 21:05.360
 and there's a moral aspect to this. And I was giving a talk for the large pro-health

21:05.360 --> 21:09.920
 pediatric group a couple of nights ago. I guess it was Tuesday night. And Jay Berger asked this

21:09.920 --> 21:15.680
 question and a very pointed question. Dan, once I have my vaccine and you have your vaccine,

21:16.480 --> 21:21.280
 and one of our friends has their vaccine, and it's been a couple of weeks, can the three of us

21:21.280 --> 21:29.440
 sit in a room together, have a drink, take off those masks? Can we do this in public? Can we do

21:29.440 --> 21:36.160
 this when we go to a party, for instance? Well, here's the thing to say. If you've been vaccinated,

21:37.040 --> 21:42.640
 it is offering new protection. But there's only preliminary evidence that is decreasing the amount

21:42.640 --> 21:49.280
 of virus that you might spread to other people. So getting vaccinated does not mean that you will

21:49.280 --> 21:54.000
 not get virus and that you will not potentially spread it to others. The other side of this,

21:54.000 --> 22:00.000
 I'll say sort of the moral issue is let's say it's next September, and everyone who wants vaccine

22:00.000 --> 22:06.240
 has gotten their vaccine and had that time to develop immunity. And the only people out there

22:06.240 --> 22:12.160
 not getting vaccines are people who have decided not to get vaccines. Do the people who've gotten

22:12.160 --> 22:18.640
 vaccines? Are they required? Should they still have to wear a mask to protect people who've decided

22:18.640 --> 22:24.000
 not to get vaccinated? Now, as a physician in the healthcare setting, I think that we'll have to

22:24.000 --> 22:29.440
 continue to wear masks. But if you go to that party, that's much more of a moral decision.

22:30.560 --> 22:36.560
 Can I stop getting tested? This relates right to the first one. If you get vaccinated,

22:38.000 --> 22:42.240
 it really comes down to the question of what is the point of that test. A lot of settings

22:42.240 --> 22:46.320
 require people to get tested on a regular basis. And in those settings, they're actually a lot

22:46.320 --> 22:49.520
 more concerned about you getting the virus and spreading it to others. So if you're

22:49.520 --> 22:54.560
 working at a long-term care facility, if you're working with patients, if you're working in a

22:54.560 --> 22:58.800
 setting where you might expose people who either have not been vaccinated, or I'm going to add

22:58.800 --> 23:03.680
 to this group, people who have an issue with mounting an effective response and are still

23:03.680 --> 23:10.560
 vulnerable, then the mask wearing continues. How long after an infection can I get the vaccine?

23:10.560 --> 23:15.440
 Now, this comes up a lot. Someone gets the infection. It's been about three weeks. They're

23:15.440 --> 23:20.800
 feeling better. Can I get the vaccine or do I have to wait three months? The three months

23:20.800 --> 23:25.840
 was thrown out for monoclonal antibodies. It was thrown out for a deprioritization when it was

23:25.840 --> 23:30.720
 really sort of limited supplies. But we're recommending that if you have access to get

23:30.720 --> 23:35.680
 vaccinated, if your ticket comes up, you do not need to wait the three months. You can wait the

23:35.680 --> 23:40.720
 three months because we've learned that you're at very low risk of being reinfected in those

23:40.720 --> 23:48.400
 three months. Recent study in the UK, maybe I'll get to it, out to six months, about 86%, or 83%

23:48.400 --> 23:52.960
 less likely to get infected. So now we've moved not into, do people get reinfected,

23:53.680 --> 23:59.920
 but over what course of time, what percent reduction in likelihood of being reinfected do you get?

23:59.920 --> 24:07.680
 I always want to make sure I talk about my BAM-Lanny V-Map, BAM-BAM, BAM-Liniva-Map.

24:07.680 --> 24:13.120
 I'm just breaking that down into what is the crazy notation. And this is a MAB at the end,

24:13.120 --> 24:19.920
 monoclonal antibody, different from an IB inhibitor. I still remember that this week in

24:19.920 --> 24:27.120
 parasitism where Vincent and I confused an IB with an AB, very upsetting to me, but we'll move

24:27.120 --> 24:31.760
 forward. A couple of things we're seeing here, and this relates back to the variants. There is

24:31.760 --> 24:38.560
 some concern with a monoclonal, whether it be a single monoclonal or two monoclonals in a cocktail,

24:39.280 --> 24:46.400
 that you are only targeting one or two of what we think are 20 different epitopes, targets on the

24:46.400 --> 24:54.160
 spike protein. So this becomes much more of an issue. Will my monoclonal antibodies still work

24:54.160 --> 24:58.960
 when there's a change in the genetic code, when there's a change in the spike protein?

24:58.960 --> 25:05.280
 I can give you a little bit of data. I will say that Eli Lilly is actively looking at this.

25:06.320 --> 25:13.040
 Regeneron with their cocktail is looking at this, the B117, we won't call it the UK variant,

25:14.000 --> 25:18.720
 looks like it is not an issue. There might be an issue with one of the epitopes with the

25:18.720 --> 25:24.640
 South African variant, but this is the whole concept that we have not just one monoclonal targeting

25:24.640 --> 25:29.440
 one site, but we have the ability to use cocktail therapy. This is also really important from a

25:29.440 --> 25:33.440
 surveillance point, so at least with some of the companies we're already talking about

25:34.240 --> 25:40.560
 starting to do some sequencing of the virus in individuals that do well, in individuals that

25:40.560 --> 25:44.640
 don't do well, so that as soon as there starts to be an issue we know, and then really having a

25:44.640 --> 25:48.720
 sense of where is the epitope that's being targeted so that we can stay on top of this. We don't want

25:48.720 --> 25:54.320
 to start having people fail monoclonal therapy only later to find that we're actually trying to give

25:54.320 --> 26:00.240
 a therapy that's binding in epitope, which has now been changed. Early inflammatory phase,

26:01.120 --> 26:08.000
 we're learning a little bit more about the encephalitis, and actually it was a nice article in CID,

26:08.000 --> 26:13.280
 clinical infectious disease. SARS-CoV-2 encephalitis is a cytokine release syndrome

26:13.280 --> 26:18.640
 evidence from cerebral spinal fluid analysis, and actually they went ahead and described that

26:18.640 --> 26:25.840
 the encephalitis was associated with glial activation, neuroinflammatory markers, and so

26:25.840 --> 26:30.640
 really sort of interesting getting more in the lines of what I think we've thought over time.

26:30.640 --> 26:36.240
 People have not really detected virus in the CSF, but it looks like this is an inflammatory

26:36.240 --> 26:41.600
 driver here. The multi-inflammatory phase, I want to sort of reinforce what we're seeing here,

26:41.600 --> 26:48.080
 is this disease can often, the inflammatory part of this disease, can often be bi-modal.

26:48.080 --> 26:52.320
 So people come in, they often come in during that second week, right, when they're starting to

26:52.320 --> 26:57.440
 have their early inflammatory phase, starting to have trouble breathing, hypoxic, increased

26:57.440 --> 27:02.320
 respiratory rate. We get them through that, we feel like they're better than they go out the door,

27:02.320 --> 27:08.320
 but as I've tried to remind people about 10% of people will come back, and they will come back

27:08.320 --> 27:15.120
 during this, we'll say, late week three, four, the late or the multi-system inflammatory phase,

27:15.120 --> 27:20.160
 and then it's really critical that people appreciate this is when you can either have a

27:20.160 --> 27:25.440
 resurgence of the inflammatory response, you can have secondary infections, you can have clots,

27:25.440 --> 27:31.120
 you really need to sort this out. Some individuals never even end up in the hospital during the

27:31.120 --> 27:36.800
 early inflammatory phase, and we just see them during this late inflammatory phase. So really

27:36.800 --> 27:42.320
 critical to do this, again, I'll hit this again, but this is why we don't want to just clap those

27:42.320 --> 27:46.960
 folks out the door, we want to make sure they have good close follow-up so that if they have an issue,

27:47.600 --> 27:54.800
 they can be treated, they can be linked to care. The tail phase, I always make sure I want to

27:54.800 --> 28:00.560
 spend some time on this, but persistent poor health post-COVID-19 is not associated with

28:00.560 --> 28:06.480
 respiratory complications or initial disease severity. This was a study out of Ireland and

28:06.480 --> 28:12.480
 it actually highlighted that even people with mild outpatient disease can have prolonged issues.

28:12.480 --> 28:16.880
 I think that's critical. We talked about an article last time where when people were really ill,

28:16.880 --> 28:22.800
 when people were in the ICU, that there actually was an increased risk of cognitive issues

28:22.800 --> 28:28.240
 and more severe with more severe disease. Another article in the Lancet, six-month

28:28.240 --> 28:33.200
 consequences of COVID-19 in patients discharged from hospital, a cohort study,

28:33.200 --> 28:42.480
 and here they looked six months out. And what did they see? Fatigue or muscle weakness in 63%

28:42.480 --> 28:50.960
 sleep difficulties, 26% anxiety or depression, 23%. And the median six-minute walking distance,

28:50.960 --> 28:57.760
 less than the lower limit of normal in about 20 to 30% of individuals. So just for all the people

28:57.760 --> 29:03.920
 that have this idea that you live or you die, unfortunately, this is what I'm quite concerned

29:03.920 --> 29:09.600
 about. People talk about economics and we've got to really keep everything open. We really

29:09.600 --> 29:15.920
 have to be careful that we're not creating. I mean, I look at that 300,000 individuals who get

29:15.920 --> 29:20.400
 infected in one day. What percent of those individuals are going to die? That's one thing.

29:20.400 --> 29:26.080
 What percent of those individuals are going to have sleep difficulties, anxiety, depression,

29:26.080 --> 29:33.200
 the inability to work, to be productive, and actually even to have social and family interactions.

29:33.200 --> 29:39.600
 So really tough here and I want to point that out. And then our fundraiser. We got a little

29:39.600 --> 29:46.560
 bit. We're about halfway through January. So we're about three quarters of the way through our

29:46.560 --> 29:52.560
 Peace Corps HIV and AIDS program fundraiser. So if you get the time, drop what you're doing,

29:52.560 --> 29:56.480
 unless you're driving, don't drop what you're doing. Go to parasiteswithoutboarders.com

29:56.480 --> 30:00.960
 and help us continue our work and help us support the Peace Corps.

30:00.960 --> 30:07.520
 Daniel, on Monday, New Jersey changed its vaccine regulations to include anyone over 65. Doesn't

30:07.520 --> 30:13.520
 matter what you do, anyone. So that's I've got an appointment for next Tuesday because of that.

30:13.520 --> 30:16.400
 If I were in New York, probably couldn't get it yet.

30:17.600 --> 30:22.160
 No, New York actually is the same. New York has gone 65 and up. Now, you couldn't get

30:22.160 --> 30:26.320
 it in New York just because we have issues, not because of an AIDS restriction.

30:26.320 --> 30:33.680
 Because you had mentioned student facing educators over 65, but you're saying all 65 and over in

30:33.680 --> 30:38.720
 New York as well as New Jersey, right? Yeah, in New York, it first went to 75, very quickly,

30:38.720 --> 30:43.440
 went to 65. I didn't realize you were over 65, Vincent, because you look so young and vital.

30:43.440 --> 30:47.520
 Thank you very much. Thank you. All right, we have a few email for you. Samantha writes,

30:47.520 --> 30:53.440
 I'm a clinical lab scientist in California. I have a question about CT values from PCR testing

30:53.440 --> 30:59.440
 in our lab. A few months back, I read that the FDA was forbidden hospital labs from releasing

30:59.440 --> 31:04.720
 CT values because they could potentially be misrepresented or could possibly misrepresent

31:04.720 --> 31:10.080
 the true patient condition. For example, a good sample versus a poor sample. After listening to

31:10.080 --> 31:14.240
 Dr. Griffin's update, it seems as though the FDA has reconsidered its position on CT,

31:14.240 --> 31:20.640
 we currently run our SARS-CoV-2 testing on an instrument called BD max. It gives CT values in

31:20.640 --> 31:25.840
 the test report, but we report only positive or negative to the providers. We're in the process

31:25.840 --> 31:31.200
 of validating a second PCR analyzer made by Perkin Elmer, but I don't know much about it,

31:31.200 --> 31:36.080
 except it's more sensitive to smaller amounts of viral RNA than the max. Long story short,

31:36.080 --> 31:40.480
 how can we get the CT information out to our medical team with the appropriate interpretive

31:40.480 --> 31:45.520
 information to go along with it? I imagine that a majority of our providers won't fully understand

31:45.520 --> 31:51.760
 the result that reads something like positive CT 32 or something along those lines. Any input

31:51.760 --> 31:59.680
 is appreciated. This is fantastic, and this is why it's so important to talk to people that are

31:59.680 --> 32:05.760
 on the ground. When the CDC changed its guidance, when the FDA changed its guidance, they said,

32:05.760 --> 32:10.800
 oh, yeah, you're welcome to share this information, and then it was in the New York Times.

32:11.600 --> 32:14.640
 And then there was the, oh, yeah, you've been able to share it all along. Well,

32:14.640 --> 32:19.280
 that messaging was not clear. The messaging that was out there, the messaging that people

32:19.280 --> 32:25.360
 received, was you can't share those CT values. So now the messaging is you can share those CT

32:25.360 --> 32:30.640
 values, and the question is, how do you do it? So I do think it's really important that we put

32:30.640 --> 32:37.440
 this in the reports. We're super busy. So currently, what I have to do, what a lot of the providers

32:37.440 --> 32:41.360
 have to do is we have to pick up the phone. We've got to call molecular. We've got to give them

32:41.360 --> 32:46.080
 the information. We've got to get to the right person. It takes a really long time to get that

32:46.080 --> 32:51.520
 number. So it would be fantastic to have it in the report. Now, the way results are reported

32:51.520 --> 32:57.280
 is really, really interesting. We have sometimes where they do a sputum and they say, oh, normal

32:57.280 --> 33:03.840
 floor. And then at some centers in bold, they say MRSA and pseudomonas not detected. And that

33:03.840 --> 33:09.680
 sort of gives a little tip to the clinician on what they might do. So my suggestion here,

33:09.680 --> 33:15.360
 for all who are listening, go ahead, still reported as positive, but then put in the print below it,

33:16.160 --> 33:21.920
 some ranges, a little level, little information about, we are running our cycles out to,

33:21.920 --> 33:27.120
 let's say it's 40 cycles, whatever it might be. And then just put what the CT value actually

33:27.120 --> 33:34.240
 is. And then, over time, we'll continue to educate, like a viral load with HIV, like a viral load

33:34.240 --> 33:39.920
 with hepatitis C, we'll be able to make sense of what those numbers are. It's also critical

33:39.920 --> 33:44.880
 that you put in the analyzer, right? Because there is a little variability from center to center,

33:44.880 --> 33:49.520
 there's variability from machine to machine. And as long as you know that, oh, this is a

33:49.520 --> 33:54.640
 perk at Elmer that was run on, we have the same issues with antibody index, antibody levels,

33:54.640 --> 34:01.760
 you know, PT Prothrombin INR. So yeah, I would love that if I'm able to look, and I'm able to

34:01.760 --> 34:07.200
 actually see positive negative and then below it can be that CT value. Page writes, Hi, Dr.

34:07.200 --> 34:12.560
 Griffin should people who test positive for COVID-19 or had positive antibodies still get vaccinated?

34:12.560 --> 34:18.880
 I know the answer is yes, but I want to know why. So yes, the answer is yes. And the reason is,

34:18.880 --> 34:25.680
 as we've we've talked about several times, is natural infection provides some natural infection,

34:25.680 --> 34:31.760
 provides some protection against reinfection. But it only lasts for a certain period of time.

34:31.760 --> 34:37.520
 And over time, your chance of getting reinfected diminishes. It certainly does not provide what

34:37.520 --> 34:45.440
 we think is going to be a 94 95% protection out to a year or two, which is what Moderna is starting

34:45.440 --> 34:52.400
 to suggest. We don't think it's going to be close to 100% protection against severe COVID.

34:53.040 --> 34:58.000
 So the reason you want to get vaccinated is you want that really high level protection

34:58.640 --> 35:04.000
 that vaccines can produce, because you do not want to get a second infection. Yes, several of the

35:04.000 --> 35:09.120
 second infections have been mild. But I was like to remind people some of those second infections

35:09.120 --> 35:14.720
 have been quite severe. We've had people with mild first infection, severe second infection.

35:14.720 --> 35:20.080
 I was just doing a talk this afternoon on the call with our urgent care physicians in the

35:20.080 --> 35:26.000
 tri-state area. And I was speaking with Bonnie Simmons, and that at some of the sites they had

35:26.000 --> 35:34.960
 done I think 5,000 tests. And she was relating one of the sites that is over by the Verrazano

35:34.960 --> 35:43.280
 Bridge void any HIPAA violations that one site had done 100 tests. One of it was a family.

35:43.280 --> 35:48.160
 The whole family came in and the whole family was sick. They all tested positive. They had

35:48.160 --> 35:54.320
 actually been sick and positive at that same facility back in April. So we are certainly seeing

35:54.320 --> 36:00.000
 reinfections. Terry writes, Dr. Griffin recently you stated patients who receive monoclonal antibody

36:00.000 --> 36:08.560
 infusion for COVID should wait 90 days to get vaccine. What's the harm in getting the vaccine 30 or 60

36:08.560 --> 36:13.120
 days after the infusion? I understand the vaccine may not be as effective at producing an immune

36:13.120 --> 36:17.520
 response. But aren't you taking a risk of the patient getting reinfected with COVID if you wait

36:17.520 --> 36:24.720
 90 days? So this is a fantastic question. And we've actually had individuals, had a husband and

36:24.720 --> 36:30.640
 wife where the wife went ahead and she got the monoclonal antibodies. But the husband didn't want

36:30.640 --> 36:39.520
 to because he wanted to get vaccinated. It's now in the hospital. And the issue is the monoclonal

36:39.520 --> 36:46.480
 antibodies will use bamelinibab, half-life of about 21 days, say, Regeneron, the cocktail,

36:46.480 --> 36:53.200
 half-life in the mid-20s. Once you get these antibodies, and this is being studied, but we think

36:53.200 --> 36:59.200
 it's true, once you get these antibodies for three months, you have high enough level that we do not

36:59.200 --> 37:06.480
 think you can be infected or reinfected. So the idea here is a person gets infected. They get

37:06.480 --> 37:11.200
 their monoclonal antibodies. They actually are immunized for three months. And then at the end

37:11.200 --> 37:17.200
 of the three months, as I like to point out, there will be less COVID circulating. There will be shorter

37:17.200 --> 37:23.920
 lines. So the reason I say waiting is you might as well wait, you're already immune. You've already

37:23.920 --> 37:30.080
 been immunized passively. So wait those 90 days, let those antibodies get out of your system,

37:30.080 --> 37:35.360
 and then go ahead and get your vaccine. All right, one more because this one is

37:36.480 --> 37:41.520
 more of a comment. Hugh writes, thank you for your comments about penalizing versus helping

37:41.520 --> 37:46.720
 vaccine administrators. I cringed when I heard Governor Cuomo threaten providers who vaccinated

37:46.720 --> 37:52.160
 out of order with $1 million fines and loss of license. Granted, he was worried about the

37:52.160 --> 37:56.800
 wealthy and influential jumping the line, the unfairness and the terrible public perception of

37:56.800 --> 38:03.840
 that. But such a massive threat also operates in terrorism. It shifts the risk of even inadvertent

38:03.840 --> 38:09.440
 error to the providers. What documentation of eligibility must be presented to protect the

38:09.440 --> 38:13.760
 provider from this dreadful liability? If I vaccinate someone who is not yet eligible,

38:13.760 --> 38:19.600
 is it a status crime, regardless of what the patient said or my intent? Where I in New York,

38:19.600 --> 38:26.720
 I might let thought vaccine go to waste rather than risk this wrath. In DC is grocery store

38:26.720 --> 38:32.240
 pharmacy had ready vaccine after all the healthcare workers present had been vaccinated. At the end

38:32.240 --> 38:37.120
 of the day, rather than let it go, they announced overhead that anyone wanting a vaccination should

38:37.120 --> 38:42.960
 report to the pharmacy. We need strong leadership to get through this. We also need thoughtful and

38:42.960 --> 38:50.480
 foresightful leaders. Thank you for your updates. Hugh is both an MD and a lawyer.

38:51.680 --> 38:58.960
 But no, I appreciate this. We have made it so hard and so difficult and all these trust issues that

38:59.520 --> 39:04.080
 the majority of vaccine produced in our country is sitting in freezers. It's not in people's arms.

39:05.200 --> 39:10.400
 This carceral approach, it doesn't make sense. The abuse has happened anyway,

39:10.400 --> 39:14.480
 and I don't think anyone will get fined. I think we've spent so much time and so much

39:14.480 --> 39:18.800
 effort focused on equity and who should be in the front of the line, that the line's not even

39:18.800 --> 39:24.320
 moving. There's no point, as I like to say, being 10th in line in a line that is not moving,

39:24.320 --> 39:31.680
 I'd rather be 100th in line than a line that is moving really quickly. We really have to ask,

39:31.680 --> 39:37.920
 how can we help make this work? We really need to get those lines moving. Instead of addressing

39:37.920 --> 39:43.760
 issues with threats, let's address these issues with offers of help. How do we make it work?

39:45.200 --> 39:50.640
 It's kind of crazy that not every dose is not in an arm. It's totally crazy.

39:51.840 --> 39:58.640
 It is amazing. All right, that is COVID-19 clinical update number 45 with Dr. Daniel Griffin.

39:58.640 --> 40:09.680
 Thank you, Daniel. Thank you, Vincent, and everyone, be safe.
