 This week in virology, the podcast about viruses, the kind that make you sick.

00:10.400 --> 00:20.400
 From Microbe TV, this is Twiv. This week in virology, Episode 778, recorded on July 8, 2021.

00:20.400 --> 00:27.200
 I'm Vincent Raccoon, hello. And you're listening to the podcast all about viruses. Joining me today

00:27.200 --> 00:34.720
 from New York, Daniel Griffin. Hello, everyone. So I understand that we have a slight uptick in

00:34.720 --> 00:39.040
 cases in the U.S. due to a few states where there are a lot of unvaccinated people.

00:40.320 --> 00:44.960
 Vincent, Vincent, have you left the echo chamber? It's the Delta variants, of course.

00:44.960 --> 00:51.440
 Oh, I forgot. Nothing says nothing to do with a lack of vaccination, a lack of masking,

00:52.160 --> 00:55.840
 nothing to do with human behavior. It's all the virus. We're all doing the right things.

00:55.840 --> 01:03.360
 Got it. Got it. No, I have to say, I think I went through stages of frustration and I've

01:03.360 --> 01:07.840
 sort of come out the other side earlier today. I was listening. It's actually Carl Zimmer,

01:07.840 --> 01:13.760
 right? Talking about how he's welcoming people into the Delta Club. He knew this was coming.

01:13.760 --> 01:19.120
 It would be the end of the world. And Vincent, when you say it's exactly true, you look at a map

01:19.120 --> 01:27.920
 and where people did not get vaccinated, they're getting COVID. But the hospitalizations and deaths

01:27.920 --> 01:34.880
 are not going up, right? I don't understand. No. That is something that I was doing to talk

01:34.880 --> 01:41.040
 yesterday, actually talking about what is the story with the Delta variant? What is this concept

01:41.040 --> 01:47.360
 of transmissibility? And actually, I will tell everyone a little shame that I didn't get with

01:47.360 --> 01:56.960
 777, but I did really enjoy to have 777. And I think it's important because sloppy language,

01:57.600 --> 02:02.800
 I think puts us all at risk because there's this concept, right? I did sort of a thought

02:02.800 --> 02:06.960
 experiment in this talk I did yesterday. I said, what does transmission mean to you?

02:07.840 --> 02:11.600
 And then I had asked some people before the show. And one of them was like, well, I heard

02:11.600 --> 02:16.880
 it's so transmissible that two people were walking in the street and one person walked

02:16.880 --> 02:22.400
 by the other and got COVID. I'm like, let's be honest, they were having an affair. I mean,

02:25.280 --> 02:29.360
 so, you know, and I think then people start, oh, the masks don't even work. Why do I bother?

02:29.360 --> 02:35.120
 The vaccines don't work. Why do I bother? And the reality is, is that, yeah, there is a fitness

02:35.120 --> 02:40.320
 advantage to the Delta variant. That's fine. We keep seeing different variants. And, you know,

02:40.320 --> 02:46.640
 no one ever sort of raised the specter with flus in past years. So I'm not sure why science is be

02:46.640 --> 02:53.840
 damned during times of COVID, but I'm sure we'll get into that. But no, I mean, the vaccines,

02:53.840 --> 02:58.720
 as we'll talk about continue to be very effective. Areas with excellent vaccination coverage have

02:58.720 --> 03:03.120
 low rates, areas like Nevada, Missouri, other areas where they're not getting vaccinated,

03:03.760 --> 03:08.560
 lots of COVID. But we're not seeing, you know, suddenly, if you look at the numbers across the

03:08.560 --> 03:13.680
 country, we're not seeing suddenly that the hospitals are getting full again. It's all regional,

03:13.680 --> 03:17.840
 it all corresponds to poor vaccine uptake. Our quotation will hit right onto this.

03:18.480 --> 03:24.880
 It may be said that natural selection is daily and hourly scrutinizing throughout the world.

03:24.880 --> 03:30.640
 Every variation, even the slightest rejecting that which is bad, preserving and adding up all

03:30.640 --> 03:38.320
 that is good, silently and insensibly working. And that's right out of on the origin of species

03:38.320 --> 03:44.240
 by Charles Darwin. And I would say it's good. You want to quote Charles Darwin right out of his

03:44.240 --> 03:50.080
 writing because there are so many misquotes, Darwin out there. Some of them even etched in

03:50.080 --> 03:56.560
 marble that were never said by Charles Darwin. But now I know that when we do science communication,

03:57.200 --> 04:04.320
 people think that the intelligence level of the genuine population is about fifth grade level or

04:04.320 --> 04:09.040
 such. But I don't think that's true, particularly the Twiv audience. I think people can understand

04:09.600 --> 04:14.400
 survival of the fittest and the concepts that the viruses are competing against

04:15.440 --> 04:24.480
 themselves. And we are just behaving poorly. But okay, children, COVID and mental health,

04:24.480 --> 04:28.080
 as I like to say, children are at low risk, but they are not at no risk.

04:28.080 --> 04:35.440
 A really nice discussion. I think people are realizing COVID is becoming endemic. So really,

04:35.440 --> 04:42.800
 the selection of parent and adolescent is making is what is the risk of vaccination versus what is

04:42.800 --> 04:49.920
 the risk of eventually getting COVID. And really nice conversations having yesterday with a colleague

04:49.920 --> 04:56.160
 of mine, Michael Amala, just about there may be an increased incidence of cardiac inflammation

04:56.160 --> 05:03.520
 after vaccination. This in no way compares to the incredibly high incidence and severity that we see

05:04.160 --> 05:11.280
 when these kids actually get COVID. All right, so let's move to transmission, pre-exposure period

05:11.280 --> 05:17.680
 transmission. Still never miss an opportunity to test. We're falling down quite a bit on this.

05:19.040 --> 05:24.880
 But one of the things I get a lot of questions about, and we had a nice MMWR early release about

05:24.880 --> 05:33.440
 this, is what about these air purifiers? And the early release entitled efficacy of portable air

05:33.440 --> 05:41.040
 cleaners and masking for reducing indoor exposure to simulated exhaled SARS-CoV-2 aerosols,

05:41.040 --> 05:48.240
 United States 2021. Now, I have to say, this sounds like it was a fun project. So let me go

05:48.240 --> 05:56.160
 through what the authors did. The authors reported using a breathing aerosol source simulator to

05:56.160 --> 06:01.440
 mimic a meeting participant, exhaling infectious particles. That was the source. And then there

06:01.440 --> 06:07.760
 were three breathing simulators used to mimic a speaker, two participants exposed to these aerosol

06:07.760 --> 06:12.080
 particles. And interestingly enough, these simulators were actually head forms with

06:12.080 --> 06:21.120
 elastomeric skin from Hanson Robotics used to use to do these experiments. They set them up,

06:22.160 --> 06:27.600
 set to either 15 liters per minute or 28 liters per minute. And then they use these optical particle

06:27.600 --> 06:32.880
 counters to collect aerosol particles. There's a figure in the paper, but I have to say,

06:32.880 --> 06:37.440
 I wanted to see the video. I'm going to have to admit, this must have been cool. And they did

06:37.440 --> 06:43.680
 report that based upon this investigation, using two HEPA air cleaners close to the aerosol source,

06:43.680 --> 06:50.640
 reduced the aerosol exposure of the uninfected participants and speaker by up to 65% and a

06:50.640 --> 06:56.400
 combination of the HEPA air filters and universal masking reduced exposures by up to 90%.

06:57.760 --> 07:02.240
 But there's a few comments. I mean, this is a big topic, but a few comments. First,

07:02.240 --> 07:10.160
 just this was really a simulated basically air cleaning procedure. There's no SARS-CoV-2

07:10.160 --> 07:15.120
 in this paper. This paper actually doesn't really tell us anything about the actual

07:15.120 --> 07:21.760
 transmission of SARS-CoV-2. It just tells us about how you might keep droplet particles aerosols

07:21.760 --> 07:27.680
 out of the air. So I think that's important. When people ask me about the HEPA air cleaners,

07:27.680 --> 07:35.120
 I say sounds great. There's no magic barrier at six feet. So you get in that suburban home

07:35.120 --> 07:40.160
 with poor airflow, you get in that office, you start getting a lot of people in there. And I think

07:40.160 --> 07:45.120
 that it's reasonable to consider these air purifiers, reasonable to open those windows.

07:46.160 --> 07:51.200
 Your wrist does not go to zero when you hit six feet. So this is interesting, but

07:51.200 --> 07:56.000
 realize I've seen a lot of retweets of this, look, we've been saying this forever. I'm not sure

07:56.000 --> 08:00.960
 what you've been saying forever. This just tells you that air filters do filter the air.

08:01.840 --> 08:07.920
 All right. Active vaccination. Never miss an opportunity to vaccinate. And vaccination is how

08:07.920 --> 08:13.600
 this pandemic ends. And we are seeing that across the country. So last week, I talked about the

08:13.600 --> 08:21.840
 preprint serum neutralizing antibody of mRNA 1273 against SARS-CoV-2 variants. That's the Moderna

08:21.840 --> 08:27.360
 vaccine. And this suggested that the Moderna mRNA vaccine produced antibody levels with neutralized

08:27.360 --> 08:34.400
 activity against several SARS-CoV-2 variants, including the Delta variant. I also mentioned

08:34.400 --> 08:40.800
 the data from the UK suggesting the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine 88% effective against symptomatic

08:40.800 --> 08:48.000
 disease from from the Delta variant, then the AstraZeneca about 60%. This week, we had some

08:48.000 --> 08:58.400
 data on the J&J vaccine in the form of the preprint, add 26, COVID-2, S elicited neutralizing

08:58.400 --> 09:05.040
 activity against Delta and other SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. So similar to the Moderna

09:05.040 --> 09:13.360
 preprint, the authors tested Sierra from recipients who'd gotten a single dose of the J&J. This is

09:13.360 --> 09:20.880
 the J&J vaccine. They tested the Sierra for neutralizing activity against several SARS-CoV-2

09:20.880 --> 09:29.840
 variants. All tested variants demonstrated susceptibility to the induced serum neutralization,

09:29.840 --> 09:37.200
 albeit there was reduction compared to the B1 strain. Most pronounced reduction was observed

09:37.200 --> 09:46.880
 for the beta. That was about 3.6. The gamma, that was 3.4. Now, there was only a 1.6-fold reduction

09:46.880 --> 09:53.520
 observed for the widely spreading Delta variant. A couple comments here. This work was done using

09:53.520 --> 10:00.800
 pseudotyped virus. And again, this is looking at antibodies, right? This is not looking at T cells.

10:00.800 --> 10:06.720
 This is also not giving us real world experience as far as the ability of the J&J vaccine to

10:06.720 --> 10:13.440
 reduce our chance of getting sick, to reduce our chance of getting infected. But I do know,

10:13.440 --> 10:18.720
 I get lots of questions. We got all these people wanting to top off their immunity after J&J

10:18.720 --> 10:26.240
 with an mRNA vaccine. This does not support that. That is not currently recommended. If anything,

10:26.800 --> 10:31.680
 this would give people, I think, maybe a little bit of confidence that even just looking at the

10:31.680 --> 10:37.840
 antibody levels, and we really think that J&J's power is in a T cell response, that we're maybe

10:37.840 --> 10:44.320
 better off from a J&J standpoint with a circulating Delta relative to the gamma or the beta.

10:45.600 --> 10:52.080
 Now, last week, I also discussed effect of vaccination on household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in England.

10:52.960 --> 10:58.240
 And that was where they reported that vaccination was associated without a 40 to 50% reduction in

10:58.240 --> 11:05.360
 transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in household context. But as Vincent brought up, most of the vaccinated

11:05.360 --> 11:12.560
 index patients in this data set, 93% had only gotten the first dose of vaccine. I know when I

11:12.560 --> 11:17.120
 discuss my wife with this with my wife, her comment was, well, that's useless. Well, remember,

11:17.680 --> 11:23.760
 this was the UK. There had been a significant period of time where people had only gotten one dose.

11:23.760 --> 11:31.600
 So we're hoping that after a second dose that that reduction is even more. So I just want to

11:31.600 --> 11:36.720
 point that out. But we did get a little more information in this realm. The New England Journal

11:36.720 --> 11:48.720
 of Medicine had a paper, prevention and attenuation of COVID-19 with BNT 162B2 and mRNA 1273 vaccines.

11:48.720 --> 11:54.880
 So this is the Pfizer BioNTech and the Moderna vaccine. And I think this paper is also helping

11:54.880 --> 12:01.280
 to build the story that people who get vaccinated not only are protected themselves, but there may

12:01.280 --> 12:09.360
 be an impact on interrupting transmission. So these were a number of participants. They

12:09.360 --> 12:16.160
 excluded participants with laboratory documentation of SARS-CoV-2 infection prior to the start of

12:16.160 --> 12:23.920
 the study. And then they went ahead and conducted a prospective cohort study on 3975 health care

12:23.920 --> 12:29.760
 personnel, first responders and other essential and frontline workers. And they looked from December

12:29.760 --> 12:37.440
 14, 2020 to April 10, 2021. And I mean, I have to say, this is great. The participants completed

12:37.440 --> 12:47.360
 weekly SARS-CoV-2 testing, mid-terminate nasal swabs for qualitative and quantitative PCR testing.

12:47.920 --> 12:58.320
 Now 796 or 20% of these individuals were completely unvaccinated. About 636 had received

12:58.320 --> 13:05.680
 at least one dose. 2543 had gotten two doses. And they report that they detected SARS-CoV-2

13:05.680 --> 13:14.880
 infection in five of those that were fully vaccinated, 11 partially vaccinated, 156 unvaccinated.

13:14.880 --> 13:19.120
 And I remember different denominators down. So I break this down into what percent are we looking

13:19.120 --> 13:28.640
 at. About 0.2% of the fully vaccinated, 1.7% of the partially vaccinated, 20% of the unvaccinated

13:28.640 --> 13:37.120
 got infected. So you're about 100 times less likely to get infected, about a two-log reduction

13:37.120 --> 13:44.000
 in even testing positive after the vaccination. They then went one step further to look at the

13:44.000 --> 13:51.760
 level of the viral mRNA, right? Not actually looking at live or infectious or active virus,

13:51.760 --> 13:57.440
 but looking at viral mRNA. And they also looked at the duration at which you can detect this.

13:57.440 --> 14:05.120
 In the vaccinated, their data showed lower levels of viral RNA and a lower percentage of individuals

14:05.120 --> 14:12.480
 still had detectable viral RNA for greater than one week. So I think this is compelling, right?

14:13.120 --> 14:17.520
 This is data showing that people who are vaccinated are less likely to get infected.

14:18.080 --> 14:23.200
 I always point out that if you can't get infected, you can't spread it to others. Also

14:23.200 --> 14:29.280
 suggesting, as we've seen, that if you do get infected after vaccination, it looks like there's

14:29.280 --> 14:36.320
 less viral RNA. Also looks like that is present detectable for a shorter period of time.

14:37.200 --> 14:43.360
 Now, one of the big things that keeps coming up, right, is what is your sort of altruistic,

14:44.240 --> 14:49.440
 your civic virtue to getting vaccinated. And so I'm going to share a story because I think if

14:49.440 --> 14:54.160
 people think these things through, let me say, yeah, I guess I should get vaccinated. And this was a

14:54.160 --> 15:00.080
 call I got on Thursday evening. And the story was it was a three-year-old. I got the call from the

15:00.080 --> 15:05.920
 grandparents who are physicians. This three-year-old, most of the pandemic isolated in the home,

15:05.920 --> 15:12.800
 now has the opportunity to go off to a daycap. And the mom's excited. She's pregnant, has another

15:12.800 --> 15:17.760
 child under the age of 10 as well. And on Thursday morning, everyone's ready for the

15:17.760 --> 15:22.480
 July 4th exciting weekend. There could be the two sisters, the grandparents, the two grandchildren.

15:23.200 --> 15:29.040
 The three-year-old starts to feel not well. Sort of runny nose, and they get a call that morning

15:29.040 --> 15:35.200
 from the camp. I'm sorry, but the camp counselor that has been taking care of your three-year-old

15:35.200 --> 15:43.200
 just called us to let us know that they have COVID. Unvaccinated camp counselor, the three-year-old

15:43.200 --> 15:50.000
 gets tested, and the three-year-old has COVID. So let's look at the impact of that counselor's

15:50.000 --> 15:55.680
 decision to not get vaccinated and work around children. So that counselor transmitted the virus

15:55.680 --> 16:01.200
 to the three-year-old. We now have a pregnant woman at home with a six-year-old. We have a

16:01.200 --> 16:06.480
 three-year-old who's got COVID, who now can't go back to camp. Finally, had had some social

16:06.480 --> 16:11.440
 interaction. The six-year-old is in quarantine. So the six-year-old can't go to camp.

16:11.440 --> 16:16.720
 The pregnant woman's sister had come out for the four-day weekend to all be together.

16:16.720 --> 16:24.480
 She leaves immediately. The two grandparents leave. What a disaster. So just think about the fact,

16:24.480 --> 16:29.200
 our decisions affect our community. They affect others. If you're going to work around young,

16:29.200 --> 16:36.080
 unvaccinated vulnerable children or other vulnerable populations, your decisions don't just affect

16:36.080 --> 16:42.240
 you. They affect others. And I think this is just sort of a story about how that person's decision

16:42.960 --> 16:47.440
 really had a significant impact. So let's think about that when we make our decisions.

16:47.440 --> 16:52.800
 All right. The period of detectable viral replication, the viral symptom phase,

16:53.600 --> 16:57.200
 the time for monitoring and monoclonals. I like to say where you get your test is

16:57.200 --> 17:03.040
 ideally where you should get your monoclonals. And I have to say, anticipate in the next couple

17:03.040 --> 17:08.480
 months. I'm very optimistic we're going to have some exciting small molecule inhibitor results.

17:09.440 --> 17:15.360
 Sort of an option going into the fall and winter when we will still have COVID-19.

17:16.000 --> 17:20.480
 But some less exciting data on ivermectin with the publication of the paper.

17:20.480 --> 17:26.560
 ivermectin to prevent hospitalization in patients with COVID-19. ivercorre COVID-19,

17:26.560 --> 17:33.760
 a randomized double blind placebo control trial in BMC infectious diseases. So a lot of people

17:33.760 --> 17:39.200
 were waiting for this. This was nicknamed the Corientis trial. This was a randomized double

17:39.200 --> 17:46.240
 blind placebo controlled study conducted in non hospitalized individuals with COVID-19

17:46.240 --> 17:55.600
 in Corientes, Argentina. So patients with SARS-CoV-2, positive nasal swabs were contacted within 48

17:55.600 --> 18:01.040
 hours of that positive test by telephone to invite them to participate. The trial then

18:01.040 --> 18:10.080
 randomized 501 patients between August 19, 2020 and February 22, 2021. The patients were

18:10.080 --> 18:16.720
 randomized to receive ivermectin. It was a weight-based dosing with an N of 250, the placebo N of

18:16.720 --> 18:26.080
 251. This treatment was for two days with this weight-based. The efficacy of ivermectin to prevent

18:26.080 --> 18:33.440
 hospitalizations was evaluated as the primary outcome. The mean age was 42 years and the mean

18:33.440 --> 18:38.720
 time since symptom onset to inclusion was four days, right? So this was actually quite early.

18:39.680 --> 18:45.680
 The primary outcome of hospitalization was met in 5.6 percent of the individuals in the ivermectin

18:45.680 --> 18:54.800
 group, 8.4 percent in the placebo group. The p value on this difference was 0.227. Time to

18:54.800 --> 18:59.840
 hospitalization was not statistically different between the groups. The mean time from study

18:59.840 --> 19:07.600
 enrollment to invasive mechanic, ventilatory support was 5.25 days in the ivermectin, 10 days

19:07.600 --> 19:14.080
 in the placebo group. That actually, interesting enough, was statistically significant. People in

19:14.080 --> 19:20.720
 the ivermectin group, on average, ended up on a mechanical ventilation in about five days versus

19:20.720 --> 19:29.920
 10 days in placebo. That's a p value of 0.019. I know there's a lot of people who are really

19:29.920 --> 19:36.880
 passionate about ivermectin. There's this buzz that's a crime against humanity that not everyone

19:36.880 --> 19:42.640
 is getting ivermectin. But I have to say, so far, we are not seeing the science to support that

19:42.640 --> 19:50.480
 degree of excitement. At this point, still, we're not recommending use of ivermectin outside of

19:50.480 --> 19:57.040
 clinical trials. If anything, I think this also gives us a boundary of how potentially effective

19:57.040 --> 20:03.760
 ivermectin could possibly be if we have a larger powered study. So, put that in context. I'm sure

20:03.760 --> 20:09.920
 I will get some fairly friendly constructive comments. All right, the early inflammatory phase.

20:09.920 --> 20:17.760
 The publication, association between administration of IL-6 antagonist and mortality among patients

20:17.760 --> 20:24.800
 hospitalized for COVID-19, a meta-analysis. And this is out of React, right? So, that is the WHO,

20:24.800 --> 20:31.520
 rapid evidence appraisal for COVID-19 therapies, the React working group. And there's a couple of

20:31.520 --> 20:36.560
 these, right? I think I've shared that I sit on the American Society of Hematology working group

20:36.560 --> 20:41.920
 working group, looking at anticoagulation, a number of individuals sit on this WHO group.

20:41.920 --> 20:46.560
 And what they're doing is they're looking at data that we have. Actually, there's a lot of

20:46.560 --> 20:51.040
 communication even ahead of time with the researchers prior to things being published.

20:51.680 --> 20:58.240
 This paper was published in JAMA and just reinforces the role in select patients of IL-6

20:58.240 --> 21:03.440
 antagonist therapy, right? So, this is tosy, tosyllismat that we've talked about.

21:03.440 --> 21:12.800
 This was a prospective meta-analysis of 27 randomized trials, including 10,930 patients of whom

21:12.800 --> 21:21.840
 2,565 died by 28 days. The 28-day all-course mortality was lower among patients who received

21:21.840 --> 21:28.640
 the IL-6 antagonists compared with those who received usual care or placebo. But I want to break

21:28.640 --> 21:33.280
 down because I think this is really critical and I want our listeners to catch this. The summary

21:33.280 --> 21:40.320
 odds ratio for the Association of IL-6 antagonist treatment with 28-day all-course mortality

21:40.320 --> 21:50.320
 was 0.78, so a 22% reduction with concomitant administration of corticosteroids. It was 1.09,

21:50.320 --> 21:56.400
 so about a 9% increase in mortality if the patients did not get corticosteroids.

21:56.400 --> 22:02.640
 So, I think this really enforces this paradigm now in a lot of our treatment guidelines.

22:03.600 --> 22:10.160
 Patient comes to the hospital. Their oxygen saturation is less than 94%. We start them on

22:10.160 --> 22:16.160
 steroids. They progress to a higher level of oxygen requirement. Then we look at adding the IL-6

22:16.160 --> 22:22.400
 antagonist tosyllismab. If you do not give them steroids, do not give them tosyllismab. This is

22:22.400 --> 22:27.920
 not a treatment for everyone. It's a select group. If they escalate to that higher level of oxygen,

22:27.920 --> 22:32.960
 you have a window of only about 48 hours to jump on board. If you wait to day three,

22:32.960 --> 22:38.240
 we actually see that we make things worse. This should be done with someone who knows these

22:38.240 --> 22:46.800
 fine details. The tail phase long COVID. This, I have to say, was the excitement of my week. I

22:46.800 --> 22:53.120
 really enjoyed seeing this Lancet preprint, the impact of COVID-19 vaccination on symptoms of

22:53.120 --> 23:01.120
 long COVID, an international survey of people with lived experience of long COVID. Now, the authors

23:01.120 --> 23:08.560
 invited patients with long COVID to complete a web-based questionnaire. 900 people were invited

23:08.560 --> 23:14.000
 to participate, and several were excluded for different reasons. So, ultimately, we end up

23:14.000 --> 23:23.360
 analyzing 812 individuals. Following vaccination, 57.9% of participants reported improvement in

23:23.360 --> 23:32.720
 symptoms. 17.9% reported that they felt worse. 22.2% said they were really just about the same.

23:33.760 --> 23:37.200
 And there was considerable individual variation in these responses.

23:37.200 --> 23:43.760
 A larger improvement in symptom severity were seen in those who received the mRNA vaccines

23:43.760 --> 23:50.640
 compared to the adenoviral vector vaccines. So, this is the UK. So, sort of think about that,

23:50.640 --> 23:58.640
 a few comments. Since this was the UK, only 130 of these individuals had received a second dose of

23:58.640 --> 24:05.280
 vaccine. So, here, we're actually seeing a 57.9% of participants reporting improvement after just

24:05.280 --> 24:10.320
 a single dose of vaccine. And I think I've shared that a lot of us have had the experience that we

24:10.320 --> 24:17.040
 pick up more responders with a second dose. This was an online survey, right? So, it recruited

24:17.040 --> 24:22.720
 participants via social media and is not really representative of the entire population of people

24:22.720 --> 24:28.720
 with long COVID. Most of the respondents identified as white. And by most, I mean over 90%.

24:28.720 --> 24:37.280
 Over 80% were female. There was no control group here. I will say that there was a great

24:37.280 --> 24:42.320
 figure two. And I want people to hopefully be linked to on the Parasites Without Borders website,

24:42.320 --> 24:47.920
 right? And you can go to this right after you donate. But there's a great figure two. And figure

24:47.920 --> 24:51.840
 two is nice to look at, well, what is getting better? Because people always ask me that. Is there

24:51.840 --> 24:58.400
 a profile of who gets better? We saw individuals with fatigue, reporting improved fatigue,

24:58.400 --> 25:04.560
 brain fog improved, my algaes improved, shortness of breath improved, insomnia improved,

25:05.360 --> 25:10.320
 chest pain, a lot of these individuals says ongoing chest pain, that improved or resolved,

25:10.320 --> 25:15.920
 gastrointestinal symptoms, maybe underappreciated earlier in the pandemic. A lot of these individuals

25:15.920 --> 25:23.520
 have ongoing reflux, diarrhea, discomfort that improves. The inability to smell interesting

25:23.520 --> 25:28.800
 after seeing improvement after vaccination, the autonomic dysfunction, the pot that we've all

25:28.800 --> 25:34.320
 heard about, even these individuals that have chronic cough, fever, rash or other vascular issues.

25:34.320 --> 25:41.760
 So the authors comment a little bit about the fact that there was no control group. They do

25:41.760 --> 25:46.240
 point out that the majority of patients had been experienced as symptoms for at least nine months

25:46.240 --> 25:52.080
 when they enrolled them. And there was a return to baseline for at least half of the patients

25:52.080 --> 25:58.160
 within one month of vaccination. So there's a nice sort of timing here suggesting that

25:58.160 --> 26:03.680
 for the majority of long COVID patients receiving a vaccination not only offers protection against

26:04.320 --> 26:11.200
 reinfection, but also may potentially improve their symptoms. So all right, I will finish there

26:11.200 --> 26:17.440
 today. And just remind everyone throughout the months of May, June and July, we're in July already.

26:17.440 --> 26:22.080
 I was shocked that we've already gotten there. We are going to continue to take your donations.

26:22.080 --> 26:25.920
 We're going to match them. We're going to continue to help Foundation International Medical Relief

26:25.920 --> 26:31.040
 of Children. And I think one thing that is maybe clear to everyone, as good as things are getting

26:31.040 --> 26:36.160
 in parts of the United States, you look at areas like Sub-Saharan Africa, only about one or two

26:36.160 --> 26:40.800
 percent of those individuals even have access to vaccines. Here are all these discussions in the

26:40.800 --> 26:48.400
 US. Should I get a third dose? Should I top off my J&J? Just remember, so many parts of the world,

26:48.400 --> 26:53.200
 they don't even have access to that first dose. And we want to work with these groups and try to

26:53.200 --> 26:57.440
 help support them so they can get back in these areas, help with the vaccine rollout. And you can

26:57.440 --> 27:02.480
 be part of that. So thank you. Time for some email questions for Daniel. You can send yours to

27:02.480 --> 27:11.360
 Daniel at microbe.tv. Carrie from Southern California has arranged monoclonal antibody treatment for

27:11.360 --> 27:19.120
 over 40 patients in the last two months. But there are still high risk patients who are eligible.

27:19.840 --> 27:27.120
 However, resources in his area have been reprioritized. And the monoclonal infusing clinic is being

27:27.120 --> 27:32.480
 closed with referral of high risk patients to community sites. But the problem is we haven't found

27:32.480 --> 27:38.240
 any. The HHS and Regeneron websites have extensive lists of Regeneron-Covian fusion sites. But every

27:38.240 --> 27:43.040
 one of them in our area have ceased operation. County and state funding appears to be drying up.

27:43.040 --> 27:48.320
 There don't seem to be any alternatives for patients in our community. If you found a similar

27:48.320 --> 27:54.240
 problem in your area, are there any national efforts to allow continued treatment with monoclonals?

27:54.240 --> 27:59.600
 I'm interested in your thoughts. Thanks for all you do. Yeah, I mean, that's disturbing,

27:59.600 --> 28:05.040
 disheartening, I have to say. I was actually just on the phone earlier today with Adam Fitterstein.

28:05.040 --> 28:08.560
 He's the head of our pro-health urgent care. He's just talking, are they having any issues?

28:08.560 --> 28:14.480
 So I always try to keep this on my radar. We're very fortunate. We continue to be very fortunate

28:14.480 --> 28:20.800
 in the New York Tri-State area. Our partners, the Catholic hospitals, you can send an individual

28:20.800 --> 28:25.760
 right over. A few hours later, they're on their way home having already received their monoclonals.

28:25.760 --> 28:31.760
 The large healthcare system northwell is jumping in with their tents as well. We really have good

28:31.760 --> 28:36.960
 access here locally. But what you're saying is actually, I've heard that this is starting to

28:36.960 --> 28:42.320
 be a problem nationally. There's no profit here, right? We live in a capitalist society.

28:42.320 --> 28:47.200
 The number of COVID cases are dropping down. A lot of people are returning to business as usual.

28:47.200 --> 28:51.840
 There isn't this huge demand for monoclonals in many parts of the country. There certainly

28:51.840 --> 28:59.120
 should be in some others. Yeah, this is a problem. I remember in my previous incarnation, I spent

28:59.120 --> 29:04.560
 some time in Washington actually training lobbyists. I can believe that. And one of the things is,

29:04.560 --> 29:09.760
 you've got to create in a capitalist society a model that really makes people encouraged to

29:09.760 --> 29:13.280
 do this. I hate to say that, right? We should all just do this because it's the right thing.

29:13.280 --> 29:20.080
 But these medicines, the Regeneron products are bought by the government. Maybe you can charge

29:20.080 --> 29:26.400
 into infusion, but there really isn't a big market driver to get this done. So they continue to be

29:26.400 --> 29:32.960
 one of our most effective, if not our only most effective during that first week. We're lucky in

29:32.960 --> 29:37.680
 the New York state area. But yeah, this is a problem. And hopefully the word people are listening,

29:37.680 --> 29:43.200
 and we can get this addressed. So Darcy writes about an experience with his first asterism

29:43.200 --> 29:49.600
 zenika jab. He has had a prior history of anaphylaxis to contrast agents used during an MRI scan.

29:50.880 --> 29:54.800
 Initially, he was okay, but had an arrhythmia bad enough to need the emergency room,

29:55.440 --> 30:00.000
 and had had several synths taking me there since each time discharged with no insights.

30:00.000 --> 30:05.120
 While I had a history of palpitations and some arrhythmia is nothing significant for years,

30:05.120 --> 30:09.120
 could be entirely coincidental that it happened within five days of my first jab.

30:09.120 --> 30:13.520
 I'm awaiting a variety of tests to see what might be going on. But in the meantime,

30:13.520 --> 30:20.000
 I kept getting contacted about my second and now overdue AstraZeneca jab. The doc told me not to

30:20.000 --> 30:25.840
 get the second one until I had some cardio investigations, but with the Delta variant and

30:25.840 --> 30:30.880
 pressure from social and familiar sources to be fully vaccinated. I wonder if you can comment on

30:30.880 --> 30:35.920
 your experiences regarding arrhythmias and COVID vaccination, whether a second jab could

30:35.920 --> 30:40.960
 exacerbate arrhythmia symptoms. There's several things here, and this is a great,

30:40.960 --> 30:46.960
 great email, great question. What we are doing in the US, if someone had an issue with one

30:46.960 --> 30:51.200
 vaccination, and here it will be, let's say it was Pfizer, Moderna, those are two dose,

30:51.760 --> 30:58.880
 we might look at switching over to a different vaccine, and it is. It's the mRNA vaccines that

30:58.880 --> 31:03.760
 really have this connection. We're saying it's about one in 100, one in 200,000

31:03.760 --> 31:08.880
 risk of a myocarditis. I don't know if that's what's causing the arrhythmia. I'm not even sure

31:08.880 --> 31:14.720
 it's causal, certainly here. But a lot of this is going to depend where you are in the world.

31:14.720 --> 31:20.560
 If you had an issue with that first AstraZeneca vaccine, do you have the ability to switch to

31:20.560 --> 31:26.800
 a different vaccine to complete this? Can you go ahead and then do a Pfizer 2 dose, which would

31:26.800 --> 31:32.160
 be actually how we would approach that. We would just give, at this point, heterogenous or mix and

31:32.160 --> 31:38.400
 match. That's going to sort of depend where you are. If you do not have a choice, then this is

31:38.400 --> 31:44.720
 going to become that risk benefit of, are you going to risk getting COVID, or are you going to risk

31:44.720 --> 31:50.720
 potentially having arrhythmia cardiac issues after that? That's a tough call, and I see why

31:50.720 --> 31:55.280
 they're saying you should go see a physician, you should see a cardiologist. They can get to the

31:55.280 --> 31:59.920
 root of this. Hopefully, they can even get a sense of whether or not it makes logical sense

31:59.920 --> 32:04.320
 them. This is related. I mean, the five days after, there's that sort of causal suggestion.

32:05.040 --> 32:10.000
 And I have to say, this could be the last sort of is the Delta variant. What is the only good thing

32:10.000 --> 32:14.480
 about the Delta variant is we actually are seeing an uptick in people coming and saying, you know,

32:14.480 --> 32:18.240
 I wasn't going to get vaccinated. But now with everything I'm reading about the Delta variant

32:18.240 --> 32:23.440
 in the media echo chamber, I'm not a huge fan of the end justifies the means. I think we need to

32:23.440 --> 32:27.680
 be honest. But I'm always happy to hear people coming in and getting vaccinated.

32:27.680 --> 32:32.240
 My, my view, Daniel, is that at least people stopped using the word strain. They're using

32:32.240 --> 32:39.440
 variant that. Okay, we'll take what we can, Vince. All right, Ken writes, I've just watched a

32:39.440 --> 32:43.920
 presentation where several medical doctors have hypothesized based on clinical studies

32:44.480 --> 32:49.440
 that long haul COVID is caused by the presence of nonclassical monocytes containing S1 protein

32:49.440 --> 32:54.880
 fragments located on a Neil epithelial cells of blood vessels. These cells apparently engender

32:54.880 --> 32:59.840
 various inflammatory conditions in the vascular system, presenting as common symptoms of long

32:59.840 --> 33:04.880
 COVID. The doctors have also presented evidence from their own practice that the use of statins

33:04.880 --> 33:10.160
 and Ivermectin have benefited patients by presumably shutting down over active monocytes or somehow

33:10.160 --> 33:15.040
 blocking the effect of residual S1. I'm not a doctor or scientist, but I would love to hear

33:15.040 --> 33:20.720
 your thoughts on this hypothesis. Yeah, so I'm going to comment. I hope those physicians didn't

33:20.720 --> 33:25.200
 use the word evidence when they were describing their anecdotes, their clinical anecdotes.

33:26.240 --> 33:30.800
 You know, the way science is supposed to work, and I really am a little troubled by what happened

33:30.800 --> 33:36.720
 during the COVID-19 pandemic is you may make some observations in the clinic. And that's really

33:36.720 --> 33:42.400
 what drives you to say we need to study this. We need to find out if it's true. It is very easy

33:42.400 --> 33:51.040
 to be tricked by our observations, by our selective memory of things. And so normally you would have

33:51.040 --> 33:57.120
 a theory. You might do some basic science to get a sense of whether or not that's true. If that

33:57.120 --> 34:02.480
 seems consistent, then you would look at a small trial to get a sense. Then you would talk to your

34:02.480 --> 34:06.400
 statisticians about how many people do we need to have in this trial? Because you don't willy

34:06.400 --> 34:12.960
 nilly start giving medicines to lots of people. Unfortunately, the last 18 months has been sort

34:12.960 --> 34:19.360
 of the Wild West. I'm hoping we're getting away from influencers, thought leaders, spreading

34:19.360 --> 34:24.080
 Atlantic Dodes. I think we got to get back to science. And what is science? Science is really

34:24.080 --> 34:29.920
 just asking in a way that you can find out the truth. What works? What does it work? And then

34:29.920 --> 34:33.920
 the risk benefit of making different choices and different recommendations for our patients.

34:33.920 --> 34:39.920
 What is it that Mark Chris lip says, the three most dangerous word that a doctor says?

34:41.120 --> 34:48.320
 In my experience. There you go. And I like to say the plural of anecdote is not data.

34:49.440 --> 34:55.360
 That's a good one. That's a good one too. Ken, by the way, said he had long whole COVID in November

34:55.360 --> 35:01.920
 and then it got better after his first dose of Moderna. That's fantastic. No, I mean, we are

35:01.920 --> 35:07.520
 seeing that. I know Akiko up at Yale is working on studying this but having issues recruiting enough

35:07.520 --> 35:14.400
 patients. So we are seeing this. It's nice that we had this UK investigation. Just more support,

35:14.400 --> 35:18.080
 right? And again, this is an issue. We have observations in the clinic. We have to do these

35:18.080 --> 35:23.360
 informal ways to really turn those anecdotes into information. All right, one more from Danielle.

35:23.360 --> 35:33.120
 I think we covered this but Danielle got her first J&J in April and then decided to get a dose of

35:33.120 --> 35:40.960
 Pfizer and listened to your podcast last week about a person who got two more doses of a vaccine

35:40.960 --> 35:45.280
 even after Sputnik. And she wants to know is whether it's safe to go ahead, get the second

35:45.280 --> 35:49.840
 Pfizer dose or whether I would be subjecting my immune system to too much immune stimulation.

35:49.840 --> 35:54.480
 Yeah, I think there's two topics here to touch on. We'll start with the safety issue, right?

35:55.200 --> 36:00.240
 You know, the US as far as recognizing someone is fully vaccinated, there's the list of not only

36:00.240 --> 36:08.080
 EUA, so US FDA, EUA approved, but also now WHO approved vaccines and you look at that list.

36:08.080 --> 36:12.240
 And if you completed the series, you can be considered, recognized, all the rights and

36:12.240 --> 36:17.280
 privileges of being fully vaccinated. But we're certainly, we certainly have seen a lot of

36:17.280 --> 36:23.760
 individuals that didn't meet that criteria and ended up getting a couple more doses of a US FDA

36:23.760 --> 36:29.200
 EUA approved vaccine, even though they already had received some other unrecognized unapproved

36:29.200 --> 36:35.040
 vaccine outside the country. So from a safety point of view, not been formally studied,

36:35.040 --> 36:39.120
 we do now have experience with thousands of individuals who have gone through this. We're

36:39.120 --> 36:43.600
 not seeing any reports in VAERS or anything else. So from a safety standpoint, I'm not concerned,

36:43.600 --> 36:48.800
 but I am concerned about the logic here, right? The JJ is a very effective vaccine for doing what

36:48.800 --> 36:54.880
