 This week in virology, the podcast about viruses, the kind that make you sick.

00:10.480 --> 00:21.440
 From MicrobeTV, this is Twiv. This week in virology, episode number 800, recorded on September 2nd, 2021.

00:22.000 --> 00:28.240
 I'm Vincent Rackeniello, and you're listening to the podcast all about viruses. Joining me today

00:28.240 --> 00:36.240
 from New York, Daniel Griffin. Hello, everyone. Well, there's no airplane that's 800, but that's a

00:36.240 --> 00:42.240
 pretty good number for this episode. Daniel, congratulations. Yeah, I like 800. I'm happy with

00:42.240 --> 00:47.360
 this. I only wish the clinical update had been 80. We should have timed it, so it's

00:47.360 --> 00:52.320
 clinical update 78, but it's episode 800, so. I don't know. I think we're going to be doing

00:52.320 --> 00:57.360
 this for some time, don't you, Daniel? Yeah, I'm going to do the Anthony Fauci thing where I just

00:57.360 --> 01:02.160
 put my hand in my face and say, Oh, my gosh, it's two years into this. And yeah, you know, you

01:02.160 --> 01:07.840
 started, I think went in the five hundredths, right? Yes, five hundredths. And yeah, I would not be

01:07.840 --> 01:12.640
 surprised if we're not hitting a thousand, you know, and the pandemic is still something we're

01:12.640 --> 01:18.960
 talking about is still trying to get through. I remember your, your, I'm sorry, just one more

01:18.960 --> 01:23.920
 thing. I remember your first clinical reports were from your car in the hospital parking lot,

01:23.920 --> 01:28.640
 remember? I remember that. And then I was like trying to do it in the stairwell, but I was worried

01:28.640 --> 01:33.760
 that there was like a crack under the door and the whole ICU had been turned into a theoretical

01:33.760 --> 01:40.080
 negative pressure. And so yeah, it's quite a ways. But all right, let's jump in. We have a lot to do

01:40.080 --> 01:45.600
 today. And Vincent, you jump in at any point, because I'm going to touch on a few controversial

01:45.600 --> 01:51.920
 things. All right. So I'm expecting a lot, a lot of hate mail. Like to get that. Oh, you must be

01:51.920 --> 01:54.960
 saying Ivermectin, right? Yeah, we're going to talk about Ivermectin.

01:56.720 --> 02:03.920
 So let me return to Winston Churchill. I feel like I'm sort of back in the Winston Churchill

02:04.480 --> 02:11.600
 sort of mood. A fanatic is one who can't change his mind and won't change the subject.

02:12.320 --> 02:19.200
 So we'll figure out who the fanatic is if it's me or if it's, you know, people that I try to talk

02:19.200 --> 02:26.000
 to, you know, I like to keep saying a single point does not make a line. We do keep learning. We do

02:26.000 --> 02:31.280
 keep moving forward. So I think people can take a deep breath. You're not going to wake up tomorrow

02:31.280 --> 02:36.240
 and find out that, you know, everything we've thought to date is completely wrong. But I'm

02:36.240 --> 02:42.560
 going to talk about a number of items right up front. Ivermectin and convalescent plasma.

02:43.200 --> 02:48.000
 So Ivermectin has been in the news a lot lately. And I've actually been getting a lot of calls,

02:48.000 --> 02:54.240
 a lot of questions about it. And, you know, I think early on, I sort of said that this was

02:54.240 --> 02:59.120
 going to happen. And what did I say was going to happen? We are two years into this pandemic.

02:59.120 --> 03:05.360
 And we still do not have really clear data on the role of Ivermectin in COVID-19.

03:05.360 --> 03:10.640
 We certainly do not know what a correct dose or timing might be if someone wants to use this.

03:11.680 --> 03:16.640
 And I am going to say this, you know, the way the media sort of portrays us, I'm going to challenge.

03:16.640 --> 03:22.640
 You know, there are certain individuals that I know who are looking at studies out there.

03:22.640 --> 03:28.640
 And they they are themselves convinced by the data. I am not convinced by the data for Ivermectin

03:28.640 --> 03:36.160
 or is the FDA. But what I think we're all on the same page with is that you should not be using

03:36.160 --> 03:42.000
 your horses, your dogs, animal preparations of Ivermectin. I don't think there's any, you know,

03:42.000 --> 03:48.080
 any physician that I know or respect who would be advocating that. And even the frontline COVID

03:48.080 --> 03:53.520
 critical care alliance, which has been, I'll say, supportive of Ivermectin, they actually came

03:53.520 --> 03:59.680
 out with a statement on August 27th, very clearly stating. This is from them. We support the FDA's

03:59.680 --> 04:06.080
 direction that humans should never take medication formulations meant for animals. We also agree

04:06.080 --> 04:10.320
 that self-dosing of medications without the guidance of a physician is potentially dangerous

04:10.320 --> 04:16.400
 and could cause serious harm. So, you know, please stop stealing your dogs, your horses,

04:16.400 --> 04:22.720
 or your other animals, deworming medication. You know, it did occur to me, do we deworm cats,

04:22.720 --> 04:28.160
 apparently indoor cats don't need to be dewormed. But, you know, you should deworm your dogs.

04:29.120 --> 04:33.440
 But we currently do not have the data to know if there is a role for Ivermectin

04:33.440 --> 04:38.000
 the treatment of COVID-19. And this has created a vacuum. And I think that's what I talked about,

04:38.000 --> 04:44.800
 you know, really about two years ago is Ivermectin is one of the most prescribed and used medications

04:44.800 --> 04:51.360
 for people with COVID. And until we really get clear data, that's going to continue. Just, you know,

04:51.360 --> 04:57.040
 physicians have the ability to use medications off label. People, as we're seeing, have the ability

04:57.040 --> 05:05.040
 to get stuff that they feel that social media is supporting. There are a number of large trials

05:05.040 --> 05:10.960
 trying to address this question, right? So in the US, I've talked about this, we have the ACTIV-6

05:10.960 --> 05:17.040
 trial. There's the COVID-out trial being run by a friend of mine at University of Minnesota,

05:17.040 --> 05:22.880
 the UK, they have the principal trial. There's a lot of trials. You know, this is the way we

05:22.880 --> 05:30.000
 move forward in medicine. Science, it's not nothing mysterious. It's really you in a non-biased way.

05:30.000 --> 05:36.240
 Ask the question, do people do better with or without a certain therapeutic? So if people are

05:36.240 --> 05:41.280
 excited about Ivermectin, and actually did, I emailed Paul Merrick and Pierre Corey, who I know

05:41.280 --> 05:46.000
 know well, and he said, hey, maybe on the front of your website, you can actually add ways for

05:46.000 --> 05:50.960
 patients to connect with clinical trials. That's really, you know, sort of where I'm going to go

05:50.960 --> 05:55.760
 with that. Do you have a comment there, Vincent? So what do you tell people, Daniel, who

05:55.760 --> 06:02.560
 right all the time, well, I took Ivermectin and I got better? You know, this goes back to the

06:02.560 --> 06:07.920
 three most dangerous words, right? You know, in my experience, right? You can't string anecdotes.

06:08.480 --> 06:14.080
 The plot of anecdotes is not data. You know, most people, right, with COVID get better.

06:14.080 --> 06:18.720
 Most people that didn't take Ivermectin get better. Most people that took Ivermectin get better.

06:18.720 --> 06:23.840
 The question is, if you took Ivermectin, did that increase your chance of getting better?

06:23.840 --> 06:28.880
 And there actually is, you know, a problem now, and I'm going to actually, I think I'm going to

06:28.880 --> 06:34.880
 bring up the CDC page. There's a bunch of individuals who have had some really horrible

06:34.880 --> 06:43.520
 experiences with Ivermectin. And there's actually a CDC brief that they sent out sort of an alert

06:43.520 --> 06:48.480
 with actually described cases. There was an adult who drank an injectable Ivermectin formulation

06:48.480 --> 06:54.400
 intended for use and cattle. They presented a hospital to confusion, drowsiness, hallucinations,

06:54.400 --> 07:00.160
 to kypnea, tremors. They ended up being hospitalized. There was another individual who ended up with

07:00.160 --> 07:05.120
 altered mental status after taking Ivermectin tablets of unknown strength purchased on the

07:05.120 --> 07:11.600
 internet. So I think that we have to really be clear here. This is not something, you know,

07:11.600 --> 07:16.880
 if something works, it might have side effects. And so it's really a balance, you know, drink your

07:16.880 --> 07:22.560
 tap water and okay, there's no side effects there, but there's also no efficacy. So yeah,

07:23.520 --> 07:27.840
 you know, and I often get patients who ask me, you know, Dr. Griffin, would you recommend Ivermectin?

07:27.840 --> 07:32.640
 And I think, as people well know, prior to the pandemic, I was one of the few physicians in the

07:32.640 --> 07:40.000
 country with my focus in parasitology using Ivermectin for strong alloydies, for scabies. And we even

07:40.000 --> 07:45.440
 had a case of a gentleman at Yale who got way too much steroids and ended up with the strong

07:45.440 --> 07:50.000
 alloydies hyperinfection. So yeah, Ivermectin has a certain role in certain patients. We have

07:50.000 --> 07:54.240
 yet to have the level of data that I would consider compelling that the FDA would consider

07:54.240 --> 07:59.600
 compelling that whatever side effects are outweighed by any benefit. And convalescent plasma, I'm

07:59.600 --> 08:04.880
 throwing this right in here at the same time. You know, we still have people that are very

08:04.880 --> 08:10.160
 excited about convalescent plasma. And I just really want to say here, the data is in, right? So,

08:10.800 --> 08:14.480
 you know, I don't want to prove me wrong. I've said with Ivermectin, we didn't do the trials,

08:14.480 --> 08:19.680
 we're still waiting for clear guidance. Convalescent plasma, we spent billions of dollars. The data

08:19.680 --> 08:26.480
 is in. And the ID Society of America, the IDSA really has made it clear in their recommendations

08:26.480 --> 08:31.920
 based upon the science of recommendation number eight from the IDSA for COVID treatment. Among

08:31.920 --> 08:38.720
 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, the IDSA guideline panel suggests against COVID-19 convalescent

08:38.720 --> 08:45.040
 plasma in the outpatient setting. Okay, they still say it's reasonable to consider clinical trials,

08:45.040 --> 08:49.840
 but not using it outside. And it doesn't matter to me. This, you know, if you get your, you know,

08:49.840 --> 08:56.640
 your local B-produced artisanal plasma, the data does not support. I mean, I understand the passion.

08:57.200 --> 09:04.000
 People are excited. The data is in. This does not really have a role in the treatment of COVID-19.

09:04.000 --> 09:10.880
 All right. So make sure I get those. What are they? Mail those Daniel at microbe.tv.

09:10.880 --> 09:19.920
 That's right. All right. Children COVID, mental health. Now, children are at risk if they get

09:19.920 --> 09:24.560
 COVID. I think that is now really clear. And I keep saying wearing a mask is less dramatic for

09:24.560 --> 09:30.480
 childhood being hospitalized. I'm going to throw in here, not only children, but pregnant women,

09:30.480 --> 09:36.560
 women who are about to have children. You know, and I've been asked actually to give an update on

09:36.560 --> 09:41.920
 pregnancy and COVID-19. And we certainly have much more data now than I was first asked this

09:41.920 --> 09:47.440
 question live on CNN back in March 2020. When they prepped me, I would be talking about the

09:47.440 --> 09:53.520
 president and testing and then boom. Dr. Griffin, tell us about pregnant women in COVID.

09:55.280 --> 09:58.240
 Said that seems a little bit different than what we were going to discuss. But anyway,

09:58.240 --> 10:02.880
 the article characteristics, oh, I was wearing the same bow tie. So just to bring everyone back

10:02.880 --> 10:09.760
 to that day, I'll mess with it. The article characteristics and outcomes of women with COVID-19

10:09.760 --> 10:16.960
 giving birth at US academic centers during the COVID-19 pandemic was published in as a

10:16.960 --> 10:23.360
 peer reviewed article in JAMA Network Open. And I think it really gives us a solid overview of how

10:23.360 --> 10:30.800
 devastating COVID-19 can be for pregnant women. For some time, we've been encouraging vaccination

10:30.800 --> 10:37.200
 before, during, after pregnancy. And here's a little bit of data. Not only do we know it's safe,

10:38.000 --> 10:44.240
 but what is driving this? What can happen if a pregnant person gets infected with COVID? So

10:44.240 --> 10:50.320
 this was a retrospective cohort study. They looked at 869,079 adult women

10:50.320 --> 11:00.480
 within this cohort, 18,715 of the women had COVID-19. And they found what did they find? The women

11:00.480 --> 11:06.720
 with COVID-19, the pregnant women with COVID-19 were more likely, if they got infected with COVID-19,

11:06.720 --> 11:13.680
 right, to have a preterm birth, right? So the negative impact on the baby, significantly higher

11:13.680 --> 11:22.240
 rates of ICU admission, significant odds of ending up getting intubated, mechanical ventilation,

11:22.240 --> 11:28.560
 that was up by about 14-fold. And they were 15 times as likely to die if they ended up in the

11:28.560 --> 11:35.120
 hospital, right? So these are vaccine preventable tragedies for the mothers and the babies. And

11:35.120 --> 11:40.720
 as per the CDC numbers, we are seeing over a thousand new infections per week in pregnant

11:40.720 --> 11:46.720
 people, right? So these are vaccine preventable tragedies. So pregnant women, they should get

11:46.720 --> 11:51.520
 vaccinated. Don't wait for any particular trimester. The earlier in the pregnancy,

11:52.320 --> 11:55.840
 the better chance that they're going to have the ability to not only protect themselves,

11:55.840 --> 12:00.960
 the unborn child, but also when that child is born, the ability to pass those 80 bodies.

12:02.880 --> 12:07.280
 I also want everyone to suggest people bookmark on their computer. I have a few things that I

12:07.280 --> 12:12.080
 bookmark, you know, where I keep track of what's going on. And one of the things that I bookmark

12:12.080 --> 12:20.960
 is the AAP children and COVID-19 state level data. And this is where they keep track of what's

12:20.960 --> 12:26.800
 happening in children. And we are now seeing thousands of children each week, thousands of

12:26.800 --> 12:33.760
 children each week are being hospitalized for COVID-19. And if you look at that greater than 100,000

12:33.760 --> 12:37.920
 people in the US that are currently in the hospital, paying on which state you look at,

12:37.920 --> 12:42.800
 that's sort of two to four percent of those hospitalized individuals are children.

12:43.840 --> 12:49.200
 So, you know, if not for yourself, get vaccinated and engage in behaviors to protect our children.

12:49.920 --> 12:54.000
 And remember, wearing a mask is less dramatic for a child than being hospitalized. So

12:55.840 --> 12:59.440
 there was, I'm going to throw this in in this section, and it was where they were looking about

12:59.440 --> 13:06.480
 long COVID in children. And I was a little shocked, I guess, confused by the BBC News

13:06.480 --> 13:11.600
 interpretation of this. So let me go through the pre-print that the BBC News was talking about.

13:11.600 --> 13:18.160
 And this was the pre-print long COVID, the physical and mental health of children and non-hospitalized

13:18.160 --> 13:24.480
 young people three months after SARS-CoV-2 infection, a national matched cohort study,

13:24.480 --> 13:32.640
 the clock study. So this is a pre-print under review. This was a cohort study of test positive

13:33.440 --> 13:38.400
 compared to age, sex, and geographically matched test negative children.

13:39.120 --> 13:44.480
 And what they did here is these children completed detailed questionnaires,

13:45.680 --> 13:50.400
 three months post this positive test or post not having a positive test.

13:50.400 --> 13:55.360
 And this is a challenging paper, I'll be honest. You can imagine if you have an adolescent child

13:56.000 --> 14:00.880
 and you start asking them how they feel, there's a lot of background here. So it's really a challenge

14:02.240 --> 14:06.240
 sorting out what might be going on relative to background. There's also the challenge here that

14:06.240 --> 14:13.200
 there's no universally agreed upon definition of long COVID. And I like to say long COVID is really

14:13.200 --> 14:20.640
 a subset of post-acute sequelae of COVID. It's sort of a chronic syndrome where

14:20.640 --> 14:26.240
 past includes things like new diagnosis of diabetes, new diagnosis of stroke, other things in there.

14:27.040 --> 14:32.480
 And it really was one of the tables that I wanted to go through. So if you go through

14:32.480 --> 14:38.080
 this study, and I'm going to encourage people to go ahead and spend some time, hopefully we'll

14:38.080 --> 14:44.720
 post this. But they have a really nice table, table three. And here you can look at the different

14:44.720 --> 14:49.200
 issues. And I did not find this reassuring. So they asked a number of questions. So one of the

14:49.200 --> 14:56.960
 big things we see in long COVID in all ages is this just incredible amount of fatigue. In the

14:56.960 --> 15:04.640
 negative, that was 3.3. Three months out, it was still 22.7% of the children were reporting that.

15:04.640 --> 15:11.600
 Shortness of breath, 1.5 up to 11.6. 20% of them still couldn't smell. And that was rare.

15:11.600 --> 15:14.480
 That was only about one and a half percent in the negative group.

15:17.040 --> 15:24.800
 Headaches, right? 4.8% background. This was 26.3%. At three months after

15:24.800 --> 15:30.080
 acute COVID in these children. Unusually strong muscle pains, right? A lot of people have these

15:30.080 --> 15:36.800
 muscle pains. That was about 1% background. It was 11% in these children at three months.

15:36.800 --> 15:44.160
 So I was not reassured when the BBC said, oh, it's much lower than that 80% we were fearing.

15:44.720 --> 15:51.120
 I was quite concerned when I'm seeing such high prevalence, three months out of symptoms in these

15:51.120 --> 15:56.800
 children. So just to repeat, COVID is a problem in children. They may not die of COVID.

15:56.800 --> 16:01.760
 They may be at lower risk of ending up in the hospital than adults, maybe in the one or two

16:01.760 --> 16:06.480
 percent of them. But boy, this is a large chunk of kids three months out still suffering.

16:06.480 --> 16:12.320
 Transmission, testing, never miss an opportunity to test. Here, there's a bunch of things I feel

16:12.320 --> 16:18.560
 like I'm saying over and over again. There was a preprint here. Actually, it wasn't a preprint.

16:18.560 --> 16:25.120
 It was published in the MMWR. As much as people criticize the CDC, you'll find out I discuss a

16:25.120 --> 16:31.920
 lot of MMWR papers. So kudos to the people at the CDC who keep getting this information out there.

16:31.920 --> 16:35.360
 And this, I thought, was very interesting. It was sort of one of several publications

16:35.360 --> 16:44.000
 along this line that I saw this last week. And this was outbreak associated with SARS-CoV-2-B1617.2,

16:44.000 --> 16:51.280
 the Delta variant, in an elementary school, Marin County, California. And one of the things I really

16:51.280 --> 16:57.600
 liked about this was they showed a seeding map, right? And this is where we have an unvaccinated,

16:57.600 --> 17:04.240
 symptomatic, infected teacher who does what I see all the time, right? When someone wants to talk,

17:04.240 --> 17:08.800
 when they want to generate all those droplets and aerosols, they pull off the mast, right? She

17:08.800 --> 17:14.560
 wants to read to the children. And so she was unmasked reading aloud to the class, the majority

17:14.560 --> 17:21.280
 of the kids got infected. Everyone in the front row, most of the kids in the second row, yeah,

17:21.280 --> 17:28.000
 you really wanted to be in the back. So really, really tough when we talk about, you know,

17:28.000 --> 17:33.840
 masking and vaccination in these settings. All right, well, what about testing, right?

17:34.560 --> 17:38.880
 Think of, I feel like I go through this talk every time, and I do it every week, every week on

17:38.880 --> 17:44.800
 Wednesdays, I do like a COVID clinical update for all our urgent care centers in the tri-state area,

17:44.800 --> 17:52.400
 and about 250, 300 providers tune into these. And, you know, it's still shocking to me that

17:52.400 --> 17:57.520
 this far into the pandemic, there's still so much misinformation about testing. Now, I will say

17:57.520 --> 18:01.920
 that pro New York, Riverside, care amount, pro health, Connecticut, all these parts of Optum

18:01.920 --> 18:08.400
 tri-state have really invested heavily in creating access to COVID-19 tests. And each week, a chunk

18:08.400 --> 18:14.560
 of my week has spent addressing questions. And one of the biggest challenges, understanding what's

18:14.560 --> 18:20.240
 the best test, and whether or not there are certain situations when you may do more than one test.

18:20.240 --> 18:27.120
 So the research letter, validation of an at home, at home, direct antigen rapid test for COVID-19,

18:27.120 --> 18:32.480
 was published in JAMA Network Open. And I know it's been quite a while since we first sort of

18:32.480 --> 18:40.560
 looked at this idea of people having the ability to test themselves at home with rapid tests.

18:40.560 --> 18:46.320
 So this study, I think, really builds on things that we keep talking about. This idea that we

18:46.320 --> 18:51.840
 talked about last week, that the peak of contagiousness and perhaps the majority of all transmission

18:51.840 --> 18:57.120
 from infected individual occurs in the two days prior and the three days following the onset of

18:57.120 --> 19:03.440
 symptoms. So during that period of time when there's a very high level of viral RNA load,

19:03.440 --> 19:10.160
 when there's a very high level of antigen. So here the investigators follow 257 individuals,

19:10.160 --> 19:16.160
 self-collecting nasal swab specimens twice weekly at home during a six-month period.

19:16.960 --> 19:22.880
 The investigators were studying a real-world implementation of this high-frequency testing,

19:22.880 --> 19:30.640
 using an inexpensive at home, self-administered direct antigen rapid test. So the DART,

19:30.640 --> 19:38.080
 D-A-R-T, direct antigen rapid test. And they were then using RTPCR as a comparison.

19:38.880 --> 19:43.040
 Now remember, these are individuals, these are not medical experts, these are just people

19:43.040 --> 19:48.640
 taking swabs and sticking them up their noses. The individual self-collected these during this

19:48.640 --> 19:57.920
 six-month period, the DART sensitivity for that zero to three days was 96.3%. I know a lot of

19:57.920 --> 20:04.480
 people keep talking about antigens being low sensitivity tests. If you're looking for someone

20:04.480 --> 20:12.720
 who is infectious, who is capable of transmission, 96.3% is not low sensitivity in my book.

20:12.720 --> 20:19.040
 Even if you really stretch this out to zero to 12 days after symptom onset, when we're really

20:19.040 --> 20:27.040
 starting to get past the point, there's still we're 78.9% sensitive. So I sort of want to even

20:27.040 --> 20:32.960
 challenge this concept that antigen tests have an issue with sensitivity. They actually have

20:32.960 --> 20:38.800
 great sensitivity if the question is, is this person acutely infected and potentially contagious?

20:38.800 --> 20:47.040
 So this does feed into that experience that don't think the plural of anecdotes is data,

20:47.040 --> 20:52.560
 because you will when a person comes in, if you do this test, you're going to pick up most people

20:52.560 --> 20:56.720
 who are contagious right away within 15 minutes. You're going to be able to pull them out of

20:56.720 --> 21:03.040
 circulation before transmission. But there will be a certain number of people who you're catching

21:03.040 --> 21:09.360
 either prior to becoming contagious, or you're catching after that. And I will certainly say,

21:09.360 --> 21:13.200
 when we're in the hospital, we're looking for a higher sensitivity test, because we're really

21:13.200 --> 21:19.760
 asking the question, did you get infected a week or two ago? Because we're usually seeing them

21:19.760 --> 21:25.760
 when they're showing up during that early inflammatory phase. So one of the things that I say is,

21:25.760 --> 21:30.720
 don't miss an opportunity test. But I guess I'm going to say, don't miss an opportunity to rapidly

21:30.720 --> 21:36.160
 get an answer and intervene. If you want to throw a PCR in as a second test, you know,

21:36.160 --> 21:40.960
 that's going to make sense in certain situations. And also a test does not predict the future,

21:40.960 --> 21:46.080
 right? So you get exposed on Saturday, you have a negative test on Sunday, I would expect that.

21:46.080 --> 21:49.760
 You're not going to really start turning positive until about four days later.

21:50.640 --> 21:57.280
 Okay, another preprint just posted today, hot off the preprint press. And this really helps

21:57.280 --> 22:02.480
 continue along the slides of connecting dots about what happens when a vaccinated person gets

22:02.480 --> 22:10.480
 infected with SARS-CoV-2. And this was longitudinal analysis of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine breakthrough

22:10.480 --> 22:15.840
 infections reveal limited infectious viral shedding and restrict tissue distribution.

22:16.720 --> 22:22.640
 Now, the authors reported on viral dynamics and infectious virus shedding through daily

22:22.640 --> 22:29.040
 longitudinal sampling in a small cohort of adults infected with SARS-CoV-2 at various stages of

22:29.040 --> 22:36.000
 vaccination, right? So not vaccinated, one dose, two doses. This paper is still binary in terms of

22:36.880 --> 22:41.280
 being able to culture virus or not, right? So it doesn't have that quantification that we would

22:41.280 --> 22:49.360
 like. But they did report that vaccinated individuals were less likely to test viral culture positive

22:49.360 --> 22:55.680
 and that the decay of the viral RNA load was more rapid in vaccinated individuals.

22:56.320 --> 23:01.360
 And they also have nice data, again, on antigen tests correlating with the ability to culture

23:01.360 --> 23:07.680
 virus. Really continuing to support that narrative, that antigen tests are a great way to jump in

23:07.680 --> 23:12.640
 and pick up those people during that infectious period when they're capable of transmitting

23:12.640 --> 23:20.480
 virus. And that was in figure one G of this, which I think is worth reading. All right, active

23:20.480 --> 23:25.600
 vaccination, never missed an opportunity to vaccinate. And yes, vaccination is how this

23:25.600 --> 23:33.040
 pandemic ends. This is actually, I would say this is a pearl. I get this question every so often,

23:33.040 --> 23:37.280
 and perhaps our listeners do not realize we have a lot of clinicians that listen. But also,

23:37.280 --> 23:41.120
 maybe we have some people still waiting to get vaccinated or maybe people getting ready to get

23:41.120 --> 23:48.480
 that third dose. COVID vaccinations don't necessarily have to go in the deltoid. You can actually,

23:48.480 --> 23:54.320
 as for the CDC, the anterior lateral thigh can be used. They actually have a nice table,

23:54.320 --> 24:00.080
 a 1.5 inch needle may be used if administering the vaccine in this site in the anterior lateral

24:00.080 --> 24:05.520
 thigh. Sort of encourage people not to stick needles in the behind. You've got nerves,

24:05.520 --> 24:10.720
 blood vessels, the lateral thigh. That's the modern place if you don't want to go into the deltoid.

24:11.600 --> 24:18.640
 All right. And why did my pediatrician always give it in my butt? That was that was old school. I

24:18.640 --> 24:23.600
 have to bet. Actually, you know, it's funny, I was in the Dominican Republic when this came up.

24:23.600 --> 24:27.760
 And in certain parts of the world, people have a lower body mass than in the US. So you actually

24:27.760 --> 24:34.240
 see about 1% of the time in some of these populations, you're causing complications. So maybe you had,

24:34.240 --> 24:41.040
 you know, I don't know, adequate butt tissue there. But yeah, we've tried to, if you look at the

24:41.040 --> 24:47.920
 science on this, it's probably better off to move away from the tail. Okay. Well, we've entered a

24:47.920 --> 24:52.640
 period that I'm going to call the Battle of the Vaccines. I see t-shirts on the horizon,

24:52.640 --> 24:58.240
 you know, the spike backs and the comeritity t-shirts. But people all want to know, you know,

24:58.240 --> 25:04.960
 what is the best vaccine, you know, and what team are you on? And the first, this peer-reviewed

25:04.960 --> 25:10.960
 publication that I will talk about, comparison of SARS-CoV-2 antibody response following vaccination

25:10.960 --> 25:21.680
 with BNT-162B2 and mRNA-1273. So that's the Pfizer or the comeritity and the spike backs or the

25:21.680 --> 25:26.720
 Moderna. And you know, everyone keeps telling us don't look at the antibody titers. But what did

25:26.720 --> 25:31.920
 they do? They looked at the antibody titers. And they're twice as high after the Moderna shot.

25:31.920 --> 25:40.720
 So of course, we all want to get the Moderna shot now. We also had another pre-print. I got

25:40.720 --> 25:46.960
 spike backs, the Moderna, by the way, just saying, comparison of two highly effective mRNA vaccines

25:46.960 --> 25:53.280
 for COVID-19 during periods of alpha and delta variant prevalence. And here, they're actually

25:53.280 --> 25:59.600
 reporting on what they say is effectiveness, now what does that mean, of the mRNA vaccines.

25:59.600 --> 26:04.160
 So what they say here, they look at data from the Mayo Clinic health system,

26:05.040 --> 26:11.920
 this period January to July of 2021. We had different variants, you know, alpha and then delta

26:11.920 --> 26:18.560
 variant. So first, the reassuring data, right? Both vaccines continue to be highly effective

26:18.560 --> 26:25.760
 during this period. Again, SARS-CoV-2 associated hospitalizations. We're looking at 91.6%. We're

26:25.760 --> 26:33.920
 looking at 85%. Even when you go into July, right? Still 81%, still 75%. But then they throw in the

26:33.920 --> 26:41.440
 new superpower comparison, vaccine effectiveness against infection. And here they say 76% for the

26:41.440 --> 26:49.600
 Moderna spike backs, and only 42% for the community Pfizer folks. And then they go ahead. And of

26:49.600 --> 26:55.840
 course, just to make it worse, this is a twofold risk reduction against quote unquote breakthrough

26:55.840 --> 27:01.840
 infection. They speculate on mRNA content. And Vincent, do you have any comments about this?

27:01.840 --> 27:06.400
 Oh, why don't we care about infection? Don't we care just about disease in particular serious

27:06.400 --> 27:11.680
 disease? You know, that's an interesting question. And I'm going to the one thing I will say, right?

27:11.680 --> 27:16.640
 And I think in general, this is a new thing we're asking vaccines to do we're asking about.

27:16.640 --> 27:21.200
 And we're going to get to a study where we look at what if you're vaccinated and you get an

27:21.200 --> 27:26.560
 infection, you don't end up in the hospital. What about your risk of long COVID? Do people who are

27:26.560 --> 27:31.600
 vaccinated get long COVID? So that I'm going to hold on to that thought because I'm going to talk a

27:31.600 --> 27:36.240
 little bit about because that that is going to potentially raise an issue because that is disease,

27:36.240 --> 27:42.080
 right? Long COVID is disease. And are the vaccines protecting against that? All right. So passive

27:42.080 --> 27:48.480
 vaccination, right? We have a developing story here. So passive vaccination is ideally getting

27:48.480 --> 27:57.360
 something a monoclonal and anybody as prophylaxis. So we we got the the ProVent phase three prophylaxis

27:57.360 --> 28:02.960
 trial results. They met their primary endpoint. The data was announced. So this was a trial that

28:02.960 --> 28:14.480
 included 5197 participants in a two to one randomization to receive this AZD7442 to monoclonal

28:14.480 --> 28:21.680
 cocktail or placebo. This is still at the press release stage. They do report that you know,

28:21.680 --> 28:26.640
 most of these individuals had comorbidities, right? So putting them at higher risk. And then

28:26.640 --> 28:31.920
 they report that this combination reduced the risk of developing symptomatic COVID-19

28:31.920 --> 28:41.360
 by 77% compared to placebo. No cases of severe COVID-19 or COVID-19 related deaths in those treated.

28:42.080 --> 28:46.720
 In the placebo arm, there were three cases of severe COVID-19. There were two deaths.

28:48.000 --> 28:52.800
 So I keep keep pushing on and this I've actually seen a number of emails, number of alerts from

28:52.800 --> 28:58.720
 the Catholic health system, which I really applaud. So if my buddies over there are listening,

28:59.680 --> 29:04.960
 it's been added as an order set. We send folks over your high risk individual. You've had an

29:04.960 --> 29:10.880
 exposure. We get these individuals monoclonals prophylactically. Regeneron actually has

29:10.880 --> 29:16.640
 EUA expansion for this. But unfortunately, right, only about a third of eligible patients are getting

29:16.640 --> 29:24.560
 this highly effective therapy. If someone is vaccinated, it doesn't matter. If someone is pregnant,

29:24.560 --> 29:28.720
 actually, as I think we've discussed, that puts them in a high risk category. And they would be

29:28.720 --> 29:37.040
 eligible for this as well. Okay. Now the period of viral replication, but I like to say the time

29:37.040 --> 29:42.800
 for monitoring and monoclonals, not the time for antibiotics. And I've talked previously,

29:42.800 --> 29:48.880
 and I hit on this early on the active six trial, which is a COVID-19 study of repurposed drugs.

29:48.880 --> 29:55.680
 And David Faginbaum was on Twiv 766 talking a little bit about this whole concept of trying to

29:55.680 --> 30:01.120
 find stuff on the shelf that might be potentially helpful. This trial is going to investigate

30:01.120 --> 30:07.520
 Ivermectin, inhaled flu ticazone, and flu voxamine. So what, what is flu voxamine, right? We've all

30:07.520 --> 30:12.720
 heard about Ivermectin, a lot about Ivermectin. We've all heard about steroids like dexamethasone,

30:12.720 --> 30:17.600
 here is an inhaled formulation. But what is flu voxamine? Now, flu voxamine is a I'm going to say

30:17.600 --> 30:26.080
 a Prozac-like drug. It's an SSRI, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. And we recently had

30:26.080 --> 30:33.040
 a preprint. This is the effect of early treatment with flu voxamine on risk of emergency care

30:33.040 --> 30:39.680
 and hospitalization among patients with COVID-19, the together randomized platform clinical trial.

30:39.680 --> 30:46.240
 So we've been waiting for this for a while. This was a placebo or controlled randomized adaptive

30:46.240 --> 30:52.320
 platform trial conducted among symptomatic Brazilian adults, confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2.

30:53.520 --> 30:59.040
 These were patients with a known risk factor for progression to severe disease. The patients

30:59.040 --> 31:05.520
 were randomly assigned to either flu voxamine, 100 milligrams twice daily for 10 days, or placebo.

31:05.520 --> 31:11.600
 And the primary endpoint was a composite outcome of an emergency room visit for greater than six

31:11.600 --> 31:18.160
 hours of observation, or ending up in the hospital in the 28 days post-randomization,

31:18.160 --> 31:26.640
 which was an intent to treat analysis. Now, a total of 3,238 patients were allocated.

31:27.360 --> 31:34.240
 We ended up with 739 getting flu voxamine. We ended up with 733 in the placebo group. There

31:34.240 --> 31:40.080
 actually were other treatments, and there was an N of 1766 for those. What did they find?

31:40.800 --> 31:45.840
 The proportion of patients with this composite endpoint of observation in the ER for greater

31:45.840 --> 31:54.720
 than six hours or admission to the hospital was lower relative risk 0.71. So about a 29% reduction.

31:54.720 --> 32:01.120
 Most of these outcomes, 88% of them, were hospitalizations. They also looked at viral

32:01.120 --> 32:06.880
 clearance. They didn't see a difference there. They looked at other outcomes, mortality,

32:06.880 --> 32:11.520
 time to death, number of days, ventilated, et cetera. They didn't find anything there. So it

32:11.520 --> 32:17.120
 really was just this really, mainly an outcome on the impact of hospitalizations. This is an

32:17.120 --> 32:21.920
 interesting study, but this is what active six and other trials are going to address. I really

32:21.920 --> 32:26.080
 don't want people to rush out. This is not two years ago where everyone starts rushing out and

32:26.080 --> 32:31.840
 putting someone on a drug just because there's one study. This is helpful. This supports

32:31.840 --> 32:38.480
 including this in active six. So if you find this exciting, Google, go to clinicaltrials.org,

32:38.480 --> 32:44.320
 get your patients connected for active six. Daniel, so of all the things they looked at,

32:45.920 --> 32:52.640
 mortality, time to death, days hospitalized, days ventilated. No change except the time you

32:52.640 --> 32:59.520
 spend in the emergency room. What does that mean? You know, let's look at Remdesivir, right?

32:59.520 --> 33:07.280
 So Remdesivir, $3,000 a course. And all we have is maybe less people spend less time in the hospital,

33:07.280 --> 33:12.400
 right? You know, here is a medication. We're not seeing a mortality benefit. There's no crime

33:12.400 --> 33:16.720
 against humanity here. We don't have to rush to get this to market. Maybe less people end up in

33:16.720 --> 33:20.480
 the hospital. It is a psychiatric drug. So maybe they feel a little bit better. I don't feel like

33:20.480 --> 33:24.800
 they need to go to the hospital. It made me think of digoxin, which apparently if you give people

33:24.800 --> 33:31.280
 digoxin, they're less likely to go to the hospital. But yeah. Okay. So yeah. Okay.

33:32.480 --> 33:37.280
 All right. So we're going to jump to tail. The tail phase, long COVID, post COVID.

33:38.320 --> 33:44.800
 We had the article one year outcomes in hospital survivors with COVID-19, a longitudinal cohort

33:44.800 --> 33:51.680
 study. This was published in the Lancet. This was an ambideirectional study, meaning it's both

33:51.680 --> 33:59.120
 retrospective and prospective phases of the study. COVID-19 survivors who are discharged from this

33:59.120 --> 34:06.720
 particular hospital in Wuhan, China, between January 7th and May 29th of 2020. And we have

34:06.720 --> 34:13.360
 six month and 12 month follow-up visit questionnaires looking at symptoms, health-related quality of

34:13.360 --> 34:18.720
 life questions. These individuals also had a physical examination, a six minute walking test,

34:18.720 --> 34:24.640
 and laboratory tests as well. What they reported that the proportion of patients with at least

34:24.640 --> 34:33.440
 one sequelae symptom was 68% at six months and 49% at 12 months fatigue muscle weakness were the

34:33.440 --> 34:41.520
 most common symptoms. You know, maybe this is why they said in kids that it's better than this.

34:41.520 --> 34:47.120
 So by comparison, maybe that's what they were after. But I have to say, long COVID is continuing

34:47.120 --> 34:52.880
 to be a tragedy. We do a lot of, let's say, consulting with companies who are trying to figure

34:52.880 --> 35:00.480
 out employees that developed acute COVID who now cannot end up back at their pre-COVID

35:00.480 --> 35:06.480
 employment. It's about 10 or 12% at these large companies that use UAC as their insurance.

35:06.480 --> 35:11.760
 This, this is tough, right? You know, even if you could cut that in half, you'd still be five or

35:11.760 --> 35:17.040
 six percent severely affected enough that they can't return to work. One of the things they did

35:17.040 --> 35:21.200
 comment, and I think this is consistent what we've seen before, what's predictive of people who end

35:21.200 --> 35:28.160
 up with long COVID, which I suggest is a subset of PASC, higher risk for women. Higher risk for

35:28.160 --> 35:33.040
 people who receive steroids or had more severe disease, those two may be a little bit intertwined,

35:33.040 --> 35:39.040
 right? If you have more severe disease, you may meet criteria for steroids. Now we have,

35:40.000 --> 35:43.360
 I'm going to say this is positive news, but then you can tell me if it's positive news,

35:43.360 --> 35:48.480
 because this gets back to this issue of do we need to infect, do we need to prevent more than

35:48.480 --> 35:54.160
 hospitalizations and deaths? Do we care about infection? And so this was the paper, risk factors

35:54.160 --> 36:01.680
 and disease profile of post vaccination, SARS-CoV-2 infection in UK users of the COVID-19

36:01.680 --> 36:09.200
 symptom study app, a prospective community-based nested case control study. So actually just COVID,

36:09.200 --> 36:14.160
 not COVID-19, I think we're starting to drop COVID-19, it's sort of the only COVID out there.

36:15.440 --> 36:21.840
 This was a prospective community-based nested case control study, right? So they've got a big

36:21.840 --> 36:28.880
 cohort and they're looking within that. This was self-reported data from this UK-based

36:28.880 --> 36:35.760
 database cohort. Everyone was an adult, so greater than or equal to 18 years of age. This is a

36:35.760 --> 36:41.680
 mobile phone app that they're using, so really kind of clever here. And then they're going to look

36:41.680 --> 36:47.440
 at cases that received a first or a second dose. They're going to look at people that tested

36:47.440 --> 36:54.480
 positive. So what were sort of the takeaway from this? So in addition to all the other benefits of

36:54.480 --> 36:59.360
 vaccination, which just were sort of reinforced in this study, they found that the odds of having

36:59.360 --> 37:07.360
 symptoms for 28 days or more, so long COVID, after post vaccination infection was approximately

37:07.360 --> 37:13.600
 halved by having two vaccine doses. So this result suggests that the risk of long COVID

37:13.600 --> 37:19.200
 is reduced to individuals who have received double vaccination. This is sort of a little bit

37:19.200 --> 37:24.160
 of an issue and I think it's back to that original. I was saying that from our large cohorts,

37:24.160 --> 37:30.640
 maybe 10 or 12% of individuals have such severe long COVID, they can't return to work. It's going

37:30.640 --> 37:36.880
 to be really interesting to tease out how severe is this long COVID because half of 10 or 12%, half

37:36.880 --> 37:42.480
 of those large numbers, if we still have five or 6% of people who get COVID with long COVID,

37:43.200 --> 37:47.280
 providing them from going to work, if you take some of those other numbers that we talked about,

37:47.280 --> 37:52.960
 68% having a symptom at six months, you drop that to 34. These are still big numbers. So

37:52.960 --> 37:59.680
 this does raise the question of considering long COVID as disease. So maybe that gets at my,

37:59.680 --> 38:02.960
 like, do we want to protect, want to protect them against infection completely?

38:04.320 --> 38:08.080
 I think that what we're really, what I'm really trying to say here is I think long COVID falls

38:08.080 --> 38:12.880
 under the disease and one of the things we want to permit. The problem, Daniel, is that this is

38:12.880 --> 38:20.320
 different from every other vaccine because there's no long measles, there's no long polio, right?

38:20.320 --> 38:28.160
 And so if this is true, and I think we need to know more about what variants we're circulating

38:28.160 --> 38:34.080
 and so forth, that could be an issue. I agree. Yeah, no, excellent point. Excellent point.

38:34.960 --> 38:41.040
 All right. So I always like to touch on the world situation, right? No one is safe until

38:41.040 --> 38:45.680
 everyone is safe. And I think on an upcoming episode, I'm going to probably spend a little time

38:45.680 --> 38:51.440
 talking about the Global Vaccine Initiative, discussing GAVI and COVAX, also potentially

38:51.440 --> 38:56.000
 give our listeners a little bit of insight into how they might contribute and be part of that effort.

38:56.640 --> 39:01.600
 But along those lines, reminders to all our listeners throughout the months of August,

39:01.600 --> 39:06.240
 September, October, donations made to PWB are going to support floating doctors.

39:06.240 --> 39:10.960
 And let me share an email I just recently got from Jolie Lebrot of floating doctors,

39:10.960 --> 39:16.960
 just letting folks know what's going on down there. The team in Panama is fairing well and is

39:16.960 --> 39:22.480
 accepting volunteers to begin seeing more patients for primary care. Thankfully, cases in Panama,

39:22.480 --> 39:28.240
 including BOCUS are on the decline, though is in the U.S. misinformation spreads as quickly

39:28.240 --> 39:33.520
 as the virus itself. Right now BOCUS is getting doses in waves. These are the vaccine doses.

39:34.320 --> 39:38.640
 Through the fifth, they will be offering the vaccine in BOCUS Town and on three neighboring

39:38.640 --> 39:43.600
 islands. The more remote communities have yet to receive the vaccine, though some of the communities

39:43.600 --> 39:48.640
 on the mainland closer to cities have been able to access them. Floating doctors is currently working

39:48.640 --> 39:53.120
 hard to educate people about the vaccine and are coordinating with the local ministries of

39:53.120 --> 40:00.240
 health to assist in distribution when they become available. So go to parasites.boarders.com,

40:00.240 --> 40:02.160
 donate so we can help support the separate.

40:02.160 --> 40:09.200
 Yeah, let me go back very briefly to the long COVID. Is it possible that since we don't really

40:09.200 --> 40:16.640
 know how long long COVID is, maybe people who are vaccinated, even though 50% may still get it,

40:16.640 --> 40:22.960
 maybe it's shorter than non-vaccinated long COVID? Yeah, there's a couple things that this study,

40:22.960 --> 40:27.280
 well, there's several things that this study doesn't tell us. And I think it's great that

40:27.280 --> 40:32.640
 we're bouncing back to this. You know, this is a, you know, people using a phone app, right? So

40:32.640 --> 40:36.400
 there's going to be a little bit of selection bias. If you're done with COVID and moving on with

40:36.400 --> 40:41.040
 your life, this may there may be a reporting bias, you're more likely to jump on so that the number

40:41.040 --> 40:49.040
 may be different. The severity may be different. And also, this is this is really a short follow

40:49.040 --> 40:54.240
 up, right? This is 28 days. You're barely there in my mind. I always say that 28 days is sort of

40:54.240 --> 41:00.240
 the early people who are vaccinated. What if we go to two months, three months? I'm still optimistic.

41:00.240 --> 41:05.600
 I mean, the biology, the science suggests to me that we should see protection against this type

41:05.600 --> 41:13.360
 of disease as well. Yeah, okay. Yeah, I agree. All right, time for some questions for Daniel.

41:13.360 --> 41:19.760
 You can send yours to Daniel at microbe.tv. Jeff from California, my wife and I are both

41:19.760 --> 41:25.600
 scientists and we are having a serious scientific disagreement by studying the literature. She has

41:25.600 --> 41:33.760
 decided that one can be infectious without the tests detecting the infection. She's not talking

41:33.760 --> 41:38.400
 about normal false negative rate, but rather, there is a couple of day period before the symptom

41:38.400 --> 41:42.640
 onset where some patients can be infectious, but not shedding enough virus to be detected by the

41:42.640 --> 41:51.040
 standard tests below the detection threshold of the test. I think that regardless of her reading

41:51.040 --> 41:56.560
 around, this is impossible. I suppose this might be slightly possible if somehow the virus is in

41:56.560 --> 42:00.960
 your lungs, but not your nose, but where the test is done. But this seems unlikely to me

42:00.960 --> 42:05.200
 and what happened in a vanishingly small number of cases. So can you help distinguish between her

42:05.200 --> 42:10.640
 reading around and my logic? Thanks. Yeah, I'm going to get in trouble here, right? You know,

42:10.640 --> 42:15.440
 your wife is always right, but some of the things she's thinking perhaps need to evolve a little

42:15.440 --> 42:20.480
 bit. Our tests are incredibly sensitive. And I think I've talked several times about this large

42:20.480 --> 42:27.040
 testing program we have for the movie industry. The test actually, particularly the PCR, turns

42:27.040 --> 42:32.960
 positive prior to a person becoming infectious. So yes, the period when the person is mostly

42:32.960 --> 42:37.600
 contagious, mostly transmitting is two days before symptom onset, three days afterwards,

42:37.600 --> 42:43.520
 but there's a little bit of a tail there to the right. Your PCR turns positive prior to you spray.

42:43.520 --> 42:48.960
 If this wasn't true, our whole screening program would have been a disaster, you know, all the

42:48.960 --> 42:53.520
 content you're enjoying on, you know, Amazon Prime and Netflix wouldn't be there, a Lionsgate,

42:53.520 --> 42:59.760
 et cetera. So no, the tests pick a person up before they become infectious. And actually,

42:59.760 --> 43:04.000
 with the PCR continues to pick you up even after you've passed through that period of time.

43:04.000 --> 43:08.720
 So the antigen tests tend to correlate more with that period of contagiousness,

43:09.440 --> 43:16.080
 high levels of the viral antigen. But I will say the one thing that maybe your wife is right about,

43:16.080 --> 43:22.000
 and maybe she was thinking is none of our tests are 100% sensitive. So you're gonna miss stuff,

43:22.000 --> 43:25.760
 but you're just missing stuff because of failure of the test, not because of a biology.

43:27.120 --> 43:31.680
 Zinta from New York writes, our daughter was born during the pandemic and due to lockdown,

43:31.680 --> 43:36.800
 had limited contact to other children and adults. As a result, she's never been sick with colds or

43:36.800 --> 43:42.560
 other illnesses. She's now 15 months, we would like to enroll her in daycare for socialization

43:42.560 --> 43:47.360
 and learning. However, the increasing rates of COVID and hospitalization and young children is

43:47.360 --> 43:53.920
 alarming as you highlight in 797. I worry that by sending my one year old to daycare, I may be

43:53.920 --> 44:00.480
 dooming her to COVID-19 with unknown consequences. To minimize risks, would you keep infants and

44:00.480 --> 44:05.840
 toddlers out of daycare as long as possible and try to wait for a vaccine, or can risks of infection

44:05.840 --> 44:10.480
 be minimized by going to daycare two or three days a week, or by dropping out if prevalence

44:10.480 --> 44:16.880
 increases above a certain threshold in the community, or is hospitalization still so rare in toddlers

44:16.880 --> 44:21.120
 and infants that we really should not worry about COVID and focus on the benefits of socialization

44:21.120 --> 44:26.880
 at this young age? Okay, so there's a lot, a lot in there to unpack, but I'm gonna focus on,

44:26.880 --> 44:32.320
 I think the main overriding thing is that we've been talking about for a while, we have presented

44:32.320 --> 44:37.760
 several studies on this, is that you can safely get children in schools, you can safely actually

44:37.760 --> 44:43.440
 get children under the age of six in these child care settings. There are certain recommended

44:43.440 --> 44:48.000
 mitigation strategies to make that safe. I think there was actually a recent study where like

44:48.000 --> 44:53.120
 children in school had one third the rate of infection as opposed to the community, right? So

44:53.120 --> 45:00.000
 if you look at some of these mitigation strategies, vaccinating the staff, that's huge, right? That's

45:00.000 --> 45:04.640
 gonna reduce their chance of getting infected, and I think we have a growing body of evidence,

45:04.640 --> 45:09.600
 their chance of spreading it to the others. Regular testing programs, good ventilation,

45:10.160 --> 45:15.440
 kids at this age, they're not wearing masks, I think that's just reasonable. But there are ways

45:15.440 --> 45:20.880
 to do this safely, and I'm gonna say there's ways to do it safely that that outweigh that sort of

45:20.880 --> 45:26.160
 would err on the side of your potentially better off having your child in this setting with all

45:26.160 --> 45:33.520
 the advantages of the social interaction, this can be done safely. Jamie writes, I'm an emergency

45:33.520 --> 45:39.040
 physician and mom of two ages one and two years old working in Albuquerque, New Mexico. You mentioned

45:39.040 --> 45:43.760
 in the last update that the overall risk of hospitalization is two percent for children.

45:43.760 --> 45:47.360
 I was wondering if we have more information about that specifically, what's the breakdown

45:47.360 --> 45:52.800
 by age group? I would imagine under one year old is most likely to require hospitalization,

45:52.800 --> 45:58.000
 but beyond that, what's the median length of stay for these children? What interventions

45:58.000 --> 46:03.680
 are being needed? And what is the rate of children requiring intubation? What comorbidities or

46:03.680 --> 46:10.000
 other factors contribute to risk of hospitalization? And lastly, what is the rate of MISC or do we

46:10.000 --> 46:16.080
 even know? Okay, so this is fantastic, right? This is the kind of questions and knowledge

46:16.080 --> 46:22.160
 that you want your physician to seek. And I talked early on in the children in COVID section that

46:22.880 --> 46:29.520
 the AAP children in COVID-19 state level data page not only does it have like an overview,

46:29.520 --> 46:35.120
 but you can go to the very bottom and you can actually download this extensive PDF with answers

46:35.120 --> 46:39.840
 to a lot of the questions that you're asking about. So yeah, as you can imagine, I've looked

46:39.840 --> 46:44.080
 through this and there really is a gradation, right? The closer you get to being an adult,

46:44.080 --> 46:48.160
 the closer your risks are to those of an adult, the younger you get, the lower those get.

46:48.720 --> 46:52.800
 And then I talked a little bit about, depending on where you look in different states, it might

46:52.800 --> 46:58.880
 be as low as 1.6 of the hospitalizations are children, other states it's 3.6, but they break

46:58.880 --> 47:05.360
 this down into all these different variables, age, state, etc. Thomas writes, my mother suffers

47:05.360 --> 47:11.120
 from a few autoimmune diseases, lupus, sojourn syndrome, anti-phospholipid syndrome. She hasn't

47:11.120 --> 47:17.120
 been vaccinated yet at a fear of thrombosis. Her doctor could say only that she on the one

47:17.120 --> 47:21.840
 hand recommends getting vaccinated, but on the other hand does not recommend it. One problem is

47:21.840 --> 47:26.080
 that depending to which doctor she goes regarding her disease in general, some recommend getting

47:26.080 --> 47:31.920
 anticoagulants, others tell her she can live without them. So she doesn't take anything against

47:31.920 --> 47:36.880
 thrombosis as exercise might be enough and is the more comfortable option. Since I doubt that her

47:36.880 --> 47:42.320
 immunity is around the corner anytime soon, my question is, do I want to get infected with or

47:42.320 --> 47:46.800
 without vaccine protection? What's the best way to go from here for my mother?

47:47.680 --> 47:52.480
 Okay. So there's a lot in there, and there was that one question about a person with lupus. Do

47:52.480 --> 47:56.960
 they benefit being on anticoagulation or not? And there are certain features I'm going to defer

47:56.960 --> 48:02.000
 to the rheumatologist who can sort of sort that out and make that. But what about COVID, right?

48:02.000 --> 48:06.160
 We're saying at this point, your choice is between getting exposed to COVID, having a natural

48:06.160 --> 48:11.200
 infection with all the risks and benefits or the vaccine. I am going to recommend, you know,

48:11.200 --> 48:16.640
 in a situation like this, I would recommend vaccination because the risks of clotting complications

48:16.640 --> 48:22.240
 with COVID are significant. So an individual like this who gets COVID, I would be quite concerned

48:22.880 --> 48:30.400
 20, 30% chance of a venous or arterial clotting complication. We probably would recommend an

48:30.400 --> 48:35.520
 mRNA vaccine in an individual like this. And the other, I want to use this opportunity,

48:35.520 --> 48:39.840
 there was a recent study, and I was going to put it in, but this is even better just to bring it up.

48:40.400 --> 48:44.240
 There are a bunch of people say, I've had lots and lots of allergies. I've had issues with other

48:44.240 --> 48:49.120
 vaccines. I want a letter from my allergist or doctor saying, I don't have to get this vaccine.

48:49.680 --> 48:55.600
 They looked at these individuals and individuals, even with a report of multiple allergies,

48:55.600 --> 49:01.040
 all kinds of other issues, 99% of these individuals tolerate these vaccines.

49:01.040 --> 49:08.240
 The few like the 1% or so tend to have mild issues. So if you've had an issue with this vaccine or

49:08.240 --> 49:13.280
 a component in this vaccine, that's one thing. But if you have autoimmune diseases, if you have

49:13.280 --> 49:18.560
 allergies, if you have the other things, we are still routinely recommending vaccination across

49:18.560 --> 49:26.320
 the board, much safer than getting COVID. All right. And because this is episode 800, one extra email,

49:26.320 --> 49:31.760
 this is a statement that I think we need to make. It's not really a question from Lena,

49:33.040 --> 49:39.360
 who says, I know I'm probably preaching to the choir since most of your listeners are like-minded,

49:39.360 --> 49:43.680
 but I wanted to send this in. She posted it on her Facebook page in hopes it would give

49:43.680 --> 49:50.960
 anti-vaxxers an idea of what life is like for those who are scared. So her child is seven years old.

49:50.960 --> 49:55.360
 He has made it to age seven, only through the help of many doctors, medicines, and the alert,

49:55.360 --> 50:00.720
 and aware adults in his life. He's medically fragile. He doesn't look it, but he is one of

50:00.720 --> 50:05.360
 millions with an invisible illness. He's been in the hospital multiple times, takes multiple

50:05.360 --> 50:10.320
 medications every day. He's at high risk. He's why we're continuing to stay home, mask up, get

50:10.320 --> 50:16.560
 vaccinated, and only allow vaccinated individuals to visit. If you think a vaccine is traumatic,

50:16.560 --> 50:22.400
 imagine watching your child struggle to breathe, gray skinned and blue-lipped. If you think wearing

50:22.400 --> 50:28.000
 a mask is too much, imagine watching doctors and nurses pump your child full of medicines

50:28.000 --> 50:33.360
 to help him breathe. If you think staying home is hard, imagine a doctor telling you that they're

50:33.360 --> 50:38.000
 going to try one more thing, but if it doesn't work, they're going to have to intubate your child

50:38.000 --> 50:43.680
 to give him a break from working so hard to breathe. If you think a cold is no big deal,

50:43.680 --> 50:49.440
 imagine lying behind your child in a hospital bed, watching the number on the oxygen monitor,

50:49.440 --> 50:55.040
 praying it stays above 90 so it doesn't beep and summon the nurse again so you can get five

50:55.040 --> 51:02.000
 minutes of sleep. Imagine that, then imagine it again and again. That's only a fraction of

51:02.000 --> 51:07.840
 what we've endured as a family. Those things are traumatic. They're too much. They're hard.

51:07.840 --> 51:13.440
 They're a big deal. Those things are why we keep him safe. He's not disposable. He's not a burden.

51:13.440 --> 51:18.720
 He's very much loved by everyone. He brings joy to our lives. He deserves to be protected,

51:18.720 --> 51:25.200
 protect him and the millions of people who suffer from invisible illnesses. Happy birthday, JJ.

51:25.200 --> 51:35.920
 Thank you for teaching us so much. Wow. It's a very powerful email. I wish that all the people,

51:35.920 --> 51:40.640
 but I was talking about wife today. The polls have gotten to the point where it's down to only

51:40.640 --> 51:46.080
 about 20% of people are saying they would refuse to get vaccinated and we think half of those people

51:46.080 --> 51:50.000
 may have already been vaccinated. They just don't want to lose membership in the tribe.

51:50.000 --> 51:56.960
 So this vaccine has an anti-vaxx population. It's really shrinking. They're very loud.

51:56.960 --> 52:01.360
 They're very vocal. But I think a lot of people realize that a lot of people are coming.

52:01.360 --> 52:05.920
 This isn't just about you. We live in a community. This is like having a protest

52:05.920 --> 52:11.840
 advocating for drunk driving or something. If you get COVID and you transmit it, you could kill

52:11.840 --> 52:17.120
 someone else and you could end up, we're seeing thousands of kids end up in the hospital each week.

 The majority of those children were infected by someone who's unvaccinated. So that's how the

52:21.920 --> 52:27.200
 unvaccinated. Don't just think about yourself. I think our listeners are on board with this.

52:27.920 --> 52:32.880
 I also think it's a good response to people say, oh, it's traumatic for kids to wear face masks

52:32.880 --> 52:37.120
 in school. As you have said, Daniel, far more traumatic to be in the hospital.

52:37.120 --> 52:45.920
 Yeah. Yeah. That's COVID-19 clinical update number 78 with Dr. Daniel Griffin. Thank you, Daniel.

52:45.920 --> 53:15.760
 Oh, thank you. And everyone, including you, Vincent, be safe.
