 This week in virology, the podcast about viruses, the kind that make you sick.

00:10.320 --> 00:20.720
 From Microbe TV, this is Twiv, this week in virology, episode 716, recorded on February 4,

00:20.720 --> 00:26.880
 2021. I'm Vincent Rackeniello, and you're listening to the podcast all about viruses

00:26.880 --> 00:33.840
 joining me today from New York, Daniel Griffin. Hello, everyone. So Daniel,

00:33.840 --> 00:39.440
 January is over. You said it was going to be the worst January. Did that turn out to be true?

00:40.880 --> 00:48.000
 It certainly did. The only good thing is it is now over, and we have passed my favorite day of the

00:48.000 --> 00:56.000
 year, Groundhog Day. So it sort of means at least we could start looking forward to a better spring,

00:56.000 --> 01:04.240
 but it's been a horrible January. I sometimes feel like we're kind of US-centric, and in the US,

01:04.240 --> 01:10.240
 I feel like we've kind of crested or we are in the process of cresting a huge wave. The case

01:10.240 --> 01:16.800
 numbers, I think, are coming down after the holidays, but the deaths, we're seeing the deaths from

01:16.800 --> 01:22.560
 all those cases still. So still a lot of deaths. There's still a lot of patients in the hospital,

01:23.200 --> 01:27.360
 but I think we have better days ahead in the US, but I'm going to make sure I hit on this.

01:27.360 --> 01:31.440
 We can't forget about the rest of the world, because no one's safe until everyone's safe.

01:32.640 --> 01:40.160
 Let me start with a quotation we have a lot to do today, how very little can be done under the

01:40.160 --> 01:49.200
 spirit of fear, and that's Florence Nightingale. A couple things I really like, well, a very

01:49.200 --> 01:58.400
 inspirational woman who really advanced nursing, but a couple of things it brings, I think,

01:58.400 --> 02:05.360
 makes me think of. One is just how critical the nurses are in taking care of patients,

02:05.360 --> 02:10.880
 and how critical I think they are in the culture of medicine. They bring a real warmth and a caring

02:11.440 --> 02:18.000
 to patient care. And just this pointing out that people work better in a cooperative,

02:18.000 --> 02:24.560
 in a supportive, in a culture of generosity and kindness. And I think in a lot of ways over the

02:24.560 --> 02:30.720
 last year that has been forgotten, there's been a lot of rigidity and rules, and this is how we're

02:30.720 --> 02:38.880
 doing it. I know hospitals are struggling financially, but you can't lose sight of we're not there

02:38.880 --> 02:45.280
 primarily to make a dollar, we're there primarily to take care of people. And the almighty dollar

02:45.280 --> 02:52.240
 has to come second to a patient's life, patient's care. So, all right, we'll start off with the

02:52.240 --> 02:57.280
 pre-exposure period with my three rules that actually started to see these echoed a bit in

02:57.280 --> 03:03.520
 the media, which is great. Never miss an opportunity to vaccinate, never miss an opportunity to test

03:04.080 --> 03:10.800
 and never waste a precious vaccine dose. So, today I'm going to be talking about mutations,

03:10.800 --> 03:19.040
 vaccines, and some anticoagulation, very exciting anticoagulation updates. So, active vaccination,

03:19.040 --> 03:25.600
 in this realm, and it really, it goes into several of the different phases or stages of COVID-19,

03:25.600 --> 03:32.880
 but I'm going to try to talk a little bit about these in a context that makes sense for

03:32.880 --> 03:37.600
 clinicians. Like, what are we as clinicians? How do we understand this language and what is going

03:37.600 --> 03:43.360
 on here? So, I'm going to hit up some important highlights, but just a little background, right?

03:43.360 --> 03:51.360
 We are on Twiv. This is science heavy, and that is good. This is an RNA virus. So, there's going

03:51.360 --> 03:58.560
 to be changes to the genetic code being randomly introduced when this virus replicates. An infected

03:58.560 --> 04:06.480
 person has a large number of replicating virions. So, not every single virus in a person is exactly

04:06.480 --> 04:12.880
 the same. Sort of a quasi-species people talk about sometimes. I know in the world of HIV.

04:14.080 --> 04:20.160
 Now, I am going to oversimplify a little, but a change in the genetic code can be silent,

04:20.160 --> 04:27.920
 or they can actually result in a change in amino acids for which the protein is being coded.

04:28.560 --> 04:35.520
 I say this is simplified because RNA itself can have some functionality. So, as clinicians,

04:35.520 --> 04:41.760
 why do we care about mutations? We all enjoy science fiction, but why do we actually care

04:41.760 --> 04:48.240
 in our day-to-day? One is the specter that changed the genetic code of the virus. A mutation can

04:48.240 --> 04:54.800
 make the virus more transmissible. We want to give that just a little bit of context. It's not as

04:54.800 --> 04:59.440
 though the change in the genetic code makes the virus fly through the air more quickly. Nothing

04:59.440 --> 05:06.720
 like that. But maybe I think as Anthony Fauci said in his first, we'll call it, the Post-Trump

05:06.720 --> 05:14.160
 Giddy news conference, it could affect the ability of the virus to bind tightly to its target receptor

05:14.160 --> 05:21.920
 to the ACE2 receptor. So, it might be more transmissible in that it's easier for a smaller exposure

05:21.920 --> 05:28.480
 to result in an infection. It could potentially change the virulence. It could either make the

05:28.480 --> 05:36.400
 virus more or less virulent. And then as clinicians, a big one for us is, are these changes going to

05:36.400 --> 05:42.240
 impact our therapeutics or the immune response? So, is it going to affect, for instance, our drugs,

05:42.240 --> 05:50.320
 our monoclonal therapies, or our vaccines? So, just to give people a little bit of language here,

05:50.320 --> 05:57.440
 so the changes we care about are mutations or deletions. These are inevitable, right?

05:57.440 --> 06:04.000
 Variants are thus expected, but it's really the biologically significant changes that we care

06:04.000 --> 06:08.880
 about. So, for each variant of concern, we can ask this question about the genetic changes,

06:08.880 --> 06:14.800
 the mutations, the deletions, potentially even some additions, but we won't really go into that

06:14.800 --> 06:19.200
 today. But most of the changes, I'm going to, actually all the changes I'm going to talk about

06:19.200 --> 06:26.240
 today, are going to affect the biology of the spike protein, right? So, just a little bit

06:26.240 --> 06:30.720
 about the spike protein. I always try to use visuals to get people to think about this,

06:30.720 --> 06:38.480
 and sometimes my visuals are more of the cartoony, but the spike protein is a protein. It's made up

06:38.480 --> 06:44.960
 of amino acids, right? Amino acids come together and make a protein. This protein is 1,273 amino acids

06:44.960 --> 06:54.160
 long. In general, we'll say the Wuhan reference strain, but that spike protein is for clinicians

06:54.160 --> 07:00.000
 to really kind of put this in your mind in a terminology you can remember on the fly.

07:00.000 --> 07:04.080
 There's really two important parts of that spike protein that we're going to talk about.

07:04.080 --> 07:10.560
 The N-terminal domain, the NTD, it's not neglected tropical disease, and the receptor binding domain,

07:10.560 --> 07:15.920
 the RBD. I'm going to ignore some of the others just for simplicity because there's a lot of

07:15.920 --> 07:20.880
 complexity here. There's areas where this could be broken down, cleaved proteases, the rest,

07:20.880 --> 07:29.200
 but just for today, the NTD, the N-terminal domain, and the RBD. I want people to think

07:29.200 --> 07:33.520
 about this as the analogy of a hand, and we're going to get back into that, the hand and the arm.

07:34.560 --> 07:38.880
 But just some of the terminology, what are these crazy numbers and letters, right? I know we've

07:38.880 --> 07:44.240
 been told don't call it the UK strain. Don't call it the South African strain, so people have now

07:44.240 --> 07:50.480
 thrown in the numbers and said originally isolated in the UK. So I'm going to acknowledge that.

07:51.040 --> 07:57.120
 So as I mentioned, the spike protein is 1,273 amino acids long. Don't tune out. It's going to be

07:57.120 --> 08:01.360
 OK. You're going to make it through. This is critical stuff to know. And what are those numbers?

08:01.360 --> 08:06.240
 The numbers start with the N-terminal domain. That's where one is. And at the far right,

08:06.240 --> 08:12.240
 think of this in your head. That's going to be 1273. The deletions are going to be the same thing.

08:12.240 --> 08:17.680
 So when we hear a number, we're talking about a particular amino acid that has changed.

08:17.680 --> 08:21.520
 So when you talk about, I'm going to give some concrete examples. When you talk about an N

08:21.520 --> 08:31.040
 501Y, that means we're talking about a change, an amino acid 501, and the N has changed to a Y.

08:31.040 --> 08:37.760
 Well, what is an N? I mean, an N is a code. Help us, you know, use a one letter code for

08:37.760 --> 08:45.440
 our amino acid. So an N is an S-bar gene. A T is a tyrosine. And so the N goes to the Y.

08:45.440 --> 08:49.840
 I have to look those up. I'll be honest. But just let people kind of get a sense here. When you

08:49.840 --> 08:58.720
 hear an N 501Y, when you hear an E or 84K, that's 484. The E has changed to a K. So we'll talk a

08:58.720 --> 09:04.160
 little bit about this. If you hear deletion, deletion 69 test 70, that's going to mean those

09:04.160 --> 09:10.240
 amino acid 6970 were deleted, right? So a little trick here to help people just think,

09:10.240 --> 09:16.240
 because this is going to become a number soup going forward, right? Every one of those 1273

09:16.240 --> 09:22.720
 amino acids can change or be deleted. The N terminal domain that goes from about 14 to 306.

09:23.280 --> 09:28.640
 And the RBD, you could use the palm of my hand analogy, the RBD, the receptor body domain that

09:28.640 --> 09:36.800
 grabs onto spike is 330 to 528. So 331 to 528 to be exact. So anything that affects the palm of

09:36.800 --> 09:41.360
 the hand is going to affect the ability of the spike to grab its receptor. And I'm going to say

09:41.360 --> 09:45.520
 the NTD, think of that as affecting the back of the hand. It's not right in the binding pocket,

09:45.520 --> 09:51.200
 but it may affect the modality of the binding pocket. So hopefully this allows people to

09:51.200 --> 09:56.480
 get a little sense. So what are these numbers? What are these letters soup? So let's just talk a

09:56.480 --> 10:01.840
 little bit about each of the described strains. So today I'm going to talk briefly to where we're

10:01.840 --> 10:09.600
 going to go to other stuff about the B117 strain, originally described in the UK. The B135 strain

10:09.600 --> 10:16.640
 described originally in South Africa. The Cal-20C that we're seeing out in California and the B128

10:16.640 --> 10:23.040
 detected in Brazil, then Japan. Variants, Daniel, variants. And I call them variants or strains.

10:23.040 --> 10:25.440
 Variants. That's the variants of concern, remember?

10:26.320 --> 10:31.520
 So let's talk about that. This is great because clinicians, what variant versus strain? What is

10:31.520 --> 10:36.320
 the difference? And the difference, and this is why this is this weekend virology, and we have

10:36.320 --> 10:45.360
 Vincent chaperoning. A strain is when we have convincing biological activity change. A variant

10:45.360 --> 10:50.240
 is when we have a change in the genetic sequence, right? So calling something a strain requires a

10:50.240 --> 10:57.520
 higher bar. So the B117, I will use variant of concern here, originally described in the UK.

10:58.560 --> 11:04.400
 It has that D614G that we've been hearing about for a while. It's got a couple deletions,

11:04.400 --> 11:14.320
 and it has the N501Y, which is suggested to maybe allow that spike to bind better, right?

11:15.680 --> 11:23.680
 The B135 variant of concern, originally described in South Africa. This has that D614G also,

11:23.680 --> 11:31.200
 but it's also got the E484K. Now, why do we care about that as clinicians?

11:31.200 --> 11:36.880
 We care because there is some experimental evidence suggesting that that may affect our

11:36.880 --> 11:42.240
 monoclonal antibodies, a couple of them, so the BAM-lineva-mab and the IM-deva-mab.

11:43.360 --> 11:50.880
 There's also a K417N in this variant of concern that we are concerned may decrease the monoclonal

11:51.840 --> 11:59.360
 Casariva-mab efficacy, and this also has that N501Y, which we think may allow it to bind a

11:59.360 --> 12:09.600
 little bit better. Cal20C, that's got this L452R, which we also think decreases the efficacy of our

12:09.600 --> 12:15.360
 BAM-BAM, and also may be associated with decreased plasma effects. So maybe there's some

12:16.880 --> 12:21.360
 impact upon someone who's been previously infected, and I'm just going to mention the

12:21.360 --> 12:25.120
 Brazil one last, and then just kind of try to put this all together for people in a way that

12:25.120 --> 12:34.720
 they can think about it. So the B128 detected in Brazil, then Japan, that has the E484,

12:34.720 --> 12:41.120
 which we talked about, it has the N501Y. Now, just to put this in people's mind, you're going to

12:41.120 --> 12:45.120
 hear all these numbers. So one of the things you could do is when you hear the numbers say,

12:45.120 --> 12:50.160
 okay, is that somewhere in that 331 to 520? Is that affecting the palm of the hand? Might that

12:50.160 --> 12:56.640
 affect the ability of the spike protein to bind to the receptor? And if it does, this is a sweet

12:56.640 --> 13:02.720
 spot we think for neutralizing antibodies, so it may potentially impact some of our monoclonals.

13:03.600 --> 13:09.920
 But I do want to say this guy is not falling. As people may know, I mentioned several times,

13:09.920 --> 13:16.000
 I'm involved with Eli Lilly and helping get their monoclonal antibodies to folks and trials,

13:16.000 --> 13:21.440
 also with Regeneron as well. I guess the caveat with that, they don't give me any money, but

13:22.640 --> 13:28.400
 happier with that. Maybe it would be a conflict of interest if they did. But we follow these

13:28.400 --> 13:33.600
 because we are concerned, but the other side is they have a lot of monoclonal antibodies in the

13:33.600 --> 13:39.520
 pipeline. So ones that can cover these. So if you're in an area where you're concerned about

13:39.520 --> 13:46.320
 bamelinibimab efficacy, Eli Lilly has data as we talked about on a cocktail. There's also the

13:46.320 --> 13:51.760
 Regeneron cocktail. If you're concerned about the Regeneron cocktail the other way, and then there

13:51.760 --> 14:01.360
 are other monoclonal antibodies in the pipeline, so to speak. So I envision some point, Vincent

14:01.360 --> 14:06.240
 in the future, this will be on my board exam where they'll have these up there posted, and I'll

14:06.240 --> 14:12.960
 have to remember which one just like I have to with the HIV mutations and which drugs I can and

14:12.960 --> 14:22.640
 can't use. So I'm working on some kind of memory tricks, the Nervous Nelly 501Y. That was the one

14:22.640 --> 14:29.680
 in the UK. The EEC 484K, am I really worried about that affecting my monoclonal bamelinibimab

14:29.680 --> 14:37.680
 and imdabimab? That lousy 452, does that affect my bamelinibimab? The kite 417N, so that's the

14:37.680 --> 14:45.120
 k417N slash t, is that can affect Cassie? So I think as time goes by, we'll get a better sense of

14:45.120 --> 14:50.240
 where all these come out. But there was a really nice paper out of the David Holab,

14:50.240 --> 14:58.240
 increased resistance of SARS-CoV-2 variants, B1351 and B117 to antibody neutralization.

14:58.240 --> 15:06.080
 And a lot of things described here, you have to use more codvalescent plasma, about 11 or 33

15:06.080 --> 15:13.600
 fold increase for neutralization with codvalescent plasma, about a 6.5 to 8.6 fold increase in

15:13.600 --> 15:20.160
 vaccine sera. But from a clinical standpoint, I mentioned I don't think the sky is falling.

15:20.160 --> 15:28.960
 On a positive note, we have various monoclonals that are already FDA-UA, so emergency use

15:28.960 --> 15:34.320
 authorized out there that we can use. We have others in the pipeline waiting to go

15:34.960 --> 15:41.120
 hopefully quickly through the FDA if needed. And this is something I think that we can stay

15:41.120 --> 15:47.600
 ahead of. So I'm not concerned that the sky is falling. So if that decreases our number of

15:47.600 --> 15:52.320
 Twiv listeners, because I'm not saying the sky is falling and saying stay tuned for exciting news,

15:53.040 --> 15:57.760
 I just want to be honest and reassuring. As a clinician, I think that we have the tools and

15:57.760 --> 16:02.240
 the technology to stay ahead of these things. Do you have any comments, Vincent? Do you think

16:02.240 --> 16:08.000
 the sky is falling or does it seem reasonable? No, I don't. And we've talked about this a lot

16:08.400 --> 16:15.920
 on Twiv and I don't want to usurp you. Please usurp. I think that the benefit of this is having

16:15.920 --> 16:25.200
 you as well. So jump in. So originally, the B117 variant, which originated in the UK,

16:25.200 --> 16:32.240
 originally said, oh, it's 50% more transmissible. But you know what? Since then, it's gone to many

16:32.240 --> 16:40.560
 other places and it's not doing 50% more transmissible. So it's a lot more subtle. It's a lot more nuanced

16:40.560 --> 16:46.880
 than just transmission. And I like to think of it as these changes affecting fitness.

16:47.520 --> 16:53.360
 Fitness is the ability of a virus to get to a new host. And it doesn't just

16:53.360 --> 17:00.080
 involve going through the air. It involves the amount of virus shed by someone, the ability of

17:00.080 --> 17:06.640
 the virus to take hold in the host, maybe to evade immune responses, maybe to reproduce better.

17:06.640 --> 17:11.920
 So I think sometimes these changes give the virus a little edge and it takes off, but it's not

17:11.920 --> 17:18.720
 really transmitting better. It's just spreading and displacing another virus in the population.

17:18.720 --> 17:25.840
 So that whole idea doesn't bother me. I think a more realistic concern is the change are the

17:25.840 --> 17:32.800
 changes that can abrogate monoclonal effectiveness and vaccine effectiveness, as you've talked about.

17:32.800 --> 17:39.520
 Because if you do your masking and distancing and all that, it doesn't matter, except for the

17:39.520 --> 17:43.280
 antibody resolving an infection. So that's my take on this.

17:43.280 --> 17:49.600
 And I think I get questions and I don't know if this will be guitar to throw people out. Oh, my

17:49.600 --> 17:56.240
 gosh, with these new variants, do they hear they go right through the masks? No, I think a lot of

17:56.240 --> 18:02.000
 people's perception is when they say, oh, increased transmissibility or increased transmission,

18:02.000 --> 18:06.640
 they view it as almost like a bullet. And then someone cough their sneezes and these have somehow

18:06.640 --> 18:13.200
 changed their shape and can penetrate the fibers of your mask. And you now have to use keglar masks.

18:13.200 --> 18:17.520
 I mean, I think, you know, time will tell, right? I mean, you and I are being recorded.

18:17.520 --> 18:23.040
 So in March, right, people will go back to these episodes and sort of get a better sense.

18:24.000 --> 18:30.320
 Well, you know, the 117 variant is in many other countries. And in Scotland,

18:30.320 --> 18:33.520
 it hasn't taken off in California. It's been there since November.

18:33.520 --> 18:39.120
 It has not displaced the existing variants. So something else is going on.

18:39.120 --> 18:43.680
 It's not just about going through those droplets. That's what I want people to understand.

18:44.640 --> 18:49.760
 Yeah, it's complicated. But I think the great thing is we have the science and the scientists

18:49.760 --> 18:54.480
 who are on top of this. And so we're going to get out of this. We are not going to have

18:54.480 --> 19:01.760
 another January like we just had, but Nick five. So in the Lancet, we got safety and efficacy of an

19:02.800 --> 19:10.560
 R add 26 and an R add five vector based heterologous prime boost COVID-19 vaccine.

19:10.560 --> 19:14.880
 An interim analysis of randomized controlled phase three trial in Russia.

19:15.680 --> 19:21.200
 So these were the results that we were waiting for randomized double blind placebo controlled

19:21.200 --> 19:26.560
 phase three trial in 25 hospitals and polyclinics in Moscow, Russia.

19:27.920 --> 19:36.800
 And so this vaccine group and of one of 16,501 placebo group was smaller 5,476.

19:36.800 --> 19:42.240
 And then the numbers don't quite add up because they say 19,866 received two doses

19:42.240 --> 19:47.200
 of vaccine or placebo. So there was a little bit of a you lose a few folks there between

19:47.200 --> 19:54.240
 the whole trial and everyone getting that boost. But from 21 days, and this was interesting,

19:54.800 --> 20:00.160
 from 21 days after the first dose. So that basically started counting the day people came in for

20:00.160 --> 20:10.160
 their second dose or booster. They saw that 0.1% of the vaccinated got COVID-19. 1.3% in the placebo

20:10.160 --> 20:15.520
 group, right? These are small numbers, but that gives us an efficacy about 91.6. And they've got

20:15.520 --> 20:20.880
 another one of these. These will be the curves that I've heard are now on T-shirts, immunity works.

20:21.520 --> 20:26.400
 We show the placebo group in red and just the number of confirmed COVID-19 just keeps going,

20:26.400 --> 20:31.680
 keeps going where the vaccine it goes up. And then once they've reached a level of protection,

20:31.680 --> 20:37.680
 it sort of levels out and stays pretty flat for a while. With the data here, they have actually

20:37.680 --> 20:42.480
 mentioned that they're going to do a single dose trial, which will be interesting as well.

20:42.480 --> 20:49.280
 And it's been some discussion on the main this weekend virology about some of the other data.

20:50.000 --> 20:57.520
 So more exciting news on vaccines. But let me hit a bunch of Q&A questions and answers on vaccines.

20:58.080 --> 21:01.600
 This is actually, I spend a lot of my time talking to a new Julie, my partner today,

21:01.600 --> 21:05.520
 and she's saying, what are we going to do when COVID is over? Because we spend so much of our time

21:05.520 --> 21:10.160
 addressing COVID-related questions and vaccine questions. So if the vaccine still allow

21:10.160 --> 21:17.760
 for milder symptomatic COVID mainly prevents severe COVID, what about getting a mild case

21:17.760 --> 21:24.160
 and the risk of developing long COVID? So that's an interesting question. Just to be honest,

21:24.160 --> 21:30.160
 we do not know. But this is a very interesting question. If a person has been vaccinated,

21:30.160 --> 21:36.000
 they go ahead and get a mild case of COVID. We are hoping they're less likely to develop the

21:36.000 --> 21:41.200
 long COVID, but we still don't know. And actually, this is a pretty important question, I would say.

21:42.160 --> 21:47.360
 As I get into some of the other questions, I will say I'm optimistic about this.

21:47.360 --> 21:52.880
 It looks like when people do get infected, the limited data we have that they end up with milder

21:52.880 --> 21:56.880
 symptoms, they end up with a shorter course, they end up with a shorter period of time that

21:56.880 --> 22:03.440
 they're actually shedding the virus. Or I should say that their RNA PCR positive, they also end up

22:03.440 --> 22:09.760
 at much lower, usually about two logs lower. So I'm optimistic, but yeah, I think that this is a

22:09.760 --> 22:15.600
 question that we'll keep our eye on. It sort of goes right into this next one. Any more information

22:15.600 --> 22:22.560
 on vaccinated people being less able to transmit the virus, right? This gets back to sort of Dixon's

22:22.560 --> 22:27.040
 idea that he doesn't want a healthcare worker coming and taking care of him, who's not vaccinated

22:27.040 --> 22:31.920
 because now they're more likely to give him the virus. So I always like to use scenarios,

22:31.920 --> 22:37.360
 and I get a lot of questions here about scenarios. So we have some adults, right? Over the age of 75,

22:37.360 --> 22:42.720
 they're about to get their second dose. And they're already starting to ask, well, now that I have

22:42.720 --> 22:49.120
 my second dose, what can I do? Can I go visit my friends in Florida? They've also been vaccinated.

22:49.680 --> 22:56.400
 Can I fly to go visit my adult children? What about all the other activities? So

22:56.400 --> 23:02.800
 just want to bring up some more data we have here. So analysis of PCR positive swabs in the UK

23:02.800 --> 23:09.840
 population, right? Suggesting that the vaccine may reduce transmission, but we'll get a little bit

23:09.840 --> 23:15.840
 farther into that because I want to hit on some really sort of specific scenarios. Anything new

23:15.840 --> 23:22.000
 about people who previously had COVID getting vaccinated, right? And Peter Hotez weighed in on

23:22.000 --> 23:29.600
 this, but there's some research. We've got some papers out. Robust spike antibody one responses

23:29.600 --> 23:37.040
 and increased reactogenicity in seropositive individuals after a single dose of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA

23:37.040 --> 23:41.760
 vaccine. This was out of Mount Sinai. And they actually found, and this is something I think

23:41.760 --> 23:46.720
 we're starting to see, and now it's nice to have it quantified, they found that getting that first

23:46.720 --> 23:53.360
 vaccine dose in someone who had COVID before was very similar to that second dose in folks who

23:53.360 --> 24:00.880
 did not have COVID before. So similar reactogenicity profile, but also what looks like a similar

24:00.880 --> 24:06.480
 boost in the antibody levels. What we don't know, and we're not going to know quite yet, right,

24:06.480 --> 24:12.560
 is what's the durability? What are the kinetics of those antibody responses? The other paper,

24:12.560 --> 24:18.240
 single dose vaccination in healthcare workers previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. This is out

24:18.240 --> 24:23.280
 of University of Maryland. And they really, really found about the same thing. It looked like

24:24.000 --> 24:31.040
 that one dose of the mRNA vaccine was giving these elevated antibody titers, similar to sort of the

24:31.040 --> 24:36.720
 boost we would expect from a second. So we're not encouraging people at this point to only get

24:36.720 --> 24:42.080
 one shot. We may actually end up at some point having people get even a third shot. Who knows?

24:42.880 --> 24:49.280
 But this is interesting stuff and is helpful. We're learning more. And I think it does feed to

24:49.280 --> 24:55.120
 boy, if you've had COVID before that first shot, maybe a bit of a doozy, maybe what most people

24:55.120 --> 24:59.440
 are getting the second time. I don't know why I still get this question, but is it a good idea to

24:59.440 --> 25:04.800
 keep millions of vaccine doses in the freezers to make sure that second dose is given right on

25:04.800 --> 25:10.560
 schedule? Well, unfortunately, I think everyone is aware that millions of doses of vaccines are

25:10.560 --> 25:16.000
 sitting in freezers and not getting into people's arms here in the US. And despite requests by the

25:16.000 --> 25:22.640
 White House, by Andy Slavitt, to those vaccines in arms, many large hospital systems have freezers

25:22.640 --> 25:27.280
 full of doses. Oddly enough, some rules only allow for vaccines to go to sites that have the ability

25:27.280 --> 25:33.760
 to have those freezers. In my world, you wouldn't be allowed to have vaccines if you had a freezer

25:33.760 --> 25:39.920
 that could hang on to them for more than those 30 days. Now, the CDC has updated their guidance on

25:39.920 --> 25:47.360
 COVID mRNA vaccine interim dosing to include a grace period. So you can get it four days earlier

25:47.360 --> 25:54.720
 than the three or four weeks. And then they serve statement, then out to six weeks, if it is not

25:54.720 --> 25:59.440
 feasible to adhere to the recommended interval. So they, they'll give the qualified statement

25:59.440 --> 26:04.480
 just to quote right off. CDC is not advocating for people to delay getting their second dose.

26:05.200 --> 26:11.600
 But the data from clinical trial supports this range of either four days early or out to six weeks

26:11.600 --> 26:18.400
 if you need to. So my answer really is in line with the Biden COVID task force that no, it is not

26:18.400 --> 26:25.600
 a good idea to remove two fifths of the available vaccine doses from potentially giving those people

26:25.600 --> 26:29.840
 freeze them away just because you want to hedge and are worried that there might be a slight

26:29.840 --> 26:34.800
 delay of a few in the order of days of getting the second vaccine doses into patients. So

26:34.800 --> 26:38.160
 I think people have probably heard how we've approached this at pro health. When we get our

26:38.160 --> 26:44.880
 vaccines, we put them 100% of those and up in arms as soon as possible. So if everyone would do that,

26:44.880 --> 26:51.200
 I think that this would go much quicker. Is the supply now flowing from Moderna and Pfizer or

26:51.200 --> 27:00.000
 is it jerky? The supply is flowing. We're getting 200,000 doses a week to New York.

27:00.880 --> 27:07.600
 Some of the states have to say like our riverside partners, you know, every every week they get a

27:07.600 --> 27:13.840
 consistent supply because there it's going directly to our to our clinics where we're giving everyone

27:13.840 --> 27:21.280
 the vaccines. In New York, there's still this hub model where every week you put in as a provider,

27:21.280 --> 27:26.400
 you know, we would like this many to this many sites. And even though there's a constant flow

27:26.400 --> 27:34.000
 to the state, that flow is still going to large hospital systems, healthcare systems with lots of

27:34.000 --> 27:39.360
 freezers. Every time one dose is given, another stuck in the freezer for, you know, three or four

27:39.360 --> 27:47.680
 weeks later. So yeah, it's flowing. Moderna actually increased by 33%. The amount of vaccine it's

27:47.680 --> 27:53.360
 sending out, Pfizer is increasing their production. So, you know, the government and the pharmaceutical

27:53.360 --> 27:58.320
 companies have made it clear there is this is flowing. You know, and if somebody gets their

27:58.320 --> 28:04.160
 dose delayed by a few days, that's not as much of an issue as, you know, millions of people

28:04.160 --> 28:09.760
 not getting any vaccine at all here. And I guess this we're tying into the if a second dose of a

28:09.760 --> 28:14.640
 two dose vaccine is delayed, will it be less protective? Right? Because people, I think there's two

28:14.640 --> 28:19.200
 two things here. One is person is watching the clock. I want to get that second dose so I can

28:19.200 --> 28:24.480
 then count the clock to when I'm, you know, at that 100% protection from severe disease. But

28:24.480 --> 28:30.400
 there's also that concern too, is if it's delayed by a period of time, will that mean that it's less

28:30.400 --> 28:36.240
 protective? So we are starting to get some data on that. And we had recent data from AstraZeneca

28:36.800 --> 28:42.720
 with actually interesting up demonstrated improved efficacy with longer intervals between doses

28:42.720 --> 28:48.320
 with higher antibodies and a broader antibody response with a boost given at 12 weeks,

28:48.320 --> 28:56.320
 rather than six weeks, vaccine efficacy rising from 54.9% with an interval of less than six weeks

28:56.320 --> 29:04.560
 to 82.4% when spent when spaced 12 or more weeks apart. So we still recommended hearing to the

29:04.560 --> 29:10.400
 studied intervals. But you know, this understanding of immunology. Now we're getting data really

29:10.400 --> 29:14.960
 goes along with what we've learned over many years with vaccine research. So certainly there's a

29:14.960 --> 29:20.560
 critical minimal interval before the boost to allow the effector cells to mature into memory cells.

29:20.560 --> 29:26.400
 But a slightly longer interval may be associated with a higher and broader boost of antibodies.

29:27.360 --> 29:32.160
 And I don't know if we know enough yet as far as T cell responses, whether or not they're

29:32.160 --> 29:37.600
 enhanced. But I think our basic understanding of immunology would suggest most of the benefit

29:37.600 --> 29:41.920
 here if you stretch that out a little is going to be antibodies, but definitely not a diminution.

29:41.920 --> 29:48.960
 Now that I have been vaccinated, can I do the following? So the science is developing here.

29:48.960 --> 29:53.840
 But let me run through a few scenarios and want to be careful not to get above the science,

29:53.840 --> 29:59.520
 but also to to be reasonable in what we say. So I'm using my parents as an example. My parents

29:59.520 --> 30:06.240
 will soon have reached two weeks past their second vaccination. Yesterday my wife helped my mother

30:06.240 --> 30:11.680
 get to her second vaccination. My dad pretty much can do it all by himself. So the two of them went.

30:12.800 --> 30:17.440
 And my mother reported a penicillin allergy. So they made her wait for a prolonged period of

30:17.440 --> 30:21.840
 time because I don't know why, but Rachel was not very crowded. I think they said in the entire

30:21.840 --> 30:26.560
 time they were there getting vaccinated for people got vaccinated. They were too. There were two others.

30:27.120 --> 30:32.880
 But my dad wants to start going back to the office. So what was my advice? My mother's. He can't go

30:32.880 --> 30:37.280
 to the office. He's going to get COVID. He's going to bring it home to me. So we had a couple

30:37.280 --> 30:42.960
 conversations. One is, as I said to my dad, dad, you have not gone to the office in a year. You

30:42.960 --> 30:47.760
 in two weeks will be protected. I do not have a problem with you going back to the office.

30:48.480 --> 30:55.520
 Will he wear a mask? Will he will he be careful? Yes. And my worried he's going to bring it home

30:55.520 --> 31:00.480
 and my mother will get COVID and die again? No. My mother has also been vaccinated. So

31:00.480 --> 31:06.400
 let's I think I can answer very clearly here. Two older individuals both over the age of 80.

31:06.400 --> 31:11.200
 Sorry about that, mom. You look younger and dad, you definitely look younger too. I have no problem

31:11.200 --> 31:17.520
 as a son, as a physician, being okay with them going back to with my dad going back to the office.

31:18.480 --> 31:24.640
 Now my mom wants us to come over the house for Sunday dinner indoors after she's been

31:24.640 --> 31:29.520
 vaccinated for two weeks. Is that all right? Now this is a tough thing. And this gets into what

31:29.520 --> 31:33.520
 does the science tell us? Are we underselling? Are we overselling the vaccine? My mother

31:34.160 --> 31:38.720
 will have reached her two weeks past the second dose. My father will reach this two weeks past

31:38.720 --> 31:44.960
 the second dose. Is it okay for my wife and I? And my oldest daughter will be off of college,

31:44.960 --> 31:50.160
 but for my other daughter and Barnaby, Eloise and Barnaby to go over for Sunday dinner. We haven't

31:50.160 --> 31:54.240
 had indoor dinner with them in a long time. Is it okay for the five of us to eat indoors?

31:54.960 --> 31:59.520
 I'm going to say I think it's okay. I mean, I worry about my mom. I worry about my dad,

31:59.520 --> 32:04.720
 but they've now been fully vaccinated. My dad's going to and from work, and that's it. He's,

32:04.720 --> 32:09.840
 you know, he and my mom are not suddenly socializing with big maskless parties. I'm sure it'll be

32:09.840 --> 32:15.440
 just the two of them watching the Super Bowl this weekend. So yeah, I think it's okay. Until they

32:15.440 --> 32:20.320
 reach that point, though, I do not go into their house without a mask. And even if I do go in with

32:20.320 --> 32:26.000
 the mask, I stay for limited periods of time. Now my in-laws, when they are fully vaccinated,

32:26.000 --> 32:29.360
 they want to start flying around the country, right? They've been, they've been up in Cape

32:29.360 --> 32:34.960
 Cods, you know, being really careful, staying by themselves. They want to start, they want to fly

32:34.960 --> 32:39.680
 down to Florida. They want to see their vaccinated friends there. They want to fly out to Utah to

32:39.680 --> 32:45.760
 see their, their daughter is that safe for them. Yes. And I actually think if they're flying down to

32:45.760 --> 32:50.800
 Florida, if they're staying at a hotel and they're going to be outdoors with friends in Florida,

32:50.800 --> 32:56.080
 I actually, I see really minimal risk. I see that being a reasonable risk taking activity.

32:56.080 --> 33:02.480
 When they go out to see their daughter in, in Utah, we are hoping that the data will pan out. I expect

33:02.480 --> 33:07.600
 the data to pan out that people who are vaccinated are less likely to transmit to others, but we're

33:07.600 --> 33:13.840
 still waiting on the science on that. So that then is going to be, you know, is it, is it a risk for

33:13.840 --> 33:19.200
 the daughter? Is it a risk for the daughter's boyfriend? Daughter has a boyfriend? Is it a risk

33:19.200 --> 33:26.480
 for the malamute that they have the dog? But for the vaccinated parents by vaccinated in-laws,

33:26.480 --> 33:30.800
 they're actually going to be much safer. Passive vaccination. We just talked a little bit about

33:30.800 --> 33:38.720
 the monoclonal. So the, the Eli Lilly product, the Regeneron cocktail, the Eli Lilly cocktail in the

33:38.720 --> 33:45.440
 past, monoclonal are still being underutilized. But as I mentioned, they're ready to go. They're

33:45.440 --> 33:50.800
 here to meet the challenge of any changes in the genetic code of the virus. All right. So now

33:50.800 --> 33:56.800
 this is the bulk, as though we haven't already done the bulk, lots on anticoagulation this week.

33:56.800 --> 34:01.280
 So I don't want to keep this too long, but let's hit this. This is really critical because now we

34:01.280 --> 34:05.840
 have new information that is actually changing some of the decisions that I'm making and some of

34:05.840 --> 34:11.920
 the recommendations I'm making in the hospital. So based on the interim results of more than a

34:11.920 --> 34:18.480
 thousand patients admitted to the hospital, findings from three large randomized control trials showed

34:18.480 --> 34:23.840
 that full doses of blood thinners, in addition to being safe, were superior to the doses

34:23.840 --> 34:30.080
 normally given to prevent blood clots in hospitalized patients with moderately severe COVID-19. So

34:30.080 --> 34:36.720
 these trials complement the findings announced in December that the routine use of full dose

34:36.720 --> 34:43.440
 anticoagulation when started in the ICU in critically ill COVID-19 patients was not beneficial and

34:43.440 --> 34:48.480
 may be harmful. So just to break this down before I go through the weeds, your critically ill patient

34:48.480 --> 34:55.040
 in the ICU with lots of lines, severely ill, the evidence that we have to date is favoring

34:55.040 --> 35:00.400
 prophylactic dosing. It doesn't really necessarily go along with what we were thinking, but your

35:00.400 --> 35:08.320
 floor patient who's maybe laying there in bed who's on oxygen, they actually are at lower risk of

35:08.320 --> 35:14.000
 bleeding and they actually do better with full dose anticoagulation. So how does this fit in with

35:14.000 --> 35:19.040
 our guidelines and how do we move forward and what are the actual studies? So the current guidelines

35:19.040 --> 35:25.040
 from the American Society of Humanology are the ash guideline panel suggests using these were made

35:25.040 --> 35:30.880
 a while back prophylactic intensity over intermediate or therapeutic intensity anticoagulation in

35:30.880 --> 35:37.280
 patients with COVID-19 related acute illness who do not have suspected or confirmed VTE.

35:38.080 --> 35:42.080
 And then we mentioned this is a conditional recommendation based on very low certainty

35:42.080 --> 35:47.520
 in the evidence about effects. And then added to this, the panel acknowledges that higher

35:47.520 --> 35:53.200
 intensity anticoagulation may be preferred in patients judged to be at high thrombotic risk

35:53.200 --> 35:59.040
 and low risk of bleeding. And then we actually add the interim data from these studies will

35:59.040 --> 36:04.160
 eventually be available in peer reviewed articles, but right now let me run through all the data

36:04.160 --> 36:10.720
 here. So the three clinical trial platforms spanned five continents, more than 300 hospitals

36:11.760 --> 36:16.080
 together were able to test whether there was a greater benefit of full doses of blood thinners

36:16.720 --> 36:22.640
 to moderately ill hospitalized patients with COVID-19 compared to the lower dose typically

36:22.640 --> 36:28.800
 administered to prevent blood clots in hospitalized patients. So let's go through the studies.

36:28.800 --> 36:35.680
 We have the ATT ACC. This is the anti-thrombotics inpatient and anti-thrombotic therapy

36:35.680 --> 36:42.960
 to emulate complications of COVID-19 with 58 sites in Canada, the US, Brazil and Mexico.

36:42.960 --> 36:50.320
 We have active for a therapeutic anticoagulation accelerating COVID-19 therapeutic interventions

36:50.320 --> 36:57.760
 and vaccines for, and this was 60 sites in USA in Spain. And we have RamCap,

36:57.760 --> 37:03.200
 randomized embedded multi-factorial adaptive platform trial for community acquired pneumonia,

37:03.200 --> 37:12.960
 209 sites, 290 sites. So this is very robust in Canada, the USA, UK, Ireland, EU, Saudi Arabia,

37:12.960 --> 37:19.600
 Australia, New Zealand, Nepal, India, Pakistan. And this, I have to say this is impressive.

37:19.600 --> 37:25.520
 There was a collaboration between all these studies and they agreed to create a multi-platform

37:25.520 --> 37:30.400
 randomized controlled trials with harmonized protocols. So they all agreed to use common

37:30.400 --> 37:36.640
 primary, common secondary and safety outcomes, and also to have common combined prospective

37:36.640 --> 37:44.320
 superiority and futility rules. So all the enrollees in all sites had to have signed in symptoms

37:44.320 --> 37:50.800
 consistent with COVID-19. So this is all symptomatic COVID-19. And then they were randomized within

37:50.800 --> 37:57.200
 72 hours of admission. And the primary outcome was organ support free days. And then they had

37:57.200 --> 38:01.600
 several key secondary outcomes. So from the safety, they were looking at major bleeding.

38:02.560 --> 38:08.400
 From efficacy, they were looking at mortality, intubation, major thrombosis, stroke,

38:08.400 --> 38:12.480
 am I, length of stay in the ICU and hospital. And then this is critical because I'm going

38:12.480 --> 38:16.800
 to get back to this. They risk stratified. They thought they were risk stratifying people based

38:16.800 --> 38:23.120
 upon the D dimer level. So you looked at people with D dimers that were low, less than two times

38:23.120 --> 38:28.320
 the upper limb abnormal. And then they looked at people that had elevated D dimer, so greater

38:28.320 --> 38:34.640
 than two times the upper limb abnormal. The reason I want to point this out right here is that this

38:34.640 --> 38:38.720
 did not impact the recommendations. And I'm going to have to say this several times because people,

38:38.720 --> 38:43.200
 it's very hard to get away from this. We as clinicians, we love to measure stuff. We love to have

38:43.200 --> 38:48.800
 something objective to guide us. We think of D dimer as an indication of people developing

38:48.800 --> 38:54.560
 thrombotic complication. And I just want to point out here, whether the D dimer was low or high,

38:54.560 --> 39:01.040
 the recommendations still stand. And when you put all this together, the primary outcome

39:01.040 --> 39:07.040
 of organ free support days favored full dose anticoagulation for moderate COVID-19.

39:07.040 --> 39:13.520
 As far as secondary outcomes, mortality was lower with full dose anticoagulation for moderate

39:13.520 --> 39:19.840
 COVID-19. Major bleeding was seen with full dose anticoagulation, but was less than 2%.

39:20.640 --> 39:26.640
 Thrombotic events were less common with full dose anticoagulation. But to recap the other side,

39:26.640 --> 39:33.440
 persevere COVID-19, those patients requiring ICU level support. The probability that routine use

39:33.440 --> 39:40.080
 of therapeutic anticoagulation was inferior was 98.5%, mainly you were seeing major bleeding

39:40.080 --> 39:47.680
 complications of 3.7% in the ICU patients, which really sort of backfired against us with that

39:47.680 --> 39:52.240
 full dose anticoagulation. So your floor patients, the science currently suggests full dose.

39:53.280 --> 39:57.280
 But if you're in the ICU, you want to watch the bleeding complications. I know we're going to

39:57.280 --> 40:01.520
 probably getting near our limit here, but I sort of want to make sure I discuss guidelines and what

40:01.520 --> 40:06.160
 they are, because we had a lot of conversation about this the last time at the Ash guideline

40:06.160 --> 40:12.240
 meeting. And what we were discussing is we, unfortunately, people have not really understood

40:12.240 --> 40:16.560
 what guidelines were. And guidelines have changed in the time of COVID. And I think a lot of people

40:16.560 --> 40:21.040
 have been promoted to positions of responsibility with their force to make these decisions,

40:21.040 --> 40:26.320
 but they themselves never served on a guideline committee before. Maybe they never helped construct

40:26.320 --> 40:31.920
 guidelines, but now they're sort of putting these in place. And so we talked a little bit

40:31.920 --> 40:38.720
 about how this was a challenge. So we've already added language, actually, to the Ash website,

40:39.680 --> 40:45.600
 trying to clarify what a guideline is and how is it expected to be used. These are not rigid

40:45.600 --> 40:53.200
 rules for patient care. And we do sort of encourage people to individualize their management decisions

40:53.200 --> 41:00.080
 to tailor them to a specific patient. And we've added an individualized assessment of the patient's

41:00.080 --> 41:05.600
 risk of thrombosis and bleeding is important when deciding on anticoagulation intensity.

41:06.160 --> 41:11.760
 Clinicians should weigh the potential benefits and harms based on the most up-to-date available

41:11.760 --> 41:16.800
 evidence in caring for their patients. So we're trying to communicate that these are

41:16.800 --> 41:21.840
 only guidelines. They're established to help direct physicians to deliver the best care

41:21.840 --> 41:27.680
 for their patients. And even though these are living documents updated on a regular basis,

41:27.680 --> 41:33.600
 by their very nature, they will not be the most up-to-date based upon available evidence.

41:34.400 --> 41:40.000
 So I'm just going to hit three sort of scenario cases, examples. Case one, just sort of what would

41:40.000 --> 41:47.360
 we do. This is a police officer in his 40s. His oxygen saturation is 88% on room air. He has no

41:47.360 --> 41:52.560
 significant medical problems. He's standing up. He's looking out the window. When can I go?

41:52.560 --> 41:57.360
 He's being treated with remdesivir and steroids. That's an individual I still might stick with

41:57.360 --> 42:03.760
 just prophylactic dosing, right? He's ambulating. He's low-risk. Case two, we have an OB, 75-year-old

42:03.760 --> 42:09.760
 man. He's somulin. He's on six liters nasal cannula. He has coronary artery disease, CHF and diabetes.

42:10.480 --> 42:15.520
 That's a man. Now I'm going to recommend full dose anticoagulation. Case three, a woman. She's an

42:15.520 --> 42:23.520
 ICU. She's intubated. She's prone. She has low ematocrit. She's on medications to maintain her blood

42:23.520 --> 42:30.000
 pressure called pressers. She has staphorus, bacteria, multiple IVs. She's got a central line.

42:30.720 --> 42:35.920
 This is a woman that I'm going to recommend prophylactic dose anticoagulation. So I'm going

42:35.920 --> 42:41.120
 to sort of make sure I just mentioned the tail phase, but then I'm going to update people on

42:41.120 --> 42:47.120
 our fundraiser. So as we move into our fundraiser, I'm going to use an analogy from my honorary cousin,

42:47.120 --> 42:51.360
 Peter Dates, about oxygen masks and airplanes. And you know how they always tell you like when

42:51.360 --> 42:55.840
 those oxygen masks come down, put them on yourself first. But then the point I'm going to say here

42:55.840 --> 43:02.160
 is once you have that mask on you, make sure that you put that mask on other people. So

43:02.160 --> 43:11.280
 throughout the months of February and March, we're going to be making donations to the ASTM

43:11.280 --> 43:17.920
 and NH. So donations made to parasites of that borders will be matched and doubled by TWB,

43:17.920 --> 43:23.040
 PWB, and donated to the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene. And this money

43:23.040 --> 43:29.760
 is going to include scholarships for women from low-income parts of the world to travel to the

43:29.760 --> 43:35.360
 annual meeting. So we're going to pledge a, hopefully we're going to get up to a maximum 40,000, but

43:35.360 --> 43:40.640
 we are going to donate a minimum of $20,000. And part of that is going to go for these

43:41.840 --> 43:48.720
 scholarship travel awards to basically prioritize females from low-income countries,

43:48.720 --> 43:54.480
 who otherwise might not be able to attend. So it goes back to where I started. We are not safe

43:54.480 --> 43:59.280
 until everyone is safe. We're seeing vaccines roll out here in the United States that all may

43:59.280 --> 44:04.320
 be exciting, but we're not safe until everyone's safe. Let's not forget about the rest of the world.

44:04.320 --> 44:09.280
 A couple of email for Daniel. If you want to send in a question, Daniel at microbe.tv,

44:09.280 --> 44:15.600
 the first is from Debbie, who wants to advise a friend on setting daughters back to school in

44:15.600 --> 44:22.080
 Maryland, where they're living in an underfunded school district, has an incredible plan to bring

44:22.080 --> 44:28.720
 students back, small cohorts, air filters, distancing dividers at desks, etc. But she says the only

44:28.720 --> 44:33.840
 thing that's missing is testing. I thought nothing is perfect, but air quality, cohorting,

44:33.840 --> 44:37.120
 and testing were what I thought of as deal breakers, your thoughts.

44:37.120 --> 44:43.760
 Yeah, you know, this continues to be, you know, a really frustrating challenge is that people

44:43.760 --> 44:49.280
 leave testing out. I mean, all these other things cost money too, right? You start smaller class

44:49.280 --> 44:53.600
 sizes, you start doing all these mitigation strategies, and then they leave testing out.

44:53.600 --> 44:59.600
 So one of the things, Debbie, I'm going to suggest you do, let's see where you are. You're in

44:59.600 --> 45:06.480
 Maryland. What I'm going to say is reach out to one of the local provider groups in the area,

45:07.040 --> 45:10.960
 because a lot of times we've done this at Pro Health New York. We've done this at Riverside.

45:10.960 --> 45:16.480
 We've created the whole Let's Get Back program is, you know, sometimes the schools just leave

45:16.480 --> 45:21.280
 this out for some reason. And if they do, there's no reason why parents and teachers organizations

45:21.280 --> 45:26.400
 can't jump in and we can't create something. In my local town, it's actually one of our

45:26.400 --> 45:31.280
 Pro Health providers has been working with the school. And it took a long time that they finally

45:31.280 --> 45:38.080
 introduced testing. And testing is really, I think, part of creating the best possible solution.

45:38.800 --> 45:42.560
 President Biden has said he really wants to get the teachers back. He really wants to get the

45:42.560 --> 45:48.320
 kids back and in person. That's fine and all, but we've got to make sure we do everything to make

45:48.320 --> 45:52.880
 it safe. So this is a safe decision. And I think testing is part of that.

45:54.160 --> 46:01.680
 Terry in Orlando has a 100 year old mom who got her first dose and is preparing for the second.

46:01.680 --> 46:07.440
 And Terry wants to know, is there anything that we should do to prepare her? And how long should

46:07.440 --> 46:10.080
 someone stay with her afterwards to monitor her?

46:11.360 --> 46:16.240
 Yeah. So, you know, the nice thing about older individuals that I know this was discussed on

46:16.240 --> 46:22.640
 the last wave, is they either have less side effects, or they just complain less than young

46:22.640 --> 46:28.400
 people, right? Young people are so horrible. I had to take pain medications. No, I think your

46:28.400 --> 46:34.320
 healthy 100 year old mom is actually going to do very well. The observation period we recommend

46:34.320 --> 46:39.920
 is really 15 minutes after the vaccination. No one really needs to stay with your mom. It would be

46:39.920 --> 46:44.480
 nice if you stayed with your mom. But again, you want to weigh, you know, are you vaccinated? Is

46:44.480 --> 46:49.520
 there a risk of exposure? But she's getting so close to being out the other side of this.

46:50.160 --> 46:53.840
 You know, ask her doctor whether it's safe at a 100 year old woman with whatever medical

46:53.840 --> 47:00.720
 problem she has to use something like ibuprofen or a leave or Tylenol. But no, I think that there's

47:00.720 --> 47:05.360
 nothing too much that I would worry about here. And she has one more question. Her daughter

47:05.360 --> 47:11.440
 is breastfeeding. Her 10 month old grandson, is there any chance if she is still breastfeeding when

47:11.440 --> 47:16.720
 she is vaccinated that any protection will reach the grandson? And how far down the road do you think

47:16.720 --> 47:22.160
 will be the earliest we expect one year olds to be vaccinated? Yeah, so breastfeeding. And I think

47:22.160 --> 47:28.480
 I posted my friend Vanessa, one of my coworkers who she is breastfeeding mother who is vaccinated.

47:28.480 --> 47:33.280
 That's one of the things like breast vaccinating a breastfeeding woman is really vaccinating two

47:33.280 --> 47:39.120
 people. We anticipate and this has been true for all our other vaccines that when a woman starts

47:39.120 --> 47:45.600
 making antibodies, those antibodies are then in the breast milk. So if she is vaccinated,

47:45.600 --> 47:51.920
 once she starts making those robust levels of antibodies, we anticipate that those are being

47:51.920 --> 47:59.120
 then transmitted to the 10 month old grandson. There are some trials looking at younger individuals.

47:59.760 --> 48:04.480
 It's probably going to be a while before we look at one year olds. I know there was a question

48:04.480 --> 48:09.200
 about, okay, so if you have, if you say this is allowable for this, are you allowed to stretch

48:09.200 --> 48:13.520
 beyond that? So for instance, I'll say that J and J vaccines been given hundreds of thousands

48:13.520 --> 48:20.000
 of individuals. You know, will it, will it be okay to give those to children? Unfortunately,

48:20.000 --> 48:25.920
 it may be quite a while before we have any science to guide this. So there may be judgment calls at

48:25.920 --> 48:30.960
 some point. All right, one more from Carson. You've said that people who recently had COVID

48:30.960 --> 48:37.040
 should still get vaccinated, but also that anyone who's had monoclonal therapy needs to wait 90 days

48:37.040 --> 48:41.520
 because the monoclonals could prevent the person from mounting a sufficient immune response to the

48:41.520 --> 48:46.400
 vaccine. Why isn't that the case for someone who's been infected and presumably develop their own

48:46.400 --> 48:50.480
 antibodies? Yeah, no, this is this is an excellent question, right? And I'm going to bring two things.

48:50.480 --> 48:57.520
 So I had a conversation with my partner, Nujali earlier today, a conversation with Fatima Johari,

48:57.520 --> 49:03.680
 one of the the infectious disease doctors I work with at Plainview about sort of these two topics.

49:04.320 --> 49:11.600
 And one was it was a husband and wife, and the husband had been vaccinated. And he's

49:12.640 --> 49:20.880
 well, got just like so many, he got infected before his second second vaccine dose. And

49:21.440 --> 49:25.600
 you know, he meets criteria for monoclonal antibodies, but he doesn't want to get the monoclonal antibodies

49:25.600 --> 49:29.680
 because as he explained, it was so hard to get the appointments for the vaccine. If I missed this,

49:29.680 --> 49:34.080
 I'll never get another one. And you know, try to explain that if he gets the monoclonals,

49:34.800 --> 49:39.520
 we have we have the impression and actually the evidence that those are going to be in his system

49:39.520 --> 49:43.680
 for 90 days. So in a sense, instead of waiting for that second dose and another two weeks for the

49:43.680 --> 49:48.640
 antibodies, so three weeks from now, you know, within an hour, he could instantly have that

49:48.640 --> 49:52.640
 passive immunity that lasts three months at the end of those three months, then he can go ahead

49:52.640 --> 49:59.040
 and get his vaccine and get that boost. But what about this? This is this issue. What about someone

49:59.040 --> 50:04.720
 who's already had an infection? Why not just wait three months just like you did with anybody

50:04.720 --> 50:09.920
 therapies? And you'll hear different advice on this. This for me gets back to that rule,

50:09.920 --> 50:15.680
 never miss an opportunity to vaccinate. If someone is ready and willing right now to get vaccinated,

50:15.680 --> 50:20.800
 and you can give them that protection, which we have well studied, which we're familiar with,

50:20.800 --> 50:27.120
 which we are learning more and more about the durability. And all the science suggests that it

50:27.120 --> 50:35.120
 is even better than natural infection. That's why I'm saying there's no need to wait. Three months,

50:35.120 --> 50:39.040
 maybe that person's lost interest and they decide they don't want to get vaccinated. So you've just

50:39.040 --> 50:45.360
 lost the opportunity to immunize. And for us all to get out of this, for us to see the death count

50:45.360 --> 50:48.240
 drop, we want to see as many people vaccinated as possible.

50:48.240 --> 50:55.680
 That is COVID-19 clinical update number 48 with Dr. Daniel Griffin. Thanks again, Daniel.

50:55.680 --> 51:25.520
 Oh, my pleasure. Everyone be safe.
