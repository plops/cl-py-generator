 This week in virology, the podcast about viruses, the kind that make you sick.

00:10.400 --> 00:21.040
 From MicrobeTV, this is Twiv, this week in virology. Episode 787, recorded on July 29, 2021.

00:21.680 --> 00:27.680
 I'm Vincent Racken-Yellow, and you're listening to the podcast all about viruses. Joining me

00:27.680 --> 00:34.960
 today from New York, Daniel Griffin. Hello, everyone. Well, you got the 787, Daniel.

00:36.160 --> 00:41.120
 Okay, in the show notes, right? There's a nice picture of a large aircraft.

00:41.120 --> 00:46.960
 Have you ever flown one of those 787s? I don't think so. Actually, no, I haven't. I've been on

00:46.960 --> 00:52.720
 some of the bigger air buses, but never the 787s. So I flew one. I only flew one once to

00:52.720 --> 00:59.040
 Singapore from San Francisco in December 2019, and it's a very comfortable plane, very nice.

00:59.680 --> 01:04.000
 You were one of those private little suites, right? I was back in the

01:04.640 --> 01:09.360
 coach, but it's an 18-hour flight, so it was a bit rough.

01:10.240 --> 01:13.760
 Wow. Yeah, that's a long flight. A long flight. You take a nap and you wake up,

01:13.760 --> 01:18.880
 and you say, I must be there, and you got another 16 hours to go. Are you wearing a mask, Daniel?

01:18.880 --> 01:25.440
 At the moment, no, but when I, you know, I never stopped wearing masks when I went to the gym,

01:25.440 --> 01:31.440
 or when I went to the grocery store or other places, and we're going to be touching on that.

01:31.440 --> 01:39.360
 So let's get going. All right, start off with my quotation. I would rather have questions that

01:39.360 --> 01:45.280
 can't be answered than answers that can't be questioned. And that's by Richard Feynman,

01:45.280 --> 01:52.160
 so anyone who just listened to Twiv, what, 786? Rich Condit. I give him a little credit to Rich

01:52.160 --> 01:58.800
 Condit, who I think is also a fan of Richard Feynman. And actually, you know, on some

01:58.800 --> 02:03.760
 aside, sometime I'll tell a side story about the connection with Richard Feynman. But

02:04.640 --> 02:10.080
 I think that this is what science is about. Science is about asking questions, trying to get

02:10.080 --> 02:16.560
 answered. There shouldn't be dogma. People shouldn't be afraid to ask questions, to try to discover

02:16.560 --> 02:22.640
 things. Actually, just talking to Dixon de Pomeier earlier today, and I sang a little bit of a rise

02:22.640 --> 02:30.160
 in the hate mail I've been receiving recently. I did an article in the Washington Post where I,

02:30.160 --> 02:35.440
 you know, bemoan that we didn't have better therapies. And of course, I got lots of emails

02:35.440 --> 02:40.800
 about what are you talking about, Dr. Griffin, you know, and then all the less than pleasant

02:40.800 --> 02:46.960
 adjectives, crimes against humanity, other things in all caps about, you know, if only everyone in

02:46.960 --> 02:54.880
 the world had access to Ivermectin and HCQ, we would all be fine. So we'll touch and don't worry,

02:54.880 --> 02:59.360
 I'll make sure I mention Ivermectin, you know, won't let an episode go by without that. But

02:59.360 --> 03:05.600
 what is the big thing that happened this week? The CDC updated their guidance,

03:06.160 --> 03:12.960
 and boy, did this really get a lot of people confused, angry. So let's spend a little time

03:12.960 --> 03:19.040
 going through that. What exactly did they say? What did they post? And then we'll speculate or

03:19.040 --> 03:26.000
 discuss a little bit on what is behind this. So I actually thought this was pretty reasonable

03:26.000 --> 03:31.120
 on the surface. I feel like this should have been something that came out before they dropped

03:31.120 --> 03:35.360
 the mass mandate just to give a little context about like public health, because that's really

03:35.360 --> 03:44.960
 what this is. And what the CDC said posted until vaccination coverage is high and community transmission

03:44.960 --> 03:51.520
 is low, public health practitioners, as well as schools, businesses, institutions, organizations

03:51.520 --> 03:57.200
 need to regularly assess the need for preventive strategies to avoid stress and stressing health

03:57.200 --> 04:04.800
 care capacity, and imperiling adequate care for both COVID-19 and other non-COVID-19

04:04.800 --> 04:12.240
 conditions. Right, I mean, that's just sort of reasonable. And then the CDC recommended five

04:12.240 --> 04:20.080
 critical factors that should inform local decision making. One, you should keep an eye on the level

04:20.080 --> 04:26.800
 of SARS-CoV-2 community transmission. Two, you should keep an eye on your health system capacity.

04:27.600 --> 04:35.360
 Three, you need to keep an eye on COVID-19 vaccination coverage. Four, look at capacity

04:35.360 --> 04:42.240
 for early detection of increases in COVID-19 cases. And number five, you need to be aware of

04:42.240 --> 04:48.720
 which populations are at increased risk for severe outcomes from COVID-19. And I really,

04:48.720 --> 04:53.200
 I'm going to sort of, you know, little criticism to the CDC. It would have been nice to have this

04:53.200 --> 04:59.040
 out front when they said a little while back that they felt like things were at a level where it was

04:59.040 --> 05:06.240
 appropriate to get the masks off. But here's what the CDC went on to say. And this is when

05:06.240 --> 05:14.320
 people got upset. Among strategies to prevent COVID-19, CDC recommends all unvaccinated persons

05:14.320 --> 05:22.000
 wear masks in public indoor settings. Okay, so far, so good. Based on emerging evidence on the

05:22.000 --> 05:29.520
 Delta variant, the CDC also recommends that fully vaccinated persons wear masks in public indoor

05:29.520 --> 05:36.480
 settings in areas of substantial or high transmission. Fully vaccinated persons might consider wearing

05:36.480 --> 05:42.320
 a mask in public indoor settings regardless of transmission level. Or if they or someone in their

05:42.320 --> 05:47.680
 household is immunocompromised, or is it increased risk for severe disease, or if someone in their

05:47.680 --> 05:53.600
 household is unvaccinated, including children aged less than 12. Vincent, do you have any thoughts?

05:54.560 --> 06:01.520
 So yes, I do. They shouldn't have relaxed the masking back in April, because vaccine coverage

06:01.520 --> 06:08.720
 was less than it is now. So I don't see why they have to go back. However, what is it? What

06:08.720 --> 06:15.040
 does the Delta variant have to do? Any different from any other variant? I don't see the vaccines

06:15.040 --> 06:22.240
 prevent severe diseases you have said with any variant. So why this concern about the Delta

06:22.240 --> 06:28.880
 variant? Do they have some data which drives that decision? Yeah, some special super double

06:28.880 --> 06:36.320
 secret information. Do you remember back in December when you and I talked about how everyone in the

06:36.320 --> 06:42.480
 UK and in December, Boris Johnson decided that we could take December off from the pandemic and

06:42.480 --> 06:46.960
 everyone could go to the pubs and the taverns and have a good old time. And then suddenly,

06:46.960 --> 06:53.600
 the Alpha variant came along and changed everything. Yeah, I think the variants are becoming a bit

06:53.600 --> 06:59.520
 of a scapegoat. You know, we saw a huge surge after July 4th. We saw a lot of people indoors

07:00.080 --> 07:06.160
 transmitting. And I think there's a couple things in here that we've talked about, but maybe we

07:06.160 --> 07:12.640
 need to reinforce. One is that unvaccinated people can get infected and transmit to others. I think

07:12.640 --> 07:19.040
 we all know that the other is vaccinated people can get infected and transmit to others, particularly

07:19.040 --> 07:25.360
 symptomatic vaccinated people. And I think we have growing data that the farther we get out from those

07:25.360 --> 07:34.880
 jabs, the higher the risk is for people to get mild symptomatic case of COVID-19 despite vaccination

07:34.880 --> 07:41.440
 and spread it to others. So I am not sure that throwing the Delta variant in here really tells

07:41.440 --> 07:50.720
 us very much. And there is this sort of buzz that there's some PCR data out there, you know, about PCR

07:50.720 --> 07:56.160
 levels being similar, RNA amplification levels being similar. And we're going to talk about that

07:56.160 --> 08:00.960
 when we get to testing. But I think Vincent and I, you were on this, you and I are on the same page.

08:00.960 --> 08:09.680
 You know, what is more significant behavior or a few substitutions in the spike protein?

08:10.480 --> 08:14.880
 I think it's behavior. And yeah, dropping the mass mandate was a little bit premature.

08:15.520 --> 08:21.440
 But we've got to sort of reinforce that, you know, as my mom was saying about a bulletproof vest,

08:21.440 --> 08:25.120
 I don't understand how you think that's going to protect you when your head is sticking out.

08:25.120 --> 08:33.280
 So children, COVID and mental health, right? So where there's a lot of concern, right, about

08:33.280 --> 08:40.080
 vaccinations and the fact that some of our children are not going to be eligible when the school's

08:40.080 --> 08:48.720
 open. And there is significant concern about, you know, what we can do to make those schools

08:48.720 --> 08:56.480
 safer. So I'm going to start off by discussing an MMWR, so Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report,

08:56.480 --> 09:04.320
 an early release came out. SARS-CoV-2 infections in public school district employees following a

09:04.320 --> 09:11.520
 district-wide vaccination program, Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania, March 21 through April 23,

09:11.520 --> 09:18.960
 2021. And this is this concept that if the school employees, if teachers are all vaccinated,

09:18.960 --> 09:23.840
 does this create a safer environment for the children? You know, will this prevent those

09:24.400 --> 09:28.320
 employees' staff from becoming infected, potentially spreading it to the children?

09:28.320 --> 09:33.520
 So this addressed that question of whether promoting vaccination among school staff members

09:34.240 --> 09:40.000
 could potentially make our schools safer. So the school district of Philadelphia reopened for

09:40.000 --> 09:46.560
 in-school instruction the week of March 21, 2021, right? So this is a number of months back,

09:46.560 --> 09:53.120
 so we're going to see data from the spring. They required weekly testing for SARS-CoV-2,

09:53.120 --> 09:58.800
 the virus that causes COVID-19, for all employees returning to in-school responsibilities.

09:59.840 --> 10:04.080
 The resumption of in-school instruction followed a mass vaccination program

10:04.080 --> 10:11.600
 using the Pfizer-BioNTech 2-dose mRNA vaccine offered under a partnership between the Philadelphia

10:11.600 --> 10:20.240
 Department of Public Health and Children's Hospital of Philadelphia CHOP, to all the 22,808 school

10:20.240 --> 10:26.880
 district of Philadelphia employees. Now, the mandatory, this was a mandatory testing program,

10:26.880 --> 10:34.080
 provided an opportunity to assess the percentage of positive by-necks now, point-of-care antigen

10:34.080 --> 10:40.640
 tests identified among school staff members based upon their self-reported vaccination status.

10:40.640 --> 10:45.280
 So we're going to be able to see vaccinated, non-vaccinated, and what happened as far as

10:45.280 --> 10:54.800
 positive tests. So they found a 95% reduction in the percentage of positive SARS-CoV-2 test results

10:54.800 --> 11:03.840
 among persons who had reported receipt of two doses of the vaccine compared with those who had not

11:03.840 --> 11:10.560
 been vaccinated. So they concluded that vaccination of school staff members is an important,

11:10.560 --> 11:16.080
 potential, important strategy to maximize the safety of indoor person education of K through 12

11:16.080 --> 11:21.120
 students this fall. So I have to say, this is actually pretty interesting, right? This is not

11:21.120 --> 11:26.640
 looking at protection against hospitalization or severe disease. This is looking at the vaccine's

11:26.640 --> 11:32.960
 ability to prevent people from even testing positive. I'm looking at Vincent, to see if he has a

11:32.960 --> 11:40.640
 comment. I think it's kind of contradictory to what we've been hearing lately, right? Out of Israel,

11:40.640 --> 11:46.400
 people are getting infected after vaccination. So I think my view is that the further you get

11:46.400 --> 11:51.360
 out from the second dose, your antibodies level drop, you're more likely to get infected. This

11:51.360 --> 11:56.480
 was probably done early on, and that's why the infection was prevented. But it's a good indicator

11:56.480 --> 12:01.040
 that they could vaccinate everybody in schools, right? Yeah, no. And I actually think that's

12:01.040 --> 12:05.520
 important. I mean, this is the nice thing I think about the TWIV audience is our TWIV audience.

12:05.520 --> 12:13.120
 We are educating up there. We're good with nuance here in this TWIV world. This was, as you point

12:13.120 --> 12:17.120
 out, Vincent, this was done right after vaccination. This is people with the really high antibody

12:17.120 --> 12:24.400
 levels, mucosal surfaces. This is that window, we'll talk about how long that window is in a

12:24.400 --> 12:30.240
 science paper later, where that vaccine not only protects you against severe disease but is giving

12:30.240 --> 12:36.880
 you this herd immunity impact, actually blocking infection and transmission. All right, so let's go,

12:36.880 --> 12:44.240
 you know, kids, it's something I was just reading today. I read the Texas papers. I don't know if

12:44.240 --> 12:51.680
 you read the Houston papers there, the Houston press. But in the Houston press, maybe Rich Condit,

12:51.680 --> 12:56.880
 I don't know, he's down there in Austin, maybe Houston is, you know, close enough. But this was

12:56.880 --> 13:03.520
 in the Houston press, out of all the kids who show up to Texas children's concern that they may have

13:03.520 --> 13:11.200
 COVID, roughly 10% of the children who tested positive required hospitalizations, and roughly

13:11.200 --> 13:16.640
 a third of those ended up requiring critical care. Now, this is concerning on the surface,

13:16.640 --> 13:21.520
 but what exactly does it mean? I want to make a couple comments. You know, when it does point

13:21.520 --> 13:28.240
 out that children can get sick with COVID, children can end up in the hospital. But this is a select

13:28.240 --> 13:33.520
 population, right? These are children who are symptomatic. When a child's brought to the hospital,

13:33.520 --> 13:39.200
 there's usually an impression by the parent or the provider that this is a child with a more

13:39.200 --> 13:44.960
 serious manifestation. Historically, those numbers have been down around 1% or less.

13:45.840 --> 13:50.960
 And so we'll just we'll keep an eye on this. I think I would be shocked and frightened and

13:50.960 --> 13:57.360
 bewildered if really 10% of children end up requiring hospitalization with COVID. I did not think

13:57.360 --> 14:02.800
 SARS-CoV-2 has changed its biology enough to affect that, but we will see. But it is important

14:02.800 --> 14:07.920
 to realize that kids can get COVID, kids can end up in the hospital, kids can end up on ventilators,

14:08.960 --> 14:15.920
 kids can have adverse impacts. Testing, just sort of a brief reminder or primer,

14:16.480 --> 14:21.600
 because we're going to be hearing now about CT values. And I think that's great. The conversation

14:21.600 --> 14:26.880
 is getting a little more sophisticated, but you don't want to have just a little bit of knowledge

14:26.880 --> 14:32.800
 or enough knowledge to make you dangerous. So let's talk a little bit about the really two

14:32.800 --> 14:39.360
 large category of tests that we use. We use PCR or molecular amplification tests.

14:39.360 --> 14:46.720
 These amplify RNA and give us RNA copy numbers when we look at that CT value or

14:46.720 --> 14:53.120
 cycle threshold. This is a test for RNA. It's not actually a viral load. It does not give us

14:53.120 --> 14:58.400
 number of infectious variants. And I think that's really critical, because we're going to talk a

14:58.400 --> 15:06.960
 little bit later on, perhaps, about does an RNA copy number in a vaccinated person mean the same

15:06.960 --> 15:13.360
 thing as an RNA copy number in a person who is unvaccinated, who is not potentially destroying

15:13.360 --> 15:21.920
 or neutralizing those variants. The other test that we use quite often, and hopefully more and more,

15:21.920 --> 15:27.840
 is the antigen test that by next now that we talked about, a couple other ones that BD

15:27.840 --> 15:35.440
 Veratore, Quidel, Sophia, the antigen tests are not looking for RNA. They are looking for proteins,

15:35.440 --> 15:41.760
 and particularly the immunodominant protein, the nucleocapsid proteins. So this requires,

15:41.760 --> 15:47.680
 these tests require that that protein is produced and present in sufficient quantities.

15:47.680 --> 15:53.840
 Now, we know at the front end of infection, we start to see those antigen tests turn positive

15:53.840 --> 16:01.360
 in an unvaccinated person when the RNA copy number gets above 50,000. And then the same sort of number

16:01.360 --> 16:07.520
 as it drops off the tail several days later. But remember, those, that information, and we're

16:07.520 --> 16:14.880
 going to hit some studies here, come from the unvaccinated viral kinetics. So antigen tests

16:14.880 --> 16:21.680
 historically have correlated very well with individuals being infectious. Active vaccination

16:21.680 --> 16:26.960
 never missed an opportunity to vaccinate, and vaccination is how this pandemic ends.

16:27.600 --> 16:33.360
 So I don't know if people remember or know the Harry Met Sally movie, I don't know Vincent if

16:33.360 --> 16:40.000
 that's a favorite of yours. Not a favorite, but I've heard of it. Okay, well, I will recommend

16:40.000 --> 16:46.560
 rewatching it. You know, we all need a little break. But this is a movie with Billy Crystal and

16:46.560 --> 16:51.440
 Meg Ryan. And there's this restaurant scene where Sally, played by Meg Ryan, is ordering,

16:51.440 --> 16:55.280
 and she says to the waiter, waiter, I'll begin with the house salad, but I don't want the regular

16:55.280 --> 16:59.520
 dressing. I'll have the balsamic vinegar and oil, but on the side, and then the salmon with

16:59.520 --> 17:04.320
 the mustard sauce, but I want the mustard sauce on the side. And I remember as a child thinking,

17:04.320 --> 17:11.440
 can you do that? Don't you just take what's on the menu? And I feel like we're seeing with the

17:11.440 --> 17:18.000
 COVID vaccines a bit a little bit of what I'll call the Harry Met Sally phenomenon. We have these

17:18.000 --> 17:24.160
 well studied vaccines, dosing regimens, but people want to order something not on the well

17:24.160 --> 17:30.560
 studied menu. Like maybe I'll just take one of those mRNA vaccine doses. And maybe I want to

17:30.560 --> 17:36.880
 sort of change the interval of what's being done or what's being recommended. So we just had this

17:36.880 --> 17:46.480
 article, original article, effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines against the B1617.2 Delta variant. So

17:46.480 --> 17:52.560
 you get the different nomenclature there in the New England Journal of Medicine. And the authors

17:52.560 --> 17:58.320
 used a case control design to estimate the effectiveness of vaccination against symptomatic

17:58.320 --> 18:06.080
 disease caused by the Delta variant, comparing this to the alpha variant over the period that the

18:06.640 --> 18:13.280
 Delta variant began circulating. So variants were identified with sequencing of the of the S or

18:13.280 --> 18:20.240
 the spike gene data on all symptomatic sequence cases in England were used to estimate the proportion

18:20.240 --> 18:26.560
 of cases with either variant according to the patient's vaccination status. They found that the

18:26.560 --> 18:32.880
 effectiveness of just that one dose was notably lower among persons with the Delta variant,

18:32.880 --> 18:41.280
 only 30.7 percent with the alpha variant, 48.7 percent. They report the results were pretty

18:41.280 --> 18:48.480
 similar for both vaccines after just that first dose. Now, when you went to two doses of the mRNA,

18:48.480 --> 18:58.240
 Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, 93.7 percent with the alpha variant, 88 percent with the Delta variant.

18:58.240 --> 19:06.160
 Now, the the Chadox, the AstraZeneca vaccine, the effectiveness of two doses was 74.5 with the

19:06.160 --> 19:11.600
 alpha variant, 67 percent with the Delta variant. So I just want to point out, because I know there's

19:11.600 --> 19:16.480
 a lot of discussion now about maybe we should wait, maybe we should change the interval for that

19:16.480 --> 19:23.200
 second vaccine dose. And I just want to point out that after just that first dose, you're looking at

19:23.200 --> 19:28.880
 only about a 30 percent protection against the Delta variant, which is what is circulating. So

19:28.880 --> 19:34.560
 do you want to sit around there at 30.7 percent protection, hoping that if you wait a few extra

19:34.560 --> 19:39.040
 weeks, you're going to somehow tweak that 88 percent second dose impact a little higher. So

19:39.040 --> 19:46.480
 I'm going to say, don't be sally, just go ahead and get that second dose when recommended.

19:46.480 --> 19:52.480
 Now, we also have, we still keep having questions about the third dose, the booster dose.

19:53.520 --> 20:01.920
 So we had another paper, and this was antibody response after a third dose of the mRNA 1273 SARS

20:01.920 --> 20:08.000
 COV-2 vaccine in kidney transplant recipients with minimal serological response to two doses

20:08.000 --> 20:14.080
 published in JAMA. So that's the Moderna vaccine, the Moderna mRNA vaccine that we're talking about.

20:14.800 --> 20:18.880
 And the findings were very similar to other investigations we've discussed with

20:18.880 --> 20:23.440
 low responders getting some increase in antibody responses with a third dose,

20:24.320 --> 20:30.400
 and about 49 percent of kidney transplant recipients who did not respond having detectable

20:30.400 --> 20:36.800
 antibody levels after two doses did after a third dose in the case of the Moderna mRNA

20:36.800 --> 20:43.120
 vaccine. And I will point out they did not assess the T cell responses. Now this ties into what's

20:43.120 --> 20:48.640
 happening to these people, are they getting sick? What is sort of the story? So in the journal

20:48.640 --> 20:55.600
 Kidney International, unfortunately behind a paywall, the article occurrence of severe COVID-19

20:55.600 --> 21:02.080
 in vaccinated transplant patients was published. And here the authors described 55 solid organ

21:02.080 --> 21:09.600
 transplant recipients, 52 kidney, three simultaneous kidney pancreas, who went on to develop COVID-19

21:09.600 --> 21:15.760
 after receiving two doses of mRNA-based vaccines. So of these 55 patients,

21:17.040 --> 21:23.280
 27 percent required hospitalization for oxygen therapy. It's a little bit higher than we would

21:23.280 --> 21:29.520
 think in our generalized unvaccinated population, right? Of these six were admitted to the ICU three

21:29.520 --> 21:36.960
 ended up dying. They had information on 25 patients with available data on the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies

21:37.920 --> 21:46.320
 between the second dose and the onset of the COVID-19 symptoms. 24, so about half, had negative

21:46.320 --> 21:54.080
 serology. One was positive but had weak antibodies. So just a little bit of information we're getting

21:54.080 --> 21:59.520
 here trying to figure out what to do with this with this group. I will just say, currently,

22:00.560 --> 22:06.400
 we have not started to recommend booster or third doses. But just we are studying this,

22:06.400 --> 22:11.360
 we're trying to get a sense of what might happen in the future. I'm going to call this next paper

22:11.360 --> 22:18.720
 the optimistic one. I think we need a little optimistic paper here. The paper protection afforded

22:18.720 --> 22:29.040
 by the BNT-162B2 and mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccines in fully vaccinated cohorts with and without prior

22:29.040 --> 22:34.560
 infection. This was posted as a preprint, right? So we get a lot of questions about this. The

22:34.560 --> 22:43.040
 authors assessed the effect of prior infection in Qatar, QATAR, where the alpha and beta variants

22:43.040 --> 22:49.680
 were dominant during this period of time. And they used two national retrospective matched cohort

22:49.680 --> 22:58.000
 studies, one for the Pfizer biotech vaccine, one for the Moderna mRNA vaccine. They reported that

22:58.000 --> 23:03.920
 the incident rates of infection among the Pfizer vaccinated persons with and without prior infection

23:03.920 --> 23:12.560
 were respectively 1.6 or 11 for 10,000 person weeks. They looked at this in people with the

23:12.560 --> 23:22.320
 Moderna vaccine, 1.5 versus 1.83 per 10,000 person weeks. So they actually found that prior

23:22.320 --> 23:29.040
 infection enhanced protection of those that received the Pfizer vaccinated, but they really

23:29.040 --> 23:34.160
 didn't see a difference here with the Moderna vaccine. It actually saw pretty low rates with

23:34.160 --> 23:40.400
 Moderna vaccinated individuals, whether or not they had pre-existing infection. So sort of interesting.

23:40.400 --> 23:48.880
 Now, hot off the press, Amy just sent me this. And so I sent her back and said, hey, this is

23:48.880 --> 23:54.560
 already on the block to discuss. And this was an article in the journal Science,

23:55.120 --> 24:03.840
 Immune Correlates of Protection by mRNA 1273 vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 in non-human primates,

24:03.840 --> 24:09.760
 right? So this is the Moderna mRNA vaccine. And I liked it, but I just want to change the title.

24:10.800 --> 24:15.680
 If we change the title, I think we're all really good here. This is really immune

24:15.680 --> 24:22.160
 correlates of decreased viral replication. And the authors even have a section heading entitled

24:22.160 --> 24:29.760
 antibody responses correlate with protection against SARS-CoV-2 replication. And the authors

24:29.760 --> 24:34.800
 do demonstrate that the levels of the anti-S antibody and neutralizing activity correlate

24:34.800 --> 24:41.440
 with reduction in viral replication in Bronco alveolar lavages. So that's when you put a tube down,

24:41.440 --> 24:47.520
 you put in saline, you wash it out, you pull it back out, and nasal swabs following SARS-CoV-2

24:47.520 --> 24:53.520
 challenge in vaccinated animals. There's a lot in this paper, but they do also go on to show,

24:53.520 --> 24:59.360
 I think this is interesting, that lower antibody levels were needed for reduction of viral replication

24:59.360 --> 25:06.240
 down in the lower airways compared to the upper airways. They also report a dose-dependent response.

25:06.880 --> 25:13.040
 And this actually correlated with the S-specific T follicular helper cells that activate the B cells

25:13.040 --> 25:20.320
 to secrete IgG, and the canonical cytokine IL-2 was also correlated with dose. So I think this

25:20.320 --> 25:25.200
 sort of goes with the discussion, Vincent, that you and I were having earlier, that high antibody

25:25.200 --> 25:30.800
 levels may have some impact on the ability of the virus to replicate in our airways, particularly

25:30.800 --> 25:37.600
 the upper airways. But this is not really a correlate of protection, it's a correlate of

25:38.320 --> 25:44.800
 reduction in SARS-CoV-2 replication. It's not a real world thing. We want to know in people

25:44.800 --> 25:51.680
 what protects you against severe disease, right? And this doesn't tell us that, unfortunately.

25:51.680 --> 25:58.000
 Yeah, I mean, I think it is, and I'll say, it would be great if we had vaccines that had high

25:58.000 --> 26:02.320
 degrees of sterilizing immunity. If once you were vaccinated, you could not be infected,

26:02.320 --> 26:08.000
 you could not transmit, you would be a dead end if you were exposed. I think that was actually

26:08.000 --> 26:15.360
 discussed on 786-12, that we're not even sure how many of those vaccines really are out there,

26:15.360 --> 26:20.880
 whether or not the HPV or the measles even do that. But yeah, this is going to be a challenge

26:20.880 --> 26:26.160
 if we're looking for, quote-unquote, herd or community immunity, how much can the vaccines

26:26.160 --> 26:31.200
 really play a part in that unless you're getting vaccinated every three months or something along

26:31.200 --> 26:36.720
 those lines. The period of detectable viral replication, what I like to say is the time for

26:36.720 --> 26:43.280
 monitoring and monoclonals, not the time for antibiotics. Remember, this is a virus. We have

26:43.280 --> 26:50.560
 anti-virals. No, not so many great choices here in the COVID world. We have anti-bacterial

26:50.560 --> 26:56.960
 cells that target bacteria. We have anti-parasitic drugs that target parasites. This is a virus.

26:56.960 --> 27:03.520
 So, do we think that antibiotics, anti-bacterial agents will work? Well, a lot of physicians

27:03.520 --> 27:08.000
 seem to feel that, a lot of patients feel that, but we have to have another paper that tells us,

27:08.000 --> 27:14.560
 yes, water is wet, fire is hot, and this was the Lancet respiratory medicine publication

27:14.560 --> 27:20.960
 Doxycycline for community treatment of suspected COVID-19 in people at high risk of adverse outcomes

27:20.960 --> 27:26.480
 in the UK. This is the principal study, a randomized controlled open label adaptive

27:26.480 --> 27:33.520
 platform trial. So, the background here is that Doxycycline is often used for treating COVID-19

27:33.520 --> 27:38.560
 respiratory symptoms in the community, despite an absence of evidence from clinical trials to

27:38.560 --> 27:44.480
 support the issues. And there's a lot of hand waving about it interfering with the virus and

27:44.480 --> 27:49.840
 in vitro assays and having anti-inflammatory immune modulating effects, et cetera.

27:50.800 --> 27:56.480
 So, this data comes from this trial, the principal, and was performed in primary care

27:56.480 --> 28:04.480
 centers in the UK. 2,689 participants were enrolled and randomized. And the authors found

28:04.480 --> 28:09.440
 that in patients with suspected COVID-19 in the community in the UK, who were at high risk of

28:09.440 --> 28:16.320
 adverse outcomes, treatment with Doxycycline was not associated with any clinically meaningful

28:16.320 --> 28:22.080
 reductions in time to recovery, hospital admissions, or deaths related to COVID-19,

28:22.080 --> 28:28.720
 and should not be used in the routine treatment for COVID-19. The whole comment that there were

28:28.720 --> 28:35.120
 780 folks in the Doxycycline group, 978 in the control group. There were five deaths in the

28:35.120 --> 28:41.760
 Doxycycline group, only two in control. So, that's like more than double. I do not think

28:41.760 --> 28:47.040
 that Doxycycline is something we should be using for COVID-19. The science does not support it.

28:47.040 --> 28:52.880
 What do we end up with? An unnecessary intervention and an increase in antibiotic resistance.

28:52.880 --> 28:56.000
 The early inflammatory phase, this is when they show up in the hospital,

28:56.880 --> 29:02.800
 still not much new here. We're still steroids, tosyllizumab, if they progress to our higher

29:02.800 --> 29:09.200
 oxygen need, prophylactic dose anticoagulation in general, adjusted to higher dose in specific

29:09.200 --> 29:16.960
 situations. We are still waiting for more therapies, both in the early viral phase as well as this

29:16.960 --> 29:22.800
 phase. We're hearing it may not be until October and November before we get small molecule inhibitors

29:22.800 --> 29:28.960
 specifically targeting SARS-CoV-2. So, we're still in July, so we still have a little bit more time

29:28.960 --> 29:36.400
 to go. All right, and to the end, the tail phase, the long COVID or the post-cute COVID phase.

29:37.520 --> 29:43.600
 Lately, we've been hearing a lot about the neurological impacts about acute COVID.

29:44.400 --> 29:50.480
 Now, there was an article, The Lancet, Child and Adolescent Health. The peer-reviewed article

29:50.480 --> 29:57.600
 appeared in this journal. Neurological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2, infection in hospitalized children

29:57.600 --> 30:04.160
 adolescents in the UK, a prospective national cohort study, and the authors performed a prospective

30:04.160 --> 30:11.520
 national cohort study in the UK looking at children adolescents, age less than 18, admitted to hospital

30:12.480 --> 30:18.480
 with neurological or psychiatric disorders in whom they considered SARS-CoV-2 infection to be

30:18.480 --> 30:25.440
 relevant to the presentation. They identified 1334 children and adolescents hospitalized with

30:25.440 --> 30:34.880
 COVID-19 and reported a prevalence of 3.8%. Neurological psychiatric disorders following

30:34.880 --> 30:42.560
 hospitalization for COVID-19. So, 3.8% of these adolescents and children that have been hospitalized

30:42.560 --> 30:48.400
 for COVID-19 went on to have neurological or psychiatric disorders. So, that's about 1 in 25.

30:48.400 --> 30:55.280
 The diagnosis included seizures, encephalitis, that's inflammation of the brain,

30:55.280 --> 31:02.160
 Guillain-Barre, acute demyelinating syndromes, Korea, which is these uncontrolled movements,

31:02.160 --> 31:09.840
 psychosis, psychosis, encephalopathy, transient ischemic attack, even one child had a stroke.

31:09.840 --> 31:14.880
 So, you can just imagine how devastating. So, again, I try to give people a balance here between

31:14.880 --> 31:20.880
 the risks of COVID in children, should they require hospitalization versus the risks associated

31:20.880 --> 31:28.080
 with vaccination. So, I think this helps to give us more information around the decision making

31:28.080 --> 31:33.600
 with regard to vaccination and mitigation strategies for children. We're still working to get solid

31:33.600 --> 31:40.480
 numbers, but the risk for children, death is rare, hundreds of children have died of COVID here in

31:40.480 --> 31:47.120
 the US. Hospitalization is uncommon. Thousands have ended up in the hospital. I think in the UK,

31:47.120 --> 31:54.960
 they already have over 1,000 hospitalizations in just July, and long COVID seems to be a

31:54.960 --> 31:59.760
 significant risk. Now, this last article, this could be the last article we hit on.

32:00.400 --> 32:06.640
 This was in the New England Journal of Medicine, COVID-19 breakthrough infections in vaccinated

32:06.640 --> 32:11.200
 healthcare workers. Now, the B word is in the title, so I couldn't leave that out.

32:12.800 --> 32:20.560
 The authors reported on infections in vaccinated healthcare workers, and they looked at 1,497

32:20.560 --> 32:29.760
 fully vaccinated healthcare workers for whom RTPCR data was available. 39 SARS-CoV-2 infections

32:29.760 --> 32:38.800
 was documented in this 1,497 person cohort. They calculate an infection rate of 0.4%,

32:39.680 --> 32:44.640
 less than half a percent. There were a few interesting findings. They reported of

32:45.760 --> 32:52.720
 these individuals, 74% of the case patients had a high RNA level. I'm translating here because

32:52.720 --> 32:58.000
 they call it viral load, but I'm going to say this is a CT value. This is an RNA copy number,

32:58.000 --> 33:05.280
 74% of the individuals had a CT value of less than 30 at some point during their infection.

33:05.280 --> 33:13.360
 However, of these patients, 59, only 59% had a positive, concordant, antigen,

33:13.360 --> 33:19.040
 rapid detection test. I think this is kind of interesting, and I just want our listeners to

33:19.040 --> 33:26.080
 think a little bit about what does a CT value mean. We know the relationship between CT values

33:26.080 --> 33:34.160
 or RNA copy numbers and infectiousness in unvaccinated people, but what does this mean

33:34.160 --> 33:40.800
 in vaccinated individuals? They also reported that neutralizing antibody titers in case patients

33:40.800 --> 33:46.960
 during the peri infection period were lower than those in matched, uninfected controls.

33:46.960 --> 33:51.680
 Not clear if that's a marker for people with other risk issues or if that's actually a causal

33:51.680 --> 33:59.200
 connection. There is a figure three where that correlation, if you look at the figure, it's

33:59.200 --> 34:03.520
 not really that impressed, but I will leave it up to our readers to go ahead and take a look.

34:03.520 --> 34:09.920
 This is not behind a paywall. They did report that most of the breakthrough cases were mild or

34:09.920 --> 34:16.000
 asymptomatic, but here was a bit of why is this in the long COVID section of the people that had

34:16.000 --> 34:22.320
 symptomatic infections post-vaccination? And remember, this was a small amount. This was less than 1%,

34:22.960 --> 34:28.000
 19% of those people that did have a symptomatic case went on to have persistent symptoms for

34:28.000 --> 34:34.480
 greater than six weeks. So I'm sort of put this in context. Getting a symptomatic infection post

34:34.480 --> 34:41.280
 vaccine is very uncommon, but it does happen, but should you get that, it actually looks like a

34:41.280 --> 34:48.480
 pretty similar rate of long COVID in these individuals. So pretty on par with unvaccinated.

34:49.040 --> 34:52.880
 What's going on the rest of the world? I think this is important for us to keep an eye on that.

34:52.880 --> 34:59.120
 We continue to see rising case rates and deaths with much of the world still being a vaccine

34:59.120 --> 35:05.280
 desert. I like to say no one is safe until everyone is safe and we are far from that at this point.

35:06.160 --> 35:10.720
 Whether it's to protect ourselves or through altruism, this pandemic does not end until we

35:10.720 --> 35:16.720
 have widespread access and acceptance of vaccines. So I want to thank everyone who's

35:16.720 --> 35:22.640
 continuing to go to parasites without borders.com clicking on the donate button. This is going to

35:22.640 --> 35:29.200
 drop the last day of July. We're trying to make that $20,000 donation level so that we can give a

35:29.200 --> 35:35.120
 full $40,000 to support Foundation International Medical Relief of Children. They've actually

35:35.120 --> 35:41.200
 started to open up some of their travels to some of their sites. So brighter, brighter days on the

35:41.200 --> 35:46.880
 on the horizon, but this work is going to require funding and support. So please help us support

35:46.880 --> 35:54.720
 femric. Daniel, that last paper is of consequence to the CDC decision on masking, which is based on

35:54.720 --> 36:01.920
 this PCR equivalence between Delta vaccinated and Delta unvaccinated would suggest that that's

36:01.920 --> 36:08.640
 flawed, right? In their case. Yeah, I think that that's really a problem. One is it looks like the

36:08.640 --> 36:14.400
 people who are vaccinated are very like less than 1% risk of even testing positive. And then if they

36:14.400 --> 36:20.480
 do test positive, you can't just use CT values because you're looking at RNA. It's not viral load.

36:21.120 --> 36:29.360
 And I sort of hope that the CDC isn't making that. Can we call it a rookie mistake? You need to

36:29.360 --> 36:35.280
 ask. And I think the fact that we're not picking up antigen that we're not seeing the protein

36:35.280 --> 36:40.960
 production does really suggest that maybe that RNA level is not correlating with infectious

36:41.680 --> 36:44.160
 virus. Yep. And we need a little more data.

36:45.520 --> 36:54.800
 Yep. The other thing, Daniel, I wasn't a call yesterday from Mumbai. And one of the women on the

36:54.800 --> 37:00.080
 call said they have immunized 450 million people in India.

37:01.040 --> 37:05.920
 Wow. That is impressive. Now, compared to the US, that's very impressive.

37:07.440 --> 37:12.800
 We'd be done if we had done that in the US. They, but it's not even half of their population,

37:12.800 --> 37:20.240
 right? But she said, in India, we don't have a problem with people getting vaccinated.

37:20.240 --> 37:27.440
 Interesting. I mean, I think I shared, and this is one of this week in paracetism,

37:27.440 --> 37:31.680
 where I was talking about Ben Lebrot. We were in one of these little communities,

37:32.400 --> 37:39.280
 and we were talking to one of the women, no-bay woman, about the fact that in the United States,

37:39.280 --> 37:44.160
 we actually have people that do not want to vaccinate their children. And she looked at

37:44.160 --> 37:48.880
 us a little confused, and she said, but don't your parents love their children in America?

37:48.880 --> 37:59.600
 Yeah. Indeed, indeed. Okay, time for some email questions for Daniel. You can send yours to

37:59.600 --> 38:05.360
 Daniel at microbe.tv. The first is from Alan, a gastroenterologist in New York.

38:06.080 --> 38:13.280
 If a fully vaccinated patient who was in a high risk group age over 65 or medical comorbidities

38:13.280 --> 38:19.200
 developed an early COVID infection, would you recommend monoclonal antibody with the level of

38:19.200 --> 38:24.080
 the patient's COVID antibody obtained at the time of infection, make a difference in deciding the

38:24.080 --> 38:30.160
 treatment? I realize there may not be any randomized trials for this type of situation. However,

38:30.160 --> 38:35.680
 clinicians frequently have to make decisions in the absence of good data or good studies.

38:36.880 --> 38:40.800
 This is an excellent question, and I'm going to break it down into two parts.

38:40.800 --> 38:46.640
 So let's say this is a person who's been vaccinated. They've not been infected with COVID before.

38:46.640 --> 38:51.520
 They're in that first week, and I'm going to throw the person who's been infected before

38:51.520 --> 38:56.880
 also vaccinated in that first week. We do recommend monoclonal antibody therapy in those

38:56.880 --> 39:03.360
 individuals. Your prior vaccination status does not impact your eligibility or our recommendation

39:03.360 --> 39:09.440
 for monoclonal antibody therapy. Now, I will say, have we repeated the studies with vaccinated

39:09.440 --> 39:14.560
 people to see if we're still getting that 70 to 80% reduction in progression? We have not,

39:15.600 --> 39:20.240
 but we're not excluding people who are vaccinated. The other little twist, so let's say you're not

39:20.240 --> 39:27.440
 sure about the timing, and this person has not been infected with SARS-CoV-2 before,

39:27.440 --> 39:32.880
 you can check a nuclear capsid antibody test to see, are you really catching them early

39:32.880 --> 39:38.640
 before they start producing their own antibodies? Because that really is what we've seen as far as

39:38.640 --> 39:44.720
 the benefit of monoclonals. If you can give people the monoclonals prior to them developing

39:44.720 --> 39:49.040
 their own antibodies, those are the patients that we see the most benefit. And I just

39:49.040 --> 39:54.000
 recently had a case where it was really unclear to me. A person was cognitively not 100%.

39:55.200 --> 40:00.080
 Sounded to me like we were only two or three days in. We did a stat nuclear capsid antibody.

40:00.080 --> 40:06.000
 It was negative, and I went ahead and recommended monoclonals. But no, we have not repeated these

40:06.000 --> 40:12.400
 monoclonal studies in vaccinated people. But if they've broken through, gotten a symptomatic case,

40:12.960 --> 40:16.560
 I think it makes sense not only to reduce the hospitalization and death rate,

40:17.120 --> 40:21.440
 and we're working on data because maybe it's also going to impact their risk of long COVID.

40:23.200 --> 40:26.880
 Linda writes, I wanted to understand the role of at-home,

40:27.600 --> 40:33.440
 rapid antigen tests for the vaccinated person following exposure to a COVID positive vaccinated

40:33.440 --> 40:38.640
 individual. Currently, as I understand New York rules, no quarantine or testing is required for

40:38.640 --> 40:43.440
 the vaccinated person that's been exposed. I find that a tad concerning and wanted to protect my

40:43.440 --> 40:49.280
 family, no one in a high risk category, and friends following such an exposure, and so have been

40:49.280 --> 40:54.320
 wearing a mask at home and limiting my exposures to others for what will be seven days, timing of

40:54.320 --> 40:58.480
 my choice based on my own review of the current debates. I'm not sure what the magic number of

40:58.480 --> 41:02.960
 days should be, particularly as I go on this frolic of my own, since no one is telling me I

41:02.960 --> 41:07.680
 have to do anything other than wear mask indoors. I feel like there's a role for the at-home

41:07.680 --> 41:12.480
 antigen test in this setting and consider doing it at days three, then six. I just really don't

41:12.480 --> 41:18.080
 know what the reasonable approach is following close exposure to a COVID positive vaccinated

41:18.080 --> 41:22.800
 individual. Can you explain if the at-home antigen test plays a useful role in this context?

41:23.840 --> 41:29.120
 Yeah, so this is a fantastic question. We have great listeners, or maybe Vincent just picks

41:29.120 --> 41:35.280
 out the really great listener questions, but so we'll give everyone credit here. But we do know

41:35.280 --> 41:42.640
 that a vaccinated person can develop a symptomatic case of COVID-19 and can transmit to others,

41:42.640 --> 41:48.480
 right? Not only is that well-described, but I've seen several cases myself. Can any

41:48.480 --> 41:55.040
 asymptomatic vaccinated person get enough virus that they're going to transmit to someone else?

41:55.040 --> 42:00.800
 A bit of uncertainty there. We could use some better data. The last study we talked about

42:01.360 --> 42:07.840
 were these individuals who are fully vaccinated got infection. We're talking about 0.2% actually

42:07.840 --> 42:13.680
 had a positive antigen test. We're in sort of, we need a little more information here.

42:14.240 --> 42:19.840
 If it turns out that vaccinated people only transmit, this is sort of case control and tracking

42:19.840 --> 42:26.400
 studies. If they only transmit with symptoms, that's helpful. But I think if you're trying to be on

42:26.400 --> 42:34.080
 the side of extra caution, you are vaccinated, you've had an exposure, you may be pre-symptomatic,

42:34.080 --> 42:38.640
 right? Because you can't get symptomatic. I think that the antigen test is a reasonable

42:38.640 --> 42:43.840
 extra layer. So remember, always looking at layers, looking at people's different risk tolerances,

42:43.840 --> 42:50.560
 and I think it can factor into that. Gabriel writes, a friend of mine suffers from

42:50.560 --> 42:56.560
 Bruton's agamoglobulinemia, and many medical doctors in Ecuador do not recommend any COVID

42:56.560 --> 43:01.440
 vaccine for him. I'm a microbiologist. I've carried out research and immunology, and though I understand

43:01.440 --> 43:05.840
 that he can't produce antibodies, the T cell responses should be fine. I don't see any risks

43:05.840 --> 43:10.000
 of getting vaccinated. I would appreciate your opinion about whether he should receive vaccine,

43:10.000 --> 43:17.200
 what kind of vaccine would be better. So I definitely would encourage vaccination. I think we've tried

43:17.200 --> 43:24.480
 to reinforce several times that there's more than one arm of the immune system. I'd say two,

43:24.480 --> 43:28.640
 that's a little simplistic, but there's the B cell antibody production. We're not going to get

43:28.640 --> 43:35.760
 that with Bruton's agamoglobulinemia, but we should be able to get a protective T cell response.

43:35.760 --> 43:41.920
 And our data, our understanding of immunology suggests that it's that T cell response that

43:41.920 --> 43:48.480
 is really critical in protection against severe disease, hospitalization, and death. So I definitely

43:48.480 --> 43:55.280
 would encourage vaccination. I would say whatever vaccine you can get access to, I would go ahead.

43:55.280 --> 44:02.400
 Don't be picky. Don't be sally. And the last is from Abby, which is really a comment, but we

44:02.400 --> 44:08.640
 should read the Peds New York here. My daughter was 17 in early March 2020 when I brought COVID

44:08.640 --> 44:15.600
 home from the Peds clinic. She had mild illness was a fit rugby player still having GI issues,

44:15.600 --> 44:21.600
 neurological symptoms, tachycardia, fatigue, brain fog, depression, couldn't eat lost 20 pounds.

44:21.600 --> 44:27.040
 We need more parents to learn about long COVID. Many docs are saying it's mild in kids and they

44:27.040 --> 44:33.520
 are just as at fault, not vaccinating their own kids. Millions of kids with this around the world.

44:35.040 --> 44:40.160
 Yeah, you know, Vincent, we keep seeing these sort of scoreboards, dashboards,

44:40.880 --> 44:45.280
 you know, Hopkins world demeanor, and they have number of cases, they have hospitalizations,

44:45.280 --> 44:50.720
 they have deaths. What they are missing is long COVID. And I think that that's a critical number

44:50.720 --> 44:56.800
 as well. So when we see pretty soon, over 100,000 cases a day here in the US, welcome to

44:56.800 --> 45:02.080
 August, I'm predicting, you know, what percent of those individuals are going to continue to be

45:02.080 --> 45:06.080
 ill. And I think that's really an important thing. And so when you look at kids and you say,

45:06.080 --> 45:12.640
 oh, kids, well, we can see the deaths, we can see the hospitalizations, but what about the long

45:12.640 --> 45:17.680
 term, you know, greater than four weeks, greater than 12 weeks of long COVID. And I think stories

45:17.680 --> 45:22.480
 like this parent parents need to hear because parents are not necessarily swayed by scientific

45:22.480 --> 45:29.040
 studies, they're swayed by stories, by people sharing these experiences. So as I sort of brought

45:29.040 --> 45:34.720
 out last time having conversations about vaccines, you know, if your child has suffered, let's

45:34.720 --> 45:39.680
 share these stories because we do not need even one more child suffering with long COVID.

45:39.680 --> 45:46.080
 That's COVID-19 clinical update number 73 with Dr. Daniel Griffin. Thank you, Daniel.

45:46.080 --> 45:52.880
 Oh, thank you. And everyone, be safe.
