 This week in virology, the podcast about viruses, the kind that make you sick.

00:10.400 --> 00:21.040
 From Microbe TV, this is Twiv, this week in virology. Episode 808 recorded on September 23, 2021.

00:21.680 --> 00:27.680
 I'm Vincent Draconiello, and you're listening to the podcast all about viruses. Joining me today

00:27.680 --> 00:36.880
 from New York, Daniel Griffin. Hello, everyone. Episode 81, or I should say clinical update,

00:36.880 --> 00:45.600
 number 81, Daniel. My question for today, when do you think five to 12-year-olds will get vaccinated?

00:46.320 --> 00:52.800
 You know, that's going to be right in my first section on children and COVID, Vincent.

00:52.800 --> 00:57.600
 All right. I feel like you've preempted it, but let's get going and we'll get right there.

00:57.600 --> 01:04.400
 So I will start off with a quotation, no pessimist ever discovered the secret of the stars,

01:04.400 --> 01:09.600
 or sailed to an uncharted land, or opened a new doorway for the human spirit.

01:10.320 --> 01:15.920
 And that is Helen Keller. And next to the Helen Keller Institute is just down the road from me,

01:15.920 --> 01:21.760
 prior to the pandemic, prior to me slipping on a wet surface and tearing the lateral medial

01:21.760 --> 01:27.600
 meniscus in my left knee, my family and I would all do the Helen Keller fundraiser yearly run. So

01:28.320 --> 01:33.040
 maybe at some point when I can free up some time in my schedule to fix that knee, I'll be doing that

01:33.040 --> 01:42.800
 again. But what an inspirational woman. As far as an update, you know, people, it's so regional

01:42.800 --> 01:48.880
 in our country. It's so regional in the world, right? What's been happening? We are seeing things

01:48.880 --> 01:55.360
 get a little bit better, particularly here in the New York area. You know, part of what I tell

01:55.360 --> 02:00.240
 people when they ask me, this is only so many people that can get infected or vaccinated. So

02:01.440 --> 02:07.280
 there is, you know, there is that. But let's get right into children. So we have some, I'm going to

02:07.280 --> 02:14.720
 say exciting things on the horizon or that we're hearing here. And I think finally people have

02:14.720 --> 02:18.640
 come to realize that children are at risk for COVID. I think that's just sort of black

02:18.640 --> 02:24.000
 and white. That was really a bit of a mistake and it's unfortunate. You know, if we say we're

02:24.000 --> 02:29.920
 still seeing about a quarter million children a week get infected. We're seeing thousands of

02:29.920 --> 02:35.120
 children end up in the hospital. We're seeing a number of children die every week here in the

02:35.120 --> 02:41.520
 U.S. and worldwide that continues. I've talked about resources in the past. Not only can you go

02:41.520 --> 02:48.560
 to the AAP site, not only can you go to the special CDC pediatric data, I'm going to throw

02:48.560 --> 02:57.440
 another site at you and this is COVID net and this is at GIS.cdc.gov. And here you can actually

02:57.440 --> 03:03.040
 break down by age what is going on with regard to different things, particularly hospitalizations.

03:03.040 --> 03:09.360
 And it's a bit disturbing when you look at the rate of hospitalization per 100,000 broken down by

03:09.360 --> 03:16.960
 individuals under 18. And the highest is in the zero to four really, really disturbing.

03:16.960 --> 03:22.640
 The youngest children are being impacted. So we're going to talk about a couple things today

03:22.640 --> 03:28.960
 about what might be done to help those individuals. And saying that we're going to talk first about

03:30.080 --> 03:36.960
 children, people aged five to 12. So straight to vaccines for five to 12. So on Monday,

03:36.960 --> 03:41.920
 September 20th at 6.45 AM, I think everyone, you got to get up at 6.44 and be ready for these

03:41.920 --> 03:48.160
 headlines. We saw the press release from Pfizer with the headline Pfizer and biotech announced

03:48.160 --> 03:54.640
 positive top line results from pivotal trial of COVID-19 vaccine in children five to 11 years.

03:55.600 --> 04:02.880
 And so Pfizer and BioNTech announced results from a phase two, three trial showing a favorable

04:02.880 --> 04:09.200
 safety profile and robust neutralizing anybody responses in children five to 11 years of age

04:09.200 --> 04:18.400
 using a two dose regimen of 10 micrograms administered 21 days apart, a smaller dose than the 30

04:18.400 --> 04:23.200
 micrograms that's currently be used in people 12 and older. So all right, so that's the headline.

04:23.200 --> 04:28.000
 But what was the what was the data? We don't have it all. It's not peer reviewed. We're going to get

04:28.000 --> 04:36.880
 more coming. But in this trial, they reported data from 2,268 participants age five to 11 years

04:36.880 --> 04:42.960
 of age. And they reported that the SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody geometric mean titer

04:42.960 --> 04:55.360
 was 1,197.6, one month after the first dose in this group compared to 1,146.5 from participants

04:55.360 --> 05:02.000
 aged 16 to 25 who had gotten the 30 microgram. That was the control group. So really, you're

05:02.000 --> 05:08.560
 getting about the same confidence interval overlap. Really, the median mean there geometric mean

05:08.560 --> 05:16.320
 is actually a higher higher. So the point here, and I think we need to talk about this a little,

05:16.320 --> 05:21.040
 is this is exciting news. You're seeing this robust response. You're seeing that a smaller

05:21.040 --> 05:27.280
 dose can be used. So don't just go out and use the 30 microgram dose off label. Pfizer is in

05:27.280 --> 05:34.480
 preparation to go ahead and make these smaller doses. They're going to new production challenges

05:34.480 --> 05:40.320
 to make this happen. For the United States, the companies expect to include this data in a near

05:40.320 --> 05:47.520
 term submission for EUA as they continue to accumulate safety and efficacy data.

05:48.560 --> 05:55.200
 But a couple things, and I'm sure this will be a discussion, this is a 2,268. So we say safety

05:55.200 --> 06:02.400
 data. That's a small number of individuals. As this rolls out in the first four to eight weeks,

06:02.400 --> 06:08.880
 we're going to get what we call phase four data where we have post-marketing. So there will be

06:08.880 --> 06:13.760
 some parents. I'm sure that we'll want to wait a few extra weeks. And this is going to be sort of

06:13.760 --> 06:19.520
 that balance between what we're seeing now with quarter million individuals here in the US alone

06:19.520 --> 06:23.440
 getting infected thousands in the hospital. Parents will want to weigh that risk benefit

06:23.440 --> 06:27.920
 during the first four to eight weeks as we get even more safety data on this age group.

06:29.120 --> 06:35.600
 Daniel, how do you figure out 10 micrograms? And it's from going from 11 to 12 years,

06:36.320 --> 06:42.880
 it seems like a sharp cut. How does that work? Yes. No, I still remember, right? Like,

06:44.160 --> 06:52.960
 Barnaby turned 16. He was going to almost qualify, and then they dropped the EUA for

06:52.960 --> 06:57.840
 younger ages. So we were looking at Barnaby 15 years at nine months, and he didn't qualify for

06:57.840 --> 07:06.720
 the vaccine, but magically in three months. And then on the bottom end here, what about those

07:06.720 --> 07:13.200
 younger children? What about children who are two, three, and four? So your four years, your 11

07:13.200 --> 07:23.600
 months, maybe you're large for your age. So yeah, these cutoffs are not exact science. So,

07:25.200 --> 07:31.840
 yeah. But presumably they have some experience on dosing for different ages. And so they use that

07:31.840 --> 07:37.680
 to calculate 10 micrograms, I suppose, right? Well, you know, with the mRNA vaccines, we don't

07:37.680 --> 07:42.880
 have quite as much experience as we would like, right? So the amount of mRNA and the Moderna vaccine

07:42.880 --> 07:48.160
 is three times more. And maybe that will turn out to be relevant in some things that we discussed

07:48.160 --> 07:56.160
 later. Okay. All right. Now we move to that pre-exposure transmission testing period. I like to say

07:56.160 --> 08:04.960
 never miss an opportunity to test, to test, and remember, masks are cool. It appears that people

08:04.960 --> 08:12.960
 are finally catching on. And rapid tests, like monoclonals, are now in short supply. Rapid tests

08:12.960 --> 08:18.480
 are finally being embraced. And we have over-the-counter tests. But now you're searching everywhere to

08:18.480 --> 08:24.800
 try to find them, because they're being sold out across the country. So I think this reinforces a

08:24.800 --> 08:30.320
 message that Vincent, I'm going to thank you for getting Michael Menon to sort of spread this early

08:30.320 --> 08:36.400
 on, is rapid tests are a really excellent public health tool. And in that two days before symptom

08:36.400 --> 08:42.560
 onset, in that three to five days afterwards, these are incredibly sensitive and rapid ways

08:42.560 --> 08:49.760
 of detecting people who are contagious, detecting people who are acutely ill. If you need to repeat

08:49.760 --> 08:56.000
 that test the next day, we're talking about tests that cost five to $10 here in the US per test,

08:56.000 --> 09:02.000
 where results are back in 15 minutes versus results that take some areas of the country

09:02.000 --> 09:07.360
 talking to a colleague in Oregon, where it's about four days in some places to get that result back.

09:07.360 --> 09:14.880
 Exciting in this area, we heard that part of the $2 billion testing plan from the White House

09:14.880 --> 09:23.200
 involves buying 647 million over-the-counter rapid tests to help subsidize these, to help get them

09:23.200 --> 09:29.600
 out so we can actually get those results. All right, active vaccination, never miss an opportunity

09:29.600 --> 09:36.560
 to vaccinate. And I was listening to a little bit of the United Nations. And vaccination is how

09:36.560 --> 09:42.400
 this pandemic ends is actually a theme. So I think they've been listening to Twiv. So let's talk a

09:42.400 --> 09:47.600
 little bit about vaccines, the Jabs that keep you from getting sick. And a couple of things,

09:47.600 --> 09:53.600
 and the first will be boosters. Friday, September 17th, the FDA advisory panel met,

09:53.600 --> 09:58.960
 and it was very interesting. I think what was interesting was sort of like the live stream

09:58.960 --> 10:04.000
 media coverage. You know, here was a discussion, you know, started off with a first vote,

10:04.000 --> 10:08.880
 moved on to another vote. And the whole time, sort of, I think people were on the edge of their

10:08.880 --> 10:14.240
 seat waiting for the different updates. And it got messy at times. There were words used that I

10:14.240 --> 10:21.200
 don't use in my house and that we don't allow our children to use. But I thought it was a really

10:21.200 --> 10:26.800
 healthy discussion. And a big thing that came out of this was this reassuring. This guy is not

10:26.800 --> 10:34.080
 falling. There was some certain information that led to some of their recommendations. And then on

10:34.080 --> 10:43.040
 Wednesday, the 22nd of this September 2021, we heard that following this advisory board discussion

10:43.040 --> 10:50.240
 and vote that the FDA authorized booster dose of Pfizer biotech COVID-19 vaccine for certain

10:50.240 --> 10:58.400
 populations. And so the US FDA amended the emergency use authorization, the EUA, for the Pfizer

10:58.400 --> 11:06.720
 biotech COVID-19 vaccine to allow for a single booster dose to be administered at least six months

11:06.720 --> 11:11.040
 after the completion of the primary series in these three categories.

11:11.040 --> 11:18.160
 Individuals 65 years of age are older. Individuals 18 through 64 years of age at high risk of severe

11:18.160 --> 11:26.080
 COVID-19 and individuals 18 through 64 years of age, whose frequent institutional or occupational

11:26.080 --> 11:32.160
 exposure to SARS-CoV-2 puts them at high risk of serious complications of COVID-19, including

11:32.160 --> 11:40.000
 severe COVID-19. And this authorization for clarity only applies to Pfizer biotech COVID-19 vaccine.

11:40.000 --> 11:45.920
 So I'm going to pull you in on this, Vincent. But what basically came out of this was really a

11:45.920 --> 11:52.240
 public health decision. It was a risk benefit. It was very clear on Friday from the discussion

11:52.240 --> 11:57.760
 that all the data that these individuals want is not yet available. It's not yet been available

11:57.760 --> 12:02.640
 long enough for them to really go through it. So this was one of those public health decisions,

12:02.640 --> 12:09.280
 where it seemed reasonable and appropriate to extend the EUA. But the initial idea that

12:09.280 --> 12:16.560
 everyone, 18, 19, 20-year-olds should be getting third doses did not make sense, was not recommended

12:16.560 --> 12:22.000
 by that advisory committee. In the coming weeks, we're going to learn more. We're going to learn

12:22.000 --> 12:29.360
 a lot about when and who might get that second shot. We're also going to learn, is this just

12:29.360 --> 12:36.160
 a Pfizer specific? Is Pfizer now the three and you're done vaccine? Will Pfizer require in the

12:36.160 --> 12:43.360
 future yearly boosters? And then what is the situation with Moderna and J&J? And don't worry,

12:43.360 --> 12:47.600
 we have some exciting data on J&J to follow. So Vincent, I don't know if you had any thoughts?

12:49.040 --> 12:54.400
 So this is just for people who previously received Pfizer, correct?

12:54.400 --> 12:58.960
 People who previously got two shots of Pfizer and now a third shot.

12:58.960 --> 13:07.280
 So if you really think the science tells you to have a third shot, you have to make it everybody,

13:07.280 --> 13:12.560
 not just Pfizer. You have to make it Moderna too, even though they didn't apply for it. So

13:13.840 --> 13:19.200
 as I've said before, I don't see the data. If I were eligible, I wouldn't take it,

13:19.200 --> 13:24.400
 because I don't think you need it. And I think that as we discussed last time that paper,

13:24.400 --> 13:29.200
 that opinion paper in the Lancet really laid it well out, the science doesn't say you need it yet.

13:29.200 --> 13:33.280
 Yeah. And the science will come. And what we're also going to see, and this also,

13:33.280 --> 13:39.120
 I think is similar to echo what I talked about early on, is we are now seeing a number of

13:39.120 --> 13:43.600
 individuals. We already know a number of individuals went ahead and got that third shot. So we're

13:43.600 --> 13:49.600
 going to see in coming weeks here, a large number of millions of individuals who got Pfizer will

13:49.600 --> 13:56.240
 now get a third. The suggestion is that the reactogenicity is even lower with that third shot.

13:56.240 --> 14:01.040
 We'll see more safety signal. We'll get a little more of our data. And then, yeah,

14:02.240 --> 14:08.000
 recommendations coming soon. Here, I think is a really important thing. I want to discuss

14:08.000 --> 14:13.360
 vaccines and pregnant women. And I think it's really incumbent on physicians to be

14:13.360 --> 14:21.200
 very up to date on the data. And I know there's this, I'm going to say false dichotomy out there.

14:21.200 --> 14:28.720
 The idea that people who are unvaccinated are somehow bad people, anti-vaxxers.

14:29.920 --> 14:35.760
 And I'm going to talk about the fact that over 80% of pregnant individuals in the United States

14:35.760 --> 14:41.280
 are not vaccinated. I'm going to talk a little bit about these are actually intelligent

14:41.280 --> 14:45.840
 individuals who are trying to make the right choice for themselves, for their unborn baby,

14:45.840 --> 14:52.400
 and talk a little bit about what is the information we have. I think people may remember this initially

14:52.400 --> 14:59.200
 started off focused on physicians. But I think this is expanded beyond that. But here again,

14:59.200 --> 15:04.080
 I want to focus on physicians to have this information, but also all of our listeners

15:04.080 --> 15:10.320
 have the information about COVID vaccines in pregnancy, so that these decisions can be

15:10.320 --> 15:15.760
 the informed one, the right one for that pregnant woman, the right one for that unborn child. So

15:15.760 --> 15:20.320
 on clinical update 59, I discussed the New England Journal Medicine article,

15:20.320 --> 15:26.160
 preliminary findings of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine safety in pregnant persons, where the authors

15:26.160 --> 15:35.200
 reported on 35,691 v-safe participants, 16 to 54 years of age identified as pregnant and found

15:35.200 --> 15:43.600
 no safety signals, no fertility issues, no miscarriage issues, etc. So very, very safe. In

15:43.600 --> 15:49.840
 clinical update number 78, we continued this, this thread, and we discussed the article

15:49.840 --> 15:55.680
 characteristics and outcomes of women with COVID-19 giving birth at US academic centers during the

15:55.680 --> 16:02.400
 COVID-19 pandemic. This is the we're moving from safe to are these individuals at higher risk.

16:02.400 --> 16:09.840
 And this was the study that found that pregnant women, pregnant people with COVID-19, were more

16:09.840 --> 16:19.120
 likely to have a preterm birth, right? 16.4% versus 11.5%. So a 5% higher risk of a preterm birth,

16:19.760 --> 16:26.880
 significantly higher rates of ICU admission over five times as likely. The odds of

16:26.880 --> 16:34.880
 requiring mechanical ventilation, intubation, were increased more than 14-fold and a pregnant

16:34.880 --> 16:40.720
 woman admitted to the hospital was 15 times more likely to die. So a pregnant woman who gets

16:40.720 --> 16:47.920
 infected with COVID-19 is at very high risk. And you can imagine that this risk translates into

16:47.920 --> 16:53.360
 bad outcomes for the unborn child, particularly as you can imagine when that pregnant woman

16:53.360 --> 17:00.480
 might die. So we've established safety. We've talked about how this is a high risk population,

17:00.480 --> 17:06.800
 but the safety data continues. The CDC has a special v-safe COVID-19 vaccine

17:07.440 --> 17:12.880
 pregnancy registry website. They update this regularly. It was updated the last on the 14th

17:12.880 --> 17:21.760
 of this month. And as of 913, the day before they updated, 158,465 pregnant women were registered

17:21.760 --> 17:28.080
 in the v-safe after vaccination health checker. And they are reporting there is currently,

17:28.080 --> 17:33.200
 there's still no evidence that any of the vaccines, including COVID-19 vaccines, cause

17:33.200 --> 17:40.320
 fertility or any other problems in this population. On the risk side, unfortunately, though,

17:40.320 --> 17:49.040
 here we have seen over 100,000 pregnant people infected and over 100 of these women have actually

17:49.040 --> 17:54.880
 died of COVID-19. What about taking it a step further? Not only are pregnant women themselves at

17:54.880 --> 18:03.040
 risk, not only are these vaccines safe, but is this a chance to protect two people? What happens

18:03.040 --> 18:08.880
 when that baby is born? And the mother makes that decision to get vaccinated during pregnancy.

18:09.600 --> 18:13.440
 Because a lot of times, and I understand this discussion, I understand the logic,

18:13.440 --> 18:16.800
 I'm going to challenge it, the idea of why don't you just wait until you're done with your

18:16.800 --> 18:21.280
 pregnancy and then get vaccinated. I'm going to discuss here an article where it says,

18:21.280 --> 18:25.920
 please get vaccinated before you have that child to give that child an extra bit of protection.

18:25.920 --> 18:31.760
 So this week, the research letter, high antibody levels in cord blood from pregnant women vaccinated

18:31.760 --> 18:38.320
 against COVID-19 was published in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology. Here,

18:38.320 --> 18:44.480
 as I mentioned in the US, only about 16% of pregnant women have been vaccinated despite this

18:44.480 --> 18:50.400
 really compelling evidence. So here, what they did is they looked at umbilical cord blood.

18:50.400 --> 18:57.040
 This is a way to assess our babies of women vaccinated while pregnant, being born with

18:57.040 --> 19:04.800
 that protection, that high level of spike antibodies. And in this study of umbilical cord blood

19:04.800 --> 19:14.000
 collected from 36 deliveries, 36 neonates, 100% studied were positive for the anti-spike IgG

19:14.560 --> 19:22.560
 at high titers. Among the 36 samples, 31 were also tested for anti-nuclear capsid. These were

19:22.560 --> 19:27.360
 all negative. So these are vaccinated women. These are women that were not infected,

19:27.360 --> 19:32.960
 who because they were vaccinated during pregnancy, were able to pass on that protection to their

19:32.960 --> 19:38.480
 children where we would expect that protection to last at least four months. So if you're pregnant,

19:38.480 --> 19:47.680
 get vaccinated, protects you and your child. Now, what about which vaccine is best? I like that

19:47.680 --> 19:51.680
 now, you know, I've been talking about the t-shirts are going to be on the different teams. I'm on

19:51.680 --> 19:57.440
 team spike backs or Moderna here. And so you might get a little bias here as I discuss this

19:57.440 --> 20:04.800
 comparing comparative effectiveness of Moderna, Pfizer, BioNTech, and Janssen, Johnson and Johnson

20:04.800 --> 20:11.200
 vaccines in preventing COVID-19 hospitalizations among adults without immunocompromising conditions,

20:11.200 --> 20:18.640
 United States, March to August 2021. This came out as an early release in the MMWR,

20:19.360 --> 20:25.840
 actually spoke to Saratoy at the Wall Street Journal about this. And this study was looking at

20:25.840 --> 20:33.040
 vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19 hospitalization. And I feel like whenever you say vaccine

20:33.040 --> 20:38.720
 effectiveness, you have to add against what? This looked at adults aged greater than 18

20:39.680 --> 20:47.040
 or older without an immunocompromised condition, immunocompromising condition admitted to 21

20:47.040 --> 20:54.320
 hospitals within the influenza and other viruses in the acutely ill, the IV network.

20:54.320 --> 21:01.840
 This is a case control prospective analysis. The case patients were admitted to the hospital

21:01.840 --> 21:10.320
 with COVID-19, PCR confirmed or an antigen test. The control patients had a viral illness, but they

21:10.320 --> 21:20.960
 had a negative test. 3,689 patients were included. So we have 1,682 case patients, 2,007 control

21:20.960 --> 21:31.840
 patients. And what did they report? The overall vaccine efficiency, right? And we're talking about

21:31.840 --> 21:42.560
 vaccine efficacy for preventing hospitalization. So overall, 2,362 patients were unvaccinated,

21:42.560 --> 21:49.120
 476 or 12.9 percent were fully vaccinated with one of these vaccines. So remember the numbers

21:49.120 --> 21:58.000
 there. So 476 were fully vaccinated with the Moderna vaccine. 738 were fully vaccinated with the Pfizer

21:58.000 --> 22:05.280
 BioNTech vaccine. And 113 were fully vaccinated with the Janssen vaccine as a one dose.

22:05.280 --> 22:11.120
 The vaccine efficacy against COVID-19 hospitalizations was higher for the Moderna vaccine,

22:11.120 --> 22:19.680
 they're saying 93%. The Pfizer BioNTech, 88%. And then the vaccine efficacy for both vaccines

22:19.680 --> 22:24.720
 was higher than the Janssen. I think there's a couple takeaways from here. If you're on team

22:24.720 --> 22:31.200
 Moderna versus Pfizer, you can claim to have one. Another takeaway is to say that the vaccines

22:31.200 --> 22:37.040
 continued to have very high efficacy over this period of time. And what were those sort of periods

22:37.040 --> 22:44.480
 of time? So Moderna, say 93% for the full surveillance period with 93 in the first 120 days,

22:44.480 --> 22:50.960
 dropping, I'd say dropping to 92, so like dropping from 93 to 92, holding above 90 at

22:50.960 --> 23:00.000
 greater than 120 days. The full surveillance for Pfizer was 88 starting off at 91. And there is

23:00.000 --> 23:08.000
 say a drop to 77. But there's wide confidence intervals here, 67 to 84. And then you look at

23:08.000 --> 23:12.640
 Janssen, and we're going to get to Janssen, Janssen over this period of time in this one study,

23:12.640 --> 23:19.600
 they're reporting 71% over time. So it's interesting that now, you know, and maybe this helps people

23:19.600 --> 23:26.720
 get excited about vaccines and people like to have choices. I think you can take this in several

23:26.720 --> 23:33.840
 ways. But one way you may take it is what about J and J? Maybe J and J is not just one and done.

23:33.840 --> 23:39.920
 So this next section goes out to all the redheads in the audience. This is and by redheads, I mean

23:39.920 --> 23:47.520
 people that got J and J vaccine, because my redheaded son got the Pfizer shots. And I don't know,

23:47.520 --> 23:51.360
 that was an expression that my grandmother, I think I got from my Irish grandmother is the,

23:51.360 --> 23:57.120
 you know, whenever someone was left out, it was, oh, my poor redheaded stepson, right?

23:57.120 --> 24:02.560
 I've got to figure out the history of that expression. But we have a bit about J and J.

24:03.360 --> 24:10.080
 So this starts off with Johnson and Johnson single shot vaccine showed strong and long lasting

24:10.080 --> 24:16.400
 protection in the real world. This is comes out of a preprint effectiveness of the single dose

24:16.400 --> 24:27.120
 at 26 Cove to S COVID vaccine. And what was this data, which is posted as a preprint among 390,000

24:27.120 --> 24:38.000
 507 17 vaccinated and 1.5 24, 153 matched unvaccinated individuals. This is huge, right? About half

24:38.000 --> 24:42.720
 a million compared to one and a half million matched unvaccinated individuals. They're reporting

24:42.720 --> 24:51.520
 here in this preprint, vaccine efficacy was 79% for a recognized COVID-19 infection,

24:51.520 --> 24:59.680
 right? Vaccine efficacy against infection and 81% for a COVID-19 related hospitalization.

24:59.680 --> 25:06.720
 They reported that this was stable over calendar time. And they also looked at states with a high

25:06.720 --> 25:16.640
 delta incidence and saw that this was holding for them as well. So when you grab your numbers,

25:16.640 --> 25:22.240
 I think it's important to see there's points in a line. This looks good. These data were

25:22.240 --> 25:28.640
 consistent with the phase three ensemble trial, where they were shown that those strong protection

25:28.640 --> 25:37.280
 against severe critical disease. But what about boosters? Maybe J&J is not the one and done.

25:37.280 --> 25:42.240
 Maybe J&J is the two and done. So what about a booster shot for folks with J&J?

25:43.360 --> 25:51.760
 So here, the announcement, and at this point, this is press release level from J&J booster shot at

25:51.760 --> 26:01.280
 two months. They report provided 94% protection against COVID-19 in the U.S. And this is the phase

26:01.280 --> 26:09.360
 three ensemble to study, looking at getting another shot of the Johnson and Johnson COVID-19 vaccine

26:09.360 --> 26:16.000
 56 days after the first. And so they say, and actually I have to say someone asked me this at work,

26:16.000 --> 26:22.320
 they say 100% protection. The confidence interval is 33 to 100. So that's a wide confidence interval

26:22.320 --> 26:29.920
 against severe critical COVID-19, at least 14 days post-final vaccination. 75% protection

26:29.920 --> 26:36.560
 against symptomatic moderate to severe COVID-19. This is looking at a global data set,

26:36.560 --> 26:45.520
 but confidence intervals 55 to 87, 94% protection against symptomatic moderate to severe COVID-19

26:45.520 --> 26:51.520
 in the U.S. And again, wide confidence intervals 58 to 100. And then they throw a second little bit

26:51.520 --> 27:00.880
 of data when a booster was given at six months. So booster shot at six months provided 12-fold

27:00.880 --> 27:06.640
 increase in antibodies. Here, they're reporting that a booster of J&J, given six months after

27:06.640 --> 27:13.920
 the single shot, compared to that second, that two months afterwards, gives you this extra 12-fold

27:13.920 --> 27:20.000
 increase in antibodies. These rises were irrespective of age. So we're getting a little more information.

27:20.000 --> 27:26.480
 I know people feel like, Oh my gosh, I got the J&J. How come nobody's talking about me? How come?

27:26.480 --> 27:31.680
 And it's over 10 million people got J&J here in the U.S. alone. So we're getting more data,

27:31.680 --> 27:37.280
 and I would not be surprised if the J&J becomes the two shots and you're done instead of the one

27:37.280 --> 27:44.240
 and you're done. Vincent, any thoughts on all that data? So last week, we did a paper which

27:45.520 --> 27:53.600
 showed lower efficacy for J&J and Rich Condits said, I bet a boost is what J&J needs. There you go.

27:54.240 --> 27:58.640
 Yeah. All right. Well, he may be right. Yeah, it is interesting. And J&J is a tough vaccine

27:58.640 --> 28:03.760
 when you look at antibody levels, because if you compare the antibody levels elicited by the

28:03.760 --> 28:10.160
 mRNA vaccines and the J&J vaccines, it's actually two different worlds. I think you're ending up with

28:10.160 --> 28:13.760
 geometric means in the thousands for Moderna and Pfizer. You're ending up with geometric

28:13.760 --> 28:19.120
 mean of less than 100 for J&J. But somehow J&J works. So we're thinking there may be

28:20.480 --> 28:26.240
 a different cellular aspect to the protection given from J&J, which again comes back to the

28:26.240 --> 28:31.840
 issue as people talk about boosters. If someone, if there is, turns out there's waiting immunity

28:31.840 --> 28:38.560
 with the Pfizer vaccine, should that third dose be Pfizer? Should it be J&J? Should it be Moderna?

28:39.520 --> 28:43.680
 I don't see that data quickly coming because Pfizer is going to study Pfizer. Moderna is going to

28:43.680 --> 28:48.720
 study Moderna. J&J is going to study J&J. There will only be small bits of information about

28:48.720 --> 28:55.440
 heterologous or mix and match out there. All right. Passive vaccination. The theme today is,

28:55.440 --> 29:02.720
 everyone seems to have found out monoclonal are really in demand. Here we're talking about passive

29:02.720 --> 29:11.200
 vaccination. So pre-exposure. So this or I guess pre-positive viral test. So post-exposure prophylaxis.

29:11.200 --> 29:17.840
 And the EUA, the emergency use authorization, was expanded for Eli Lilly's cocktail, the BAM

29:17.840 --> 29:25.280
 line of the map, a test of the map. And now that has an EUA expansion to include post-exposure prophylaxis.

29:26.240 --> 29:32.160
 People probably need to know a little bit about what I'm talking about here. So these neutralizing

29:32.160 --> 29:38.720
 antibodies can be used as a cocktail to treat high-risk individuals 12 years of age and older

29:38.720 --> 29:44.560
 who have either not been fully vaccinated or are not expected to mount an adequate immune

29:44.560 --> 29:50.640
 response to complete vaccination and have been exposed to someone infected with SARS-CoV-2

29:51.520 --> 29:56.640
 or who are at high risk of exposure in an institutional setting such as the nursing home or

29:56.640 --> 30:03.440
 prison. And we talked about how Regeneron Cove also has this indication. So this is that taking

30:03.440 --> 30:08.640
 that history. Okay, you're here. You're testing positive. Maybe you're here to get your monoclonals.

30:08.640 --> 30:15.920
 But you have that 78-year-old husband at home with COPD and diabetes and maybe a little more

30:15.920 --> 30:20.160
 weight than they should have. They can come in. If the test is positive, you treat them.

30:20.160 --> 30:25.760
 If the test is negative and they're having this exposure, you also treat them. And really excellent

30:25.760 --> 30:31.360
 data supporting this. But people may be asking, I thought we weren't doing Eli Lilly cocktails

30:31.360 --> 30:38.480
 anymore. I thought that they stopped using these with that beta variant, with that E484K, Dr. Griffith.

30:38.480 --> 30:45.920
 I don't know how many people are thinking that. But anyway, the nice thing about the delta variant

30:45.920 --> 30:51.600
 is that when they have looked at this and they actually have data now in the EUA,

30:51.600 --> 30:56.800
 authentic SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing data for bamelinibimab and a test of mab together,

30:57.680 --> 31:04.720
 there is no change in the fold reduction in susceptibility with beta. It was greater than

31:04.720 --> 31:11.520
 325. So this cocktail does not work against beta. It does work against delta. But do we

31:11.520 --> 31:16.960
 have now enough data to go ahead and start using this widely as post-exposure prophylaxis?

31:16.960 --> 31:23.600
 This is the Ugg moment, as people now know. Now that everyone is excited about monoclonals,

31:23.600 --> 31:31.840
 now that we have over 100,000 new cases a day, we've actually started rationing monoclonals

31:31.840 --> 31:38.720
 around the country. And there's actually a website, the phe.gov, where you can look and you can

31:38.720 --> 31:44.480
 actually see how many doses is my state going to get for a particular week. We're only getting

31:44.480 --> 31:51.600
 about 5,000 doses for all of New York State each week. So really not enough to meet the demand

31:51.600 --> 31:57.920
 for everyone who can potentially benefit from this. All right, the period of detectable viral

31:57.920 --> 32:02.960
 replication, that viral symptom phase, as I've been saying for a while, the time for monitoring

32:02.960 --> 32:09.120
 and monoclonals, not the time for antibiotics, not the time for steroids. We can do harm with

32:09.120 --> 32:14.800
 steroids. We can do harm and are not being helpful. We give people antibiotics here.

32:16.080 --> 32:20.080
 But we did get what I thought was an interesting press release from Gilett.

32:20.080 --> 32:27.920
 And this was Veklori. Anyone know what that is? Remdesivir. I'm going to replace Remdesivir

32:27.920 --> 32:33.360
 in this press release. Remdesivir significantly reduced risk of hospitalization in high-risk

32:33.360 --> 32:40.480
 patients with COVID-19. This data is going to be presented in detail at ID Week, which starts next

32:40.480 --> 32:46.480
 week. I'm going to be doing a presentation. This data is from a Phase 3 randomized double-blind

32:46.480 --> 32:53.600
 placebo control trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a three-day course of Remdesivir

32:54.400 --> 32:59.600
 for intravenous use for the treatment of COVID-19 in non-hospitalized patients

32:59.600 --> 33:06.080
 at high risk for disease progression. So this is, let's give Remdesivir, not during that second

33:06.080 --> 33:12.080
 week when they're being admitted for an early inflammatory process, let's give it in that first

33:12.080 --> 33:19.840
 week during the viral phase. And in an analysis of 562 participants randomly assigned any one-to-one

33:19.840 --> 33:26.800
 ratio to receive Remdesivir or placebo, Remdesivir demonstrated a statistically significant

33:26.800 --> 33:35.040
 87% reduction in risk for the composite primary endpoint of related hospitalization or all-caused

33:35.040 --> 33:39.280
 death. There were no deaths. So this is really, you know, I'm going to sort of say this is

33:39.280 --> 33:46.880
 going on to end up in the hospital. So the results show this 81% reduction for the

33:46.880 --> 33:52.320
 composite secondary endpoint of medical visits at all, or all-caused mortality, but again,

33:52.320 --> 33:59.440
 there's no mortality in this study. So 87% reduction, 81% reduction, great p-values,

33:59.440 --> 34:09.440
 p-0.008, p-0.002. Remdesivir early on during those first few days of illness is starting to look

34:09.440 --> 34:15.680
 like the monoclonal, starting to look like an efficacious intervention. The challenge, of course,

34:15.680 --> 34:21.120
 is this isn't just you come in and get that one monoclonal infusion. This is a three day. So

34:21.120 --> 34:28.240
 you got to come day one, day two, day three. So there's going to be a whole issue with operationalizing

34:28.240 --> 34:35.360
 this. Also, the issue is will the EUA expand? And we are hearing that on the horizon, there may be

34:35.360 --> 34:42.960
 oral drugs that may make this much easier to actually provide effective oral antivirals.

34:44.240 --> 34:48.800
 All right. What if you wait to let early inflammatory phase when people get hospitalized,

34:48.800 --> 34:53.600
 and then you decide to give them remdesivir? I think I've related over time. I've been less

34:53.600 --> 35:00.000
 than impressed. And there was another publication in the Lancet Infectious Diseases,

35:00.000 --> 35:04.960
 remdesivir plus standard of care versus standard of care alone for the treatment of patients

35:04.960 --> 35:12.160
 admitted to hospital with COVID-19. So this is the DISC COVERIG study, that's sort of a catchy

35:13.200 --> 35:20.960
 title there. This is a phase three randomized controlled open label trial. It's adaptive

35:20.960 --> 35:26.960
 multi-center. It was conducted in 48 sites in Europe. So France, Belgium, Austria, Portugal,

35:26.960 --> 35:33.120
 Luxembourg. And there were a number of different agents that were in this trial. So it's a one

35:33.120 --> 35:40.000
 to one to one to one to one to receive different agents. One of those was the remdesivir.

35:40.800 --> 35:46.080
 So let's just talk about the remdesivir versus control data. No significant difference in the

35:46.080 --> 35:54.320
 occurrence of serious adverse events between treatment groups. There were no noted benefit.

35:55.040 --> 36:00.320
 There were three deaths that were considered related to remdesivir by the investigators,

36:00.880 --> 36:07.600
 but only one by the sponsors safety team that was a paddle renal syndrome. So really not showing

36:07.600 --> 36:14.080
 any significant difference here. So we will probably be moving on hopefully to more exciting

36:14.080 --> 36:19.920
 agents in the coming weeks. But what about anticoagulation? This is when people end up in the

36:19.920 --> 36:26.400
 hospital. We start the steroids only in individuals in that second week who have oxygen saturations

36:26.400 --> 36:34.480
 less than 94. We often give remdesivir, but anticoagulation, what dose? So I thought this was a

36:34.480 --> 36:38.400
 good paper. I'm actually going to tell people to spend a little time looking at this, particularly

36:38.400 --> 36:44.400
 if you're treating patients, safety and efficacy of different prophylactic anticoagulation dosing

36:44.400 --> 36:50.800
 regimens in critically and non-critically ill patients with COVID-19, a systematic review and

36:50.800 --> 36:55.920
 men analysis of randomized control trials. This was published in the European Heart Journal,

36:55.920 --> 37:01.360
 cardiovascular pharmacology, and the authors searched for randomized control trials,

37:01.360 --> 37:06.160
 comparing treatment with an escalated dose, so an intermediate or therapeutic dose,

37:06.160 --> 37:11.440
 versus a standard prophylactic dose, looking at critically and non-critically ill COVID

37:11.440 --> 37:16.720
 patients that required hospitalization. And these are individuals who weren't on anticoagulation

37:16.720 --> 37:23.520
 for some other reasons, specifically COVID-related. The primary efficacy endpoint was all caused

37:23.520 --> 37:29.760
 death, and the primary safety endpoint was major bleeding. Seven randomized control trials were

37:29.760 --> 37:38.880
 identified. This included 5,154 patients followed for an average of 33 days, and we're comparing

37:38.880 --> 37:46.240
 standard dose prophylactic anticoagulation versus this escalated dose anticoagulation.

37:47.360 --> 37:52.800
 And this was not associated with a reduction in all-cause mortality, so when you escalate it

37:52.800 --> 37:59.920
 to a higher dose, we're talking 17.8 versus 18.6, so you're not getting an extra benefit, but there was

38:00.640 --> 38:09.040
 an associated increase in major bleeding up to 2.4 percent from 1.4, so a relative risk of 1.73,

38:09.760 --> 38:20.000
 and that was confidence intervals 1.15 to 2.60. So we do know that if you use higher dose anticoagulation,

38:20.000 --> 38:26.720
 you will have less clots, but you will also have more bleeds, and overall, you're not getting a

38:26.720 --> 38:34.800
 statistically significant mortality benefit to doing that. So current recommendations are still

38:34.800 --> 38:41.040
 prophylactic dosing across the board, but what's nice about this paper is you can actually look

38:41.040 --> 38:45.360
 through. You can look at the different studies. Again, we're at a point now when I don't think

38:45.360 --> 38:50.000
 people should be just grabbing one study, even if it's published in the England Journal, you need to

38:50.000 --> 38:54.160
 look at all the studies when you're trying to come up, and when I sit on the American side of

38:54.160 --> 39:00.160
 hematology guideline panel, we are looking through dozens, hundreds of studies at this point trying

39:00.160 --> 39:05.840
 to really come up with what does the science tell us. The science, unfortunately, is still low

39:05.840 --> 39:12.320
 quality, I will say, and if you look through this study, you're going to see that one of the outliers

39:12.320 --> 39:21.280
 is actually the REMCAP active for a TTACC paper. And what you have to do is that was a pretty large

39:21.280 --> 39:29.440
 number of individuals, 2,219, so as the potential to shift biases. But I will suggest people spend

39:29.440 --> 39:34.880
 a little bit of time reading this, try to get some context on what we know and the decisions

39:34.880 --> 39:40.720
 to be made about what level of anticoagulation. But I think it just reinforces, you know,

39:40.720 --> 39:46.800
 an individualized assessment of the patient's risk of thrombosis, and bleeding is important

39:46.800 --> 39:53.600
 when deciding on anticoagulation intensity. All right, and I'm going to sort of wrap it up here

39:53.600 --> 39:59.040
 with what I think is a little bit of good news. No one is safe until everyone is safe. This week,

39:59.040 --> 40:04.960
 the UN is in town here in New York, and we are hearing about a commitment to vaccinate the world.

40:04.960 --> 40:12.480
 It was announced Wednesday, September 21, 21, that the United States is doubling its purchase

40:12.480 --> 40:18.800
 of Pfizer COVID-19 shots to share with the world, increasing this up to 1 billion doses,

40:19.520 --> 40:26.560
 and there is a goal of vaccinating at least 70% of the global population within the next year.

40:26.560 --> 40:30.480
 So on that note, I'll remind everyone through the months of August, September, October,

40:30.480 --> 40:36.240
 donations made to parasites without borders will support floating doctors and all the great work

40:36.240 --> 40:42.080
 they do down in Panama. So go to parasites without borders.com, click donate and help us and help

40:42.080 --> 40:50.320
 us support them. Time for some email questions for Daniel. You can send yours to Daniel at microbe.tv.

40:50.320 --> 40:54.960
 Jody writes, my cousin, a health care worker in Michigan, who was pregnant in her third trimester,

40:54.960 --> 41:01.520
 wrote to ask for thoughts on whether to get a third shot of Pfizer. Her OB is all for it,

41:01.520 --> 41:06.720
 but she was curious to know whether or not I had encountered any discussion or studies on the matter.

41:06.720 --> 41:12.720
 I understand that pregnancy is an immunocompromised state and that pregnant women are at increased

41:12.720 --> 41:17.840
 risk of developing severe symptoms. But I also remember learning that fever during a pregnancy

41:17.840 --> 41:23.280
 can be harmful to the developing baby, and she could experience fever as a side effect after

41:23.280 --> 41:28.880
 receiving the shot. Can you shed any light on this issue for us? Yeah, no, this is this is a great

41:28.880 --> 41:33.520
 question. And and I think that, you know, one of the things about the meeting that was had on

41:33.520 --> 41:39.520
 Friday and the decision was made this week, is they're not saying don't give boosters. Pfizer

41:39.520 --> 41:44.080
 is a licensed vaccine. They're saying have this discussion with your provider. And so I'm going

41:44.080 --> 41:49.760
 to encourage this individual to do that. So I'm going to speak more broadly on this topic. First

41:49.760 --> 41:55.200
 off, kudos, you're in the 16% of pregnant women that have already gotten your two doses. I think

41:55.200 --> 42:01.200
 that's fantastic. And that really, you know, the data would really say that that's the wise decision

42:01.200 --> 42:07.600
 for her and her baby. But the third dose, you know, one of the big things that came out in the studies

42:08.160 --> 42:13.600
 that were discussed last Friday was that individuals under the age of 40 under the age of 50 really

42:13.600 --> 42:19.360
 continued to have really excellent protection. There's no compelling data that everyone across

42:19.360 --> 42:24.160
 the board needs that third dose. We certainly have no compelling data that that third dose

42:24.160 --> 42:29.360
 needs to be given across the board to pregnant women. So as a general, I will say the science

42:29.360 --> 42:35.120
 does not necessarily push one to go forward with that third dose during pregnancy. And this would

42:35.120 --> 42:39.600
 be one of those issues. We really are careful with vaccines. We really want to know the safety

42:39.600 --> 42:44.720
 profile before we encourage people to do that. And right now we have great safety data on the

42:44.720 --> 42:52.160
 two shots in pregnancy. We don't have the safety data on giving another dose. So have that conversation

42:52.160 --> 42:57.840
 with the physician get all the facts make an informed decision. Marcy writes question about masks.

42:57.840 --> 43:03.120
 Have you seen the singing masks? And what do you think of them for singing in a choir? All vaccinated,

43:03.120 --> 43:09.440
 standing six feet apart in a very large open room, a church outdoors for part of rehearsal.

43:09.440 --> 43:17.120
 Would face shields add anything? So I have not I am not familiar with the singing

43:17.120 --> 43:23.200
 the singing mask. That said, are you familiar with the singing mask? No, I'm not familiar with that.

43:23.200 --> 43:27.440
 But no, I mean, this is this is a creative it sounds very creative. I don't know what the data

43:27.440 --> 43:33.760
 is on it, but it'd be interesting to see because yeah, people want to do the activities that they

43:33.760 --> 43:38.320
 enjoy. Sometimes the singing is just singing because they love singing. I think there's some

43:38.320 --> 43:44.960
 singers on in the Twiv co-hosts. There's also some people that enjoy playing instruments. I'm a

43:44.960 --> 43:48.640
 flute player, by the way, because people didn't know that. So I'm trying to figure out how I can

43:48.640 --> 43:52.640
 play a flute if I have to convert over to something made out of silver or copper. I don't have enough

43:52.640 --> 43:58.480
 money to buy a silver flute. But so no, this sounds great and interesting. I'll have to look

43:58.480 --> 44:04.560
 into that. Yeah, they look like masks with an extended front, right, with some kind of structure

44:04.560 --> 44:09.920
 instead of sitting up against your face. So take a look. Yeah, it might make sense.

44:09.920 --> 44:14.880
 Mike writes, trying to convince my 23 year old daughter to get vaccinated. She's hesitant.

44:15.440 --> 44:19.280
 I think this is common in her age group. Not sure I can change your mind. I'm trying to point to

44:19.280 --> 44:25.040
 some credible large scale data showing the efficacy, which I define as reduction in hospitalization,

44:25.040 --> 44:31.920
 long COVID and death. The vaccines are all presented as having impressive 90% efficacy numbers.

44:31.920 --> 44:37.120
 I tried to read the paper you mentioned in number 800, risk factors and disease profile of post

44:37.120 --> 44:45.040
 vaccination infection in UK users of the COVID symptom study app. They reported 0.5% of the one

44:45.040 --> 44:50.560
 dose vaccinated subsequently caught COVID 0.2% of the two dose. But I did not see the number

44:50.560 --> 44:56.160
 of unvaccinated people in these data. Surely the number of cases in the UK unvaccinated population

44:56.160 --> 45:03.920
 is known over the same period. Yeah, so this is I think a really important conversation that

45:03.920 --> 45:09.280
 you're having. So keep having that conversation. The first thing to do is ask your daughter,

45:09.280 --> 45:14.880
 listen, find out what's going on. I've had several conversations and people always apologize.

45:14.880 --> 45:18.720
 I'm sorry, Dr. Griffin. I have a question. I know you're so busy. I'm never too busy to talk

45:18.720 --> 45:25.520
 about vaccines. What are the risks? What are people worried about in their early 20s? I was

45:25.520 --> 45:31.680
 talking to one of our case managers today who has a 25 24 year old daughter. It's a very close

45:31.680 --> 45:39.360
 2324. Sometimes actually telling stories that have been shared with you or that you've talked

45:39.360 --> 45:45.920
 to the person individually. And the story was here. Her 24 year old daughter got COVID and is still

45:45.920 --> 45:50.880
 continuing to have this chest pain that wakes her up from night. We have individuals who have

45:50.880 --> 45:56.080
 loss of smell. We have individuals when they lose their hair, we have individuals with long

45:56.080 --> 46:02.480
 COVID and all those issues. Most people in their 20s are in their heads immortal. So they're not

46:02.480 --> 46:08.800
 going to die. So the risk of death to them is not particularly persuasive. Ending up in the hospital

46:08.800 --> 46:14.560
 is not really part of their worldview. But a lot of the other things we've learned about COVID

46:14.560 --> 46:20.960
 is this young group, particularly, it looks like women more than men are at higher risk of a

46:20.960 --> 46:28.080
 post acute sequelae of COVID lingering long term issues. Teeth have fallen out, hairs fallen out,

46:28.080 --> 46:33.920
 fatigue, low energy, cognitive dysfunction, which we're now calling it instead of brain fog to

46:33.920 --> 46:39.360
 recognize just how profound that can be the inability to exercise at the level where they could be

46:39.360 --> 46:44.080
 for. So I think it's important to share and talk about these. How long will those things last to

46:44.080 --> 46:48.800
 be completely honest? We only have about two years of data. So you could throw that in there,

46:48.800 --> 46:55.040
 you may only feel crummy for one or two years, where we know the safety profile of the vaccines,

46:55.040 --> 47:00.480
 incredibly safe, much lower risk of having any problem by getting vaccinated compared to all

47:00.480 --> 47:07.520
 we've learned about this horrible virus. Robert writes, Dr. Griffin says he likes to emphasize

47:07.520 --> 47:12.480
 to people that COVID is not a two week disease. The situation is more complicated than just getting

47:12.480 --> 47:17.520
 COVID being sick for a couple of weeks and then getting better or not. If this is in fact the case,

47:17.520 --> 47:23.680
 why is it that long COVID seems to be understood by the medical community as a sequelae to COVID-19?

47:23.680 --> 47:29.600
 I think Dr. Griffin calls it a subset of packs rather than part of the acute disease process.

47:29.600 --> 47:35.680
 Is the distinction meaningful or just semantic? Also, we've only had slightly less than two years

47:35.680 --> 47:43.120
 experienced. This doesn't sound long to me, but then I'm 73. Yes, one day in my 70s, I will have

47:43.120 --> 47:49.680
 that wisdom and patience that it sounds like you have developed. Yeah, we only have a certain

47:49.680 --> 47:55.200
 period of time. So what are we talking about? And so when the NIH got together and they tried

47:55.200 --> 48:01.520
 to defy what was going on, they came up with this term P-A-S-C or past post-acute sequelae of

48:01.520 --> 48:08.880
 COVID. And what they were realizing and a colleague of mine, Sarah Dottie, published a paper with

48:08.880 --> 48:15.120
 Ken Cohen and some others at UnitedHealth Group looking at individuals that got COVID. What happened

48:15.120 --> 48:21.840
 to them over the next year? And we were seeing twice the incidence of new diagnosis of diabetes,

48:22.400 --> 48:27.040
 fivefold increase risk of stroke, things like that. So we started to realize that there were a

48:27.040 --> 48:32.560
 lot of sequelae, a lot of things that were happening to these individuals after COVID infection that

48:32.560 --> 48:37.200
 weren't just what we're being described in these support groups. So it's sort of larger umbrella

48:37.200 --> 48:42.880
 to understand what's going on. As a subset, we have individuals with this syndrome where they

48:42.880 --> 48:48.240
 have fatigue, where they have cognitive dysfunction, where they have a chest pain, where they have

48:48.960 --> 48:52.560
 headaches, nuanced headaches that they've never had before, a number of these other things that

48:52.560 --> 48:57.840
 we sort of put together. And what we basically, it is meaningful for us as clinicians, but I think

48:57.840 --> 49:03.680
 it's also meaningful for us living in this society, that there are individuals at four weeks who are

49:03.680 --> 49:08.000
 not better. There's individuals that eight weeks who are not better. We now have individuals who

49:08.000 --> 49:14.640
 got sick in March of 2020, who still are not well enough to return to their pre-illness

49:14.640 --> 49:20.000
 employment. And a lot of our large employers are telling us that's still about 10% of their

49:20.000 --> 49:26.800
 workforce. So I think this is really important. And I think it is meaningful. Will, at some point,

49:26.800 --> 49:31.360
 these people get better. Some of them are getting better. That's true. By the time you get about

49:31.360 --> 49:38.160
 one year out, a significant percent of these people have either improved or gotten better.

49:38.160 --> 49:43.040
 But unfortunately, there's a residual, a fairly large residual, that have continued to suffer

49:43.040 --> 49:50.960
 even 12 months, 18 months out. So Robert points out that I said on a recent podcast that there's

49:50.960 --> 49:57.440
 no long polio, but he says there is post polio, where years after recovering from polio and

49:57.440 --> 50:04.000
 regaining limb function, you start to lose it again. And so he points out that is what I think of as

50:04.000 --> 50:10.960
 a sequelae, right? It happens. But it's not really long polio because you don't have a continuous

50:10.960 --> 50:16.000
 set of symptoms as you do with with COVID. I mean, I know it's a distinction, but I think it's

50:16.000 --> 50:19.920
 actually clinically different, don't you think? Yeah. And I think that's an important distinction

50:20.560 --> 50:26.880
 that you make. And I was not that familiar in my training with post polio syndrome until I went

50:26.880 --> 50:32.640
 out to Colorado. And I was working in an area that had been really hard hit with polio. And so I

50:32.640 --> 50:38.160
 was taking care of a lot of individuals who were in their 50s, 60s, and older, who were on walkers

50:38.160 --> 50:42.000
 who basically said they had polio when they were younger, they thought they'd made a complete

50:42.000 --> 50:48.240
 recovery. But then when they got into their 50s, they had apparently lost enough reserve that they

50:48.240 --> 50:53.440
 needed a walker, which I'm in my 50s. And so if I was needing a walker in my 50s, I would be

50:53.440 --> 50:58.400
 quite shocked. So that is one of the things we worry about long term, what's going to happen?

50:58.400 --> 51:04.800
 We know with COVID now, months 18 months out, what's going to happen two, three, five years.

51:04.800 --> 51:10.640
 I do not expect it to be anything like the horrors of the post polio syndrome that we saw.

51:10.640 --> 51:12.960
 But boy, there are plenty of horrors that we're seeing now.

51:13.920 --> 51:18.800
 For any viral disease, you can often think of long term consequences. For example,

51:19.600 --> 51:28.080
 West Nile neurological infection, you have cognitive and motor problems. Even mumps can have long

51:28.080 --> 51:36.560
 term. In some boys, it would sterilize them. But it's not a continuous spectrum. Long COVID,

51:36.560 --> 51:39.040
 I think is different, because as you say, it just doesn't stop.

51:40.400 --> 51:48.320
 I would agree. That is COVID-19 clinical update number 81 with Dr. Daniel Griffin. Thank you, Daniel.

51:48.320 --> 51:59.360
 Oh, thank you, and everyone be safe.
