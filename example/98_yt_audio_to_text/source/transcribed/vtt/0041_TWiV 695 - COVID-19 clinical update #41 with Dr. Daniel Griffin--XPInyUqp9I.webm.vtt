 This week in virology, the podcast about viruses, the kind that make you sick.

00:10.240 --> 00:21.280
 From Microbe TV, this is Twiv, this week in virology. Episode 695, recorded on December 17, 2020.

00:21.920 --> 00:26.560
 I'm Vincent Rack and Yellow, and you're listening to the podcast All About Viruses.

00:26.560 --> 00:32.800
 Joining me today from New York, Daniel Griffin. Hello, everyone.

00:33.760 --> 00:39.920
 Historic Week, Daniel. It is actually, and this time the voting was a little bit quicker,

00:39.920 --> 00:45.520
 but I'll get to that. But yeah, let's start because I've got a lot to say,

00:45.520 --> 00:51.200
 and we want to keep this under 30 minutes for all the busy folks that want a quick update.

00:51.200 --> 01:00.560
 So my quotation, at this historic moment, Shirley, not one of us is too busy, too young, or too old to play a part.

01:01.440 --> 01:06.880
 And that was actually King George VI, the father of Elizabeth II.

01:07.920 --> 01:14.080
 And he was actually speaking about D-Day. And I think this is appropriate, right? We are now

01:14.080 --> 01:20.000
 launching massive vaccination campaigns. And this is going to take a lot of effort,

01:20.000 --> 01:24.400
 a lot of coordination, and a lot of people are going to need to be involved to make sure that

01:24.400 --> 01:31.520
 this actually goes from manufacturing to actually people's arms. So start a little bit with some

01:31.520 --> 01:39.920
 patient updates. I think everyone realizes that the projected post-Thanksgiving rise is what we're

01:39.920 --> 01:46.880
 seeing. We're setting records, numbers of people who are getting sick, numbers of people who are

01:46.880 --> 01:56.800
 dying per day. It's quickly approaching 4,000. It's well over 3500. And I'm not in the best of

01:56.800 --> 02:02.880
 moods when my patients die. And I had earlier this week, gentlemen, no medical problems in his

02:02.880 --> 02:10.080
 30s who died, just had another gentleman died today. I have a teenager in the ICU who I don't

02:10.080 --> 02:17.200
 think she's going to make it. So this is a horrible disease. Each one of these people who dies is

02:17.200 --> 02:24.480
 someone that people love, that people care about. The vaccine is here. I just heard about an ICU

02:24.480 --> 02:30.080
 nurse who just got diagnosed today. And I mean, the vaccines are here. So I know it's Christmas.

02:30.080 --> 02:35.280
 I know everyone's hoping to get together. But I'm going to be the Grinch, right? And I'm going to

02:35.280 --> 02:40.000
 say please, you know, postpone Christmas. Can we do that? I just want people to be safe.

02:41.120 --> 02:44.800
 Yeah. I mean, I try not to be judgy, but when I see this many people dying and you know,

02:44.800 --> 02:49.120
 I see families, they got together. They were doing nothing wrong. This is not a moral issue.

02:49.120 --> 02:54.720
 This is just, it's really dangerous. So all right, let's go to the pre-exposure period.

02:55.680 --> 03:00.880
 And I always like to touch on testing and a little shout out here to Rachel, the special

03:00.880 --> 03:07.840
 assistant to the NH director of COVID-19 Diagnostics. She let me know that they appreciate the updates,

03:08.560 --> 03:13.200
 you know, because for them, it's nice to get some feedback what's happening on the ground. So

03:13.200 --> 03:18.560
 happy to hear that. And I'm going to give some feedbacks here and feedback. Yeah, no plural on

03:18.560 --> 03:27.840
 that. Just feedback. This is an update, the FDA updated its FAQs on testing. And I was communicating

03:27.840 --> 03:33.920
 a little with one of the New York Times reporters who may drop a story on this, but I told her that

03:33.920 --> 03:40.400
 she has until Saturday morning when this episode drops. But actually, the FDA basically went ahead

03:40.400 --> 03:46.800
 and said, okay, these tests are not approved. These PCR tests are not approved for quantitative,

03:46.800 --> 03:52.800
 saying the quantity of virus. But go ahead, you can share those CT values with clinicians.

03:52.800 --> 03:58.720
 And there's a bunch of caveats in there. But for me, as a practicing clinician, this is exciting.

03:59.280 --> 04:04.400
 This is a helpful update. And there's a number of qualifications. And I think those qualifications

04:04.400 --> 04:10.240
 are appropriate. So what are the things that sort of gives some background here? We use a

04:10.240 --> 04:16.240
 measurement of the amount of virus of the viral load, so to speak. We look at these cycle threshold

04:16.240 --> 04:23.520
 values when we manage a number of viral diseases. So CMB, cytomegalovirus, we use it for HIV, the

04:23.520 --> 04:28.880
 virus that causes AIDS, we use it for hepatitis. And we're used to some degree of variability.

04:29.600 --> 04:33.520
 We're actually careful to say, like, oh, are these, we're treading something over time,

04:33.520 --> 04:37.200
 is that being done in the same lab, because there can be some interlab variability.

04:38.880 --> 04:44.880
 But there's also an extra bit of variability here, right? We're used to doing blood tests,

04:44.880 --> 04:48.640
 and someone draws a certain amount of blood, and a certain amount of blood is then put on the

04:48.640 --> 04:53.680
 machine. But here, we're actually doing swabs. And those swabs could be taken from different

04:53.680 --> 04:58.320
 sites. It could be one of those deep brain biopsy swabs, where it's really pushed in there,

04:58.320 --> 05:03.600
 and it's twirled around, sort of a blind procedure. And it could be left in there for a proper,

05:03.600 --> 05:08.400
 you know, 15 seconds, appropriate number of twists, where it could be sort of in and back out.

05:08.400 --> 05:14.800
 It could be taken from the front, sort of just inside the nose, 15 seconds each side,

05:14.800 --> 05:20.400
 making sure you get a good sample, or not, right? It's operator-dependent. It could be actually a

05:20.400 --> 05:26.400
 swab from the mouth, or even the back of the throat. So the collection can actually affect

05:26.400 --> 05:31.040
 these things. And we know a few things. We know that you tend to get the highest amount of virus,

05:31.040 --> 05:37.120
 if you swab deep in that middle-terminate swab, the NP swab that we started with. If you do the

05:37.120 --> 05:42.640
 front of the nose, it comes up about three cycles later, right? So about a 10-fold difference.

05:43.520 --> 05:48.880
 If you do it in the mouth, it's actually about 10 cycles different. So, you know, there's a lot

05:48.880 --> 05:54.080
 of caveats, and we're going to have to do a little bit here to make sure we interpret that. But at

05:54.080 --> 05:59.920
 the ends of the spectrum, I think we can make sense of this. You know, if you get the report

05:59.920 --> 06:07.520
 that that CT value is less than 24, that you're translating that into millions of RNA copy numbers,

06:08.240 --> 06:12.240
 you're probably dealing with someone in that height of infection. You're probably dealing

06:12.240 --> 06:17.680
 with someone who's very infectious. This is someone rush home. Don't pass go. Don't go get

06:17.680 --> 06:23.200
 those groceries. You can order them. And at the other end of the spectrum, let's say it comes up

06:23.200 --> 06:30.640
 37, 38, so past 36. And then we want to ask a few more questions. Was it collected properly?

06:30.640 --> 06:36.800
 Where was it from? Because here we want to calculate, is this, you know, due to poor sample procurement,

06:36.800 --> 06:41.520
 or is it actually really that they're kind of either the tail end of illness or right in the

06:41.520 --> 06:47.360
 beginning? So, you know, the ends of the spectrum, I think we can really work with this. You know,

06:47.360 --> 06:50.800
 there's going to be gray areas in the middle. It comes up at about 30. That might be a little

06:50.800 --> 06:57.040
 harder to interpret. But for us as clinicians, this is helpful. I had a case, well, I have a case,

06:57.040 --> 07:01.680
 gentleman, a gentleman from Nigeria, right? One of the few people who actually appreciates

07:01.680 --> 07:05.520
 that I own cows, right? So I showed him a couple of cows, and then he wanted to know how many

07:05.520 --> 07:14.000
 wives I had so. And he had actually been sick really for several weeks, right? Two plus weeks.

07:14.000 --> 07:18.400
 And, you know, first he tried azithromycin, and then he tried bactrum, and then he wasn't

07:18.400 --> 07:23.920
 getting better and ended up in the hospital. And, you know, his first test was negative. But it

07:23.920 --> 07:28.720
 just didn't seem right. It really seemed like this was a viral syndrome. We tested again. This

07:28.720 --> 07:33.520
 time it was positive. So my suspicion, right, is that it's right sort of on the edge here of

07:33.520 --> 07:38.320
 detection probably high 30. So, you know, being able to get a CT value in a context like that,

07:38.320 --> 07:41.520
 that's actually helpful. So, oh, and by the way, just one wife.

07:41.520 --> 07:49.360
 The CT values are going to be available for all nucleic acid tests. So not, and this is actually

07:49.360 --> 07:54.480
 an excellent question, Vincent, not all the machines actually allow you to get those values.

07:55.120 --> 08:00.560
 It's actually cheaper to buy a machine that just gives you a yes or no, basically just at the end

08:00.560 --> 08:05.760
 of, we'll say 40 cycles says yes or no. The more sophisticated machines, right? Apparently,

08:05.760 --> 08:11.360
 the ones that the Broad Institute or the ones that Fauci is using those actually give you CTs

08:11.360 --> 08:16.240
 all the time. I hate to say we call them this gentleman, the machine that the assay was run on

08:16.240 --> 08:21.840
 did not have access to the CT values. But again, it sort of shows you, you know, it would be great

08:21.840 --> 08:26.640
 spend that little bit of extra money and give us something that helps us in sort of figuring this

08:26.640 --> 08:32.080
 out. So as I mentioned, we've tried to move a little bit away from those deep NP swabs,

08:32.080 --> 08:38.800
 the brain biopsies, but still in some settings, we're doing those NP swabs, you know, particularly

08:38.800 --> 08:44.560
 with kids, we like to do it in the anterior inaries, particularly if you're going to be doing repeat

08:44.560 --> 08:48.880
 testing, because, you know, the blind procedure, we've had issues with triggering migraines, with

08:48.880 --> 08:56.480
 bleeding trauma, things like that. But actually some pretty exciting stuff here. We've really

08:56.480 --> 09:01.600
 moved ahead with access to rapid testing. And I don't know if I mentioned last time, but some

09:01.600 --> 09:09.120
 of our sites are doing over 6,000 tests a day. And what's, you know, when you start seeing, oh,

09:09.120 --> 09:16.240
 five, six percent or tests are positive, we're picking up hundreds of infected people per

09:16.240 --> 09:21.600
 site. And then we're actually getting them from spreading it to other people. So that's really

09:21.600 --> 09:25.920
 tremendous. I have to say, I'm excited to see this happening. I mean, testing saves lives.

09:25.920 --> 09:34.000
 As far as what tests do we have access to, the BD varitor is in reasonably good supply. We can

09:34.000 --> 09:39.680
 get reagents, we can get access to that. We have quite a bit of the Abbott ID now machines, but I

09:39.680 --> 09:43.920
 have to say I've talked to a lot of my colleagues who, you know, those are back ordered. It's hard

09:43.920 --> 09:49.280
 to get those now. There's such demand. There's also some, you know, other tests that people are

09:49.280 --> 09:56.000
 hearing about. The Abbott by neck by next now, right? That's supposed to be this $5 test. The

09:56.000 --> 10:01.520
 government has heavily invested in that. So most of us in the say the private sector are not getting

10:01.520 --> 10:09.280
 access to that. But now an approved at home over the counter test, no prescription needed. And I

10:09.280 --> 10:13.680
 think that's fantastic. I don't think a doctor needs to be standing between you and your ability

10:13.680 --> 10:20.480
 to get a COVID test. And this is by a lume. And it's a rapid antigen test. And it actually has the

10:20.480 --> 10:24.480
 ability has like this Bluetooth connection. And it's really kind of neat. So people, you know,

10:24.480 --> 10:31.840
 if you're not driving after this, just go ahead and Google E L L U M E COVID test. And for,

10:31.840 --> 10:36.080
 they say $30, you're going to be able to walk into your local pharmacy. You'll, you'll get this a

10:36.080 --> 10:40.480
 little kid. There's a video, right? So you're going to use, you need a smartphone, you know,

10:40.480 --> 10:44.800
 but you provide that. So you go on your smartphone, you watch a little video, it shows you how to do

10:44.800 --> 10:50.400
 this. There's a little sterile nasal swab, you're going to swab your nose. They actually say in the

10:50.400 --> 10:54.480
 kit, it's going to be an NP. They're actually going to expect you to put that back in there. So that's

10:54.480 --> 11:00.240
 going to be interesting to see how tolerated that is. There's a little droppers and processing fluid.

11:00.240 --> 11:05.920
 It connects via Bluetooth to your phone. And it walks you through it and in about 15 minutes,

11:05.920 --> 11:13.200
 you get an answer. So we're now sort of increasing the number of options and making it cheaper for

11:13.200 --> 11:20.480
 testing in the, in the home. We talked before about the Lucia, a little battery powered molecular test.

11:20.480 --> 11:27.440
 Now we have this hopefully soon to be available $30 over the counter antigen test. And there's

11:27.440 --> 11:34.560
 actually some talk about the, the binacs now being an at home option as well. So we're moving in

11:34.560 --> 11:38.400
 the right direction. We're not quite there at the price point. A lot of us are looking at, but this

11:38.400 --> 11:43.920
 is, I think it's exciting stuff. Schools, I always got to talk about schools. Really a nice piece

11:43.920 --> 11:51.920
 in the CDC MMWR. And this was titled estimating resource resource costs for implementation of

11:51.920 --> 11:59.600
 CDC's recommended COVID-19 mitigation strategies in pre kindergarten through grade 12 public schools,

11:59.600 --> 12:05.840
 United States 2020 to 21 school year. And they actually, it was really interesting. They went

12:05.840 --> 12:10.320
 through, and you know, to point out, this is not free. If you're going to say we're going to,

12:10.320 --> 12:14.160
 we're going to open our schools, we're going to send kids to the schools. You can't just do it

12:14.160 --> 12:18.160
 like it's 2019. You've got to do it like we're in the middle of a pandemic if you're even going

12:18.160 --> 12:22.960
 to consider this. And they actually went through and they found and made estimates. You need to

12:22.960 --> 12:30.320
 invest an average of $55 per student, sort of minimum. But then it goes up to about $440,

12:31.280 --> 12:37.600
 you know, with increased staffing, shields, mass hand sanitizer wipes, the pulse oximeters,

12:37.600 --> 12:43.040
 signage. So there's a lot involved. This is not just you say, oh, we're sending kids back to school,

12:43.040 --> 12:48.880
 we hear it's safe. If you're thinking about doing it, there's there are ways to approach this challenge,

12:48.880 --> 12:55.440
 but it takes money, it takes a plan. So I always try to reinforce the point that in-person schooling

12:55.440 --> 13:01.040
 is a goal, but you can't just jump there. You get there with education, you get there with resources,

13:01.760 --> 13:05.200
 and you know, and financial assistance, right? We dumped a lot of money, I would say into the

13:05.200 --> 13:09.920
 stock market. If we think we're going to send kids to school, if we think we're going to ask

13:09.920 --> 13:15.600
 teachers to go there, then we're going to actually have to have to put the money in. And I think

13:15.600 --> 13:20.000
 this was good analysis of schools can really understand what those costs should be. And hopefully,

13:20.000 --> 13:25.600
 we'll say policymakers can make the decisions to make this happen, because, you know, you look

13:25.600 --> 13:32.000
 at $440 per student, and you think about that enabling to, you know, parents to work, enabling

13:32.000 --> 13:40.480
 that child to get the benefits of education, I'll sort of leave it there. All right, vitamin D and

13:40.480 --> 13:46.240
 Ivermectin seems a lot to people want me to discuss this. So here's what I'm going to say.

13:46.240 --> 13:53.280
 I'm doing a better job of remembering to take my vitamin D. And if this podcast goes viral and

13:53.280 --> 13:58.640
 we get above 20,000 YouTube views, I promise to discuss Ivermectin next week. But we got way

13:58.640 --> 14:03.600
 too much other stuff for today. And why do we have too much other stuff vaccines? This has been an

14:03.600 --> 14:11.280
 exciting week for vaccines. Last week at Long Island Jewish Hospital, this is where I did my

14:11.280 --> 14:18.320
 training, also where I see a lot of patients. The first person, an ICU nurse, received the Pfizer

14:18.320 --> 14:23.520
 vaccine. And this was exciting, right? I mean, I think I was, you know, I'm always critical,

14:23.520 --> 14:27.600
 right? And so I'm looking and the fact that it's an ICU nurse and not a physician, I thought that

14:27.600 --> 14:32.000
 was pretty cool. The fact that physician was giving the vaccine seemed a little odd, because I'm not

14:32.000 --> 14:37.840
 sure we know how to do that. That's actually nurses are much better at that. So, but somehow

14:37.840 --> 14:42.160
 that doctor did well and the nurse claimed it didn't hurt. So we'll take your word for that.

14:43.040 --> 14:48.000
 And there was there was the tall Irishman, Michael Dowling, the head of Northwell was there. And

14:49.040 --> 14:53.520
 yeah, that was nice that, you know, there there's the Irish there. So, you know, we always sort of

14:53.520 --> 14:57.440
 the side of history. So that was exciting. Were you there, Daniel? Did you go?

14:57.440 --> 15:00.880
 No, no, you know, I actually was busy taking care of patients.

15:01.760 --> 15:05.520
 Okay. You know, and I did make the comment like, yeah, this is great that you've got the

15:05.520 --> 15:08.880
 media appearance. But come on, let's start pushing out the vaccine. It's here. Let's get it into

15:08.880 --> 15:16.400
 arms. Last week was all about Pfizer. And this week, the focus changes to Moderna. And so what do we

15:16.400 --> 15:21.840
 do about what do we know about Moderna? And as people may remember, last week, when Vincent

15:21.840 --> 15:30.480
 wanted to start Twiv, I was like, I can't. I'm watching. It's the vote. And so I did watch it again

15:30.480 --> 15:34.640
 today. You know, I guess I'm a, you know, if people listen to Twiv, they should have been tuned in.

15:34.640 --> 15:40.880
 If you want to hear a bunch of really smart nerds talk about stuff, it was great. I was loving it.

15:40.880 --> 15:44.480
 And they really, these are brilliant scientists. These are, you know, and it's not just scientists

15:44.480 --> 15:51.280
 and people looking at, you know, the whole equity aspect, etc. And what do we know? We got efficacy

15:51.280 --> 15:56.480
 data out of this. And it's right about, you know, the same as Pfizer. It's right about 95%

15:57.680 --> 16:03.360
 for preventing people from getting disease. Talk a little bit about what I mean. And they

16:03.360 --> 16:08.880
 really said it looked like it's close to 100% at preventing severe COVID-19. So I'm going to go a

16:08.880 --> 16:16.320
 little bit into that. People also are always interested in the immunological data, I guess I'll

16:16.320 --> 16:22.400
 say some T cell responses. So we know that we're getting great antibody responses. But they also

16:22.400 --> 16:29.280
 commented that the CD4 positive T-rays T cell responses were strongly biased as we wanted

16:29.280 --> 16:35.680
 towards TH1 cytokines, minimal TH2 cytokine expression. And so this is reassuring, right? Because this

16:35.680 --> 16:40.320
 is our way to predict the future. We're going to have any issues, vaccine induced disease.

16:40.320 --> 16:47.200
 As far as reactogenicity, hopefully our listeners remember this. This is not a side effect. This is,

16:47.200 --> 16:51.600
 I got the vaccine. And this is, you know, evidence that my immune system is working and evidence

16:51.600 --> 16:56.800
 that I can feel when people poke me with a needle. So it's pretty similar. The majority of people

16:56.800 --> 17:02.800
 said, yeah, it hurt when they stuck it into my, to my deltoid, unlike the nurse who claimed

17:02.800 --> 17:07.760
 the doctor poked her with minimal pain. You know, it's funny. The majority people,

17:07.760 --> 17:13.280
 the two days afterwards said they feel tired. Well, it's not funny, Dr. Griffin. What was funny

17:13.280 --> 17:17.280
 is that actually, if you ask the placebo people somewhere between a third and a half said, yeah,

17:17.280 --> 17:22.720
 I feel tired. So just to say, I haven't gotten my vaccine yet and I feel tired. So fatigue was

17:22.720 --> 17:28.400
 very common, but only lasting usually a day or two. Headache was reported, muscle pain,

17:28.400 --> 17:32.800
 some joint pain, some chills, and then a minority of people had fever. But again,

17:32.800 --> 17:39.760
 this was more after the second dose than the first dose. And interesting enough, the older you are,

17:40.480 --> 17:46.480
 the less you complain, the less reported side effects. And this seemed very similar when I went

17:46.480 --> 17:52.480
 through the numbers with Pfizer. What came up a bit in the discussion today was the issue of

17:52.480 --> 17:59.600
 Bell's palsy, right? There were a few cases of this in the Pfizer study. There were three cases of

17:59.600 --> 18:06.480
 this in the mode RNA vaccine group and one in the controls. And there was a whole discussion

18:06.480 --> 18:11.440
 about whether is that really background? Can we really say that with confidence? So that's

18:11.440 --> 18:17.680
 something that will be being monitored. Another part of the discussion that was quite interesting

18:18.560 --> 18:24.800
 and this will be addressed going forward was the issue about correlates of immunity. So what

18:24.800 --> 18:32.400
 they're hoping the Moderna vaccine trial will do is actually give us the ability to do blood

18:32.400 --> 18:37.200
 test to tell, do we have to worry about someone getting infected again? Also, it may help us with

18:37.200 --> 18:41.840
 timing about re-vaccination. And it was a slightly different discussion than Pfizer because

18:42.720 --> 18:46.720
 really this trial is being financed by the US government, right? This is very much under

18:47.280 --> 18:52.400
 Operation Warp Speed. So several times they'd say, well, we are paying for this trial. So this

18:52.400 --> 19:00.320
 is what we would like. Very interesting. But here are our vocabulary for today. So we have three

19:00.320 --> 19:09.120
 words I want people to learn about infection, disease, and severe disease. So I'm going to throw

19:09.120 --> 19:13.440
 in, we got a little bit of information about infection. I think this is important because

19:13.440 --> 19:19.040
 this is going to tie in with transmission. So the end point was not whether or not people got

19:19.040 --> 19:23.040
 infected. The secondary endpoint was not whether or not people got infected. It was whether or not

19:23.040 --> 19:28.080
 they get disease or whether or not it was severe disease. So what's infection? Can you get infection

19:28.080 --> 19:32.960
 without getting disease? And this is I think an important point. Our 12 listeners probably know

19:32.960 --> 19:37.520
 this, but it's good to sort of go through. So you've got the elevator response ready to go.

19:37.520 --> 19:44.160
 Sometimes a pathogen, a virus in this case, can actually infect us, use the same wording,

19:44.160 --> 19:49.040
 can actually go and start replicating. But we don't know it. We have no symptoms. We have no

19:49.040 --> 19:55.840
 fever. We have no headache. We are infected asymptomatically. The concern there is that if that

19:55.840 --> 20:01.040
 happens, if the vaccine does not prevent that, you could have people getting infected, walking

20:01.040 --> 20:07.680
 around feeling fine. They've got the virus replicating in their nasopharynx. They might wipe their nose,

20:07.680 --> 20:12.160
 they might talk, they might potentially transmit it and they feel fine. They're coming to work.

20:12.160 --> 20:17.040
 So there actually was a little bit of suggestion. Some data here was discussed on the last 12,

20:17.040 --> 20:22.800
 if people want to listen to that, that there may actually be a protection against infection.

20:22.800 --> 20:28.000
 And that's ideal if we're ever going to look at herd immunity. The second is disease. This is

20:28.000 --> 20:34.960
 you get sick, right? This is a subset of infected. You have the virus doing its thing and you either

20:34.960 --> 20:42.080
 have a sign or a symptom. Either you have a sign such as a measurable temperature, an abnormal chest

20:42.080 --> 20:48.160
 x-ray, or you have a symptom. You feel bad. You've got a cough. And then severe disease in COVID

20:48.160 --> 20:53.520
 really means that your oxygen level drops that you require hospitalization. And so in this study,

20:53.520 --> 21:00.400
 we saw some preliminary suggestion that there may be a decrease in infection. We saw some really

21:00.400 --> 21:06.640
 compelling evidence of about a 95% reduction in disease. And we saw what looks like close to 100%

21:07.440 --> 21:13.920
 protection against severe disease. So this is exciting. And they actually talked about moving

21:13.920 --> 21:17.680
 forward. They're planning. They talked about this at the beginning today. They're planning a

21:17.680 --> 21:24.960
 transmission study with the mode RNA vaccine this fall at university campuses, which I thought was

21:24.960 --> 21:29.120
 really interesting. So they're going to take a campus. These will be individuals who maybe have

21:29.120 --> 21:33.280
 not been vaccinated yet. And they're going to have half of them get vaccinated. Half of them

21:33.280 --> 21:38.880
 not get vaccinated. We blind it all the rest. And they're going to do really close contact tracing.

21:38.880 --> 21:45.200
 And they're also going to do repeated swaps looking at levels of virus. So very important

21:45.200 --> 21:49.760
 questions when we talk about herd immunity. Because if a vaccine protects you against disease,

21:49.760 --> 21:54.480
 but not infection, if it doesn't knock down levels and interrupt transmission,

21:54.480 --> 21:58.320
 then we really have to step back. We talk about herd immunity.

21:58.320 --> 22:04.800
 Daniel, what was the percentage in the prevention of asymptomatic infection? You didn't give us that.

22:04.800 --> 22:10.720
 You gave us the disease. I know. I believe it was 67%. Is that correct? Am I remembering that?

22:10.720 --> 22:15.680
 Yeah. So it's not great, right? So a lot of people are still going to not be protected from

22:15.680 --> 22:23.440
 infection, right? Yeah. And I think actually, I'm glad you, you know, so 67%. That's a problem.

22:23.440 --> 22:29.120
 Because if if it's only 67% and it's a binary system, is that enough to get us herd immunity,

22:29.120 --> 22:33.520
 right? If you say, OK, 100% of the population agrees to get vaccinated. I'm not sure what planet

22:33.520 --> 22:41.280
 that occurs on. And it's 67% effective at blocking infection. That's like right at the edge of

22:41.280 --> 22:46.480
 giving us herd immunity. You drop down to 90% and you're probably below herd immunity. So this

22:46.480 --> 22:51.440
 is a problem. And I think maybe sort of, you know, and the transmission research is so important,

22:51.440 --> 22:55.520
 because infection is one thing. But let's say you get infected, but it's at such a low level

22:55.520 --> 22:59.920
 you can't transmit. That's OK. And so I think that's what we'll get. Hopefully this fall.

23:01.120 --> 23:04.000
 No, it's actually people probably wanted to know that 67. So thank you.

23:04.880 --> 23:09.520
 All right. So we're getting lots of questions, right? The vaccines are out there. First question

23:09.520 --> 23:15.280
 I always get is Dr. Griffin, which is better. Is it Pfizer or Moderna? And we were joking about

23:15.280 --> 23:18.880
 this because, you know, saying, well, you know, it's kind of like the Android phone versus the,

23:18.880 --> 23:23.600
 you know, Apple iPhone, which one I get. I said, kind of like the Moderna, right? I think it's got

23:23.600 --> 23:27.680
 sort of nicer packaging, you know, the way Apple does that thing. And I said, but you know, to be

23:27.680 --> 23:30.800
 honest, if someone called me right now and said, Hey, Dr. Griffin, we've got your Pfizer

23:30.800 --> 23:35.120
 dose come running down. And I was like, yeah, probably just go get it. And so, and of course,

23:35.120 --> 23:38.800
 that day, like I got the call like, Hey, you know, Dr. Griffin, you want to schedule your Pfizer

23:38.800 --> 23:45.040
 vaccine as a guest. So I think the data is pretty compelling. You know, they're very, very similar

23:45.040 --> 23:51.280
 as far as efficacy as far as safety. So I, I think when you get your golden ticket, as we say,

23:51.280 --> 23:57.520
 the doctors are nurses and staff are getting their vaccines. I go ahead, take the opportunity

23:57.520 --> 24:04.880
 to get the vaccine. What about pregnant or breastfeeding? And this is, you know, this is an

24:04.880 --> 24:09.440
 E way. It's not a fully FDA approved vaccine. So I don't think we should be fighting with

24:09.440 --> 24:15.680
 anti-vaxxers. And the anti-vaxxers shouldn't be fighting with anyone at this point. We have not

24:15.680 --> 24:22.320
 tested this vaccine technology in pregnant or breastfeeding women, you know, humans, or even

24:22.320 --> 24:27.600
 animals for that for that matter. So it's unknown. There's there's no mechanism to think this is

24:27.600 --> 24:30.880
 an issue. There's no signal to think this is an issue. As we talked about last time,

24:30.880 --> 24:38.400
 the, the scientific advisory board and the FDA has made it really clear. This is a woman's decision.

24:38.400 --> 24:43.840
 This is not a man's decision. It's not the FDA's decision. The information is there,

24:43.840 --> 24:49.360
 and women have the ability to make this choice. And as we move forward, we're going to learn more.

24:49.360 --> 24:53.280
 So if you're, you know, if you're an ICU nurse and you're, you're involved in people getting

24:53.280 --> 24:58.720
 intubated and you're in high risk, or maybe you work in an ER or an urgent care, you may decide

24:58.720 --> 25:04.160
 I want to, I want to go right now. And, or you may decide, you know, hey, I'm, I'm doing more

25:04.160 --> 25:08.560
 administrative stuff. I have limited patient contact. You may decide you want to wait a little bit. So

25:09.280 --> 25:14.320
 again, we, that's, that's what we have. And people are, I think it's important that we respect

25:14.320 --> 25:20.800
 people's decisions here. What about autoimmune disease? We have seen no signal suggesting there's

25:20.800 --> 25:27.200
 a problem here. So again, the encouragement is, it seems, you know, that, that the scientific

25:27.200 --> 25:34.000
 evidence and totality favors vaccinating, getting vaccinated. What if I previously got infected?

25:34.640 --> 25:38.480
 I'm going to talk about that a little bit, but I think it was very clear in the discussion

25:38.480 --> 25:43.920
 today by the independent scientific advisory board. I just sort of to quote, is we know people get

25:43.920 --> 25:48.640
 reinfected. We sometimes see the reinfection is worse than the primary infection.

25:50.080 --> 25:55.520
 We actually had people get a mild case and then die the second time. So the encouragement was

25:55.520 --> 26:00.640
 that you should go ahead and get vaccinated. We have no, no correlates of immunity. There's no

26:00.640 --> 26:05.600
 blood tests that we can do right now to tell you you're going to be okay. What about distribution?

26:05.600 --> 26:12.480
 I was asked about this. Right now we still don't have as much product as demand. But that's going

26:12.480 --> 26:18.240
 to, we expect to quickly change, particularly, it sounds like we'll have six million doses of

26:18.800 --> 26:24.160
 Moderna or mode RNA vaccine coming out next week and other three million of Pfizer will ship.

26:24.160 --> 26:28.720
 And so I think that I think pretty soon we're going to get to the point where we can meet that

26:28.720 --> 26:32.560
 demand. And there's really a lot of people, as I mentioned, all hands on deck to try to make this

26:32.560 --> 26:37.920
 happen. As there have been some reports, I think three allergic reactions to the Pfizer vaccine.

26:37.920 --> 26:43.520
 Can you illuminate? Yeah. So the one in the US, I think that got a little bit of press as they

26:43.520 --> 26:49.520
 gave it to an individual up in Alaska, right? And there were a couple in the UK that early on.

26:49.520 --> 26:55.200
 So there is that that warning that we say that if you have had a previous

26:55.200 --> 27:00.640
 anaphylactic reaction to a vaccine, you should speak to your physician,

27:00.640 --> 27:06.080
 consider premedication, don't just sort of run in there and get the vaccine. And I think that's

27:06.080 --> 27:11.760
 the important. It is a previous severe reaction to a vaccine. It's not egg allergy. It's not,

27:11.760 --> 27:16.640
 I have issues with pollen. It's not peanuts. It's not an antibiotic issue. It's just, you know,

27:16.640 --> 27:20.960
 and that's the question. Have you had a previous severe reaction to a vaccine? If the answer is no,

27:21.600 --> 27:26.000
 you can move ahead. After you get a vaccine, you shouldn't you be observed for 15 minutes to make

27:26.000 --> 27:31.120
 sure nothing happens? Yeah, they've actually extended it in a lot of the places here to 30

27:31.120 --> 27:37.360
 minutes. But the recommendation is observation for a minimum of 15 minutes. And as we learn more,

27:37.360 --> 27:48.560
 we'll see. But yeah, that's recommended. The two shots, right? So the Pfizer-BioNTech is a 0.3 milliliter

27:48.560 --> 27:55.600
 shot, given 21 days apart, you get a second shot. So it's two shots. Interesting thing people have

27:55.600 --> 28:00.400
 probably heard about is, Oh my gosh, there's more doses in that vial than we knew. So I'll

28:00.400 --> 28:05.040
 talk a little bit about that. I was asked one of our pharmacists who's been actually reconstituting

28:05.040 --> 28:11.920
 this today. And these vials, when you actually thought of there's about 0.2 milliliters of

28:11.920 --> 28:16.320
 liquid in there about 0.2, right? So there's a certain amount of the product in there,

28:16.320 --> 28:21.920
 and there's a certain amount of volume that that comes up. You add 1.8 milliliters,

28:21.920 --> 28:26.800
 you can do the math. That gives you about two milliliters. They're always slightly overfilled.

28:27.600 --> 28:32.240
 So you say, well, I'm going to do the math in my head here, Dr. Griffin, 0.3 times 5, 1.5,

28:32.240 --> 28:37.920
 that leaves half a milliliter of fluid in every vial or so. And that's what was actually noticed.

28:38.960 --> 28:43.440
 So Pfizer was alerted. Pfizer said, listen, we're not going to give any specific recommendation,

28:43.440 --> 28:48.480
 but your hospital might make a decision about this. And what a lot of the hospitals have done,

28:48.480 --> 28:54.080
 and the health care system where I'm working, has actually said they will draw an extra dose

28:54.080 --> 28:58.160
 out of that vial, if possible, if there's an extra 0.3 in there, which there always is.

28:58.160 --> 29:06.400
 And sometimes there's even another dose in there, because we say about 0.2. So sometimes it's

29:06.400 --> 29:12.560
 about 2.1 at the end. But they do say, don't draw a little bit out of 1, a little bit out of another

29:12.560 --> 29:20.000
 worried about cross-contamination infection risks. But that's the mystery there. The Moderna is

29:20.000 --> 29:24.880
 actually a slightly larger volume. And we've always talked about from a nursing point. We have to

29:24.880 --> 29:30.800
 be careful that people are just sort of straight with how much they draw. So the Moderna is 0.5 ml,

29:30.800 --> 29:37.280
 so it's a little bit larger amount that goes in. Again, two shots, about 28 days apart. And then I

29:37.280 --> 29:42.720
 guess just to wrap that off, Pfizer is being sent around in those cool thermal shippers.

29:42.720 --> 29:47.360
 They monitor until they arrive and then switches over, someone else monitors it. So they can

29:47.360 --> 29:50.640
 actually be kept in those thermal shippers. So we're not going to necessarily need everyone in

29:50.640 --> 29:56.320
 the world to have an ultra cold. Moderna can be shipped around at negative 20 and then kept in

29:56.320 --> 30:01.680
 a fridge. We think it's going to be for about a month. So good stuff there on excess and getting

30:01.680 --> 30:08.560
 it around. All right, incubation period. I want to make sure I hit this. Remember, a test does not

30:08.560 --> 30:14.000
 predict the future. Just on the phone again with a dad who said, you know, his one son got sick,

30:14.000 --> 30:21.760
 tested positive, isolated for his 10 days. You know, he and the other boys had a test a couple

30:21.760 --> 30:26.400
 days after the first son tested positive. So, you know, his comment was, we should be all good to

30:26.400 --> 30:31.280
 go. And it's like, actually, your last contact was, you know, 10 days ago. So you're still within

30:31.280 --> 30:37.200
 the 14 day quarantine. That test a couple days after your son got sick, that doesn't quite work.

30:38.080 --> 30:43.120
 Naturally, a CDC has said you can finish that quarantine at day seven with a negative test

30:43.120 --> 30:49.680
 within 40 hours. New York State's still sticking with its 14 day quarantine. And I have to say,

30:49.680 --> 30:54.240
 we're being really strict. I got, you know, another call from the NHL with it was this,

30:55.200 --> 30:59.840
 this, you know, question about, you know, do they have to be PCR negative? Or can we switch over

30:59.840 --> 31:05.120
 to this 10 days 21 days? And I know if people are familiar with this, but in youth hockey,

31:05.120 --> 31:10.160
 something about the dynamic of the ice makes it the highest risk situation for transmission

31:10.160 --> 31:15.040
 of virus from one person to another in a sporting context. So still sticking with a

31:15.920 --> 31:22.560
 really strict no tolerance policy for professional hockey. So expect another great season next year.

31:22.560 --> 31:28.000
 Period of detectable viral replication. Here I'm going to talk about the other type of vaccination,

31:28.000 --> 31:33.120
 passive vaccination, right? And this is the type of vaccine that the president, Ben Carson,

31:34.080 --> 31:39.440
 Chris Christie, Rudy Giuliani, and now many, many other people are getting. And I'm now starting

31:39.440 --> 31:44.880
 to see a significant number of people who go for this. Some of them end up in the hospital,

31:44.880 --> 31:51.040
 right? This is not 100%. First person I saw was a gentleman, right? Got it on day four,

31:51.040 --> 31:56.000
 two days later, felt great. Another gentleman got it on day nine. Didn't really notice much,

31:56.000 --> 32:02.240
 ended up in the hospital. But we're seeing a lot of people get this. The earlier they get it seems

32:02.240 --> 32:07.920
 to be consistent with what we knew from before. The suggestion is, if you get these monoconal

32:07.920 --> 32:14.640
 antibodies within the first week, there's about a 70% reduction in progressing to hospitalization.

32:15.440 --> 32:23.120
 The U.S. government is actually distributing 65,000 doses every week. But only about 20% of

32:23.120 --> 32:28.400
 them are getting used. So there's a problem here. Hopefully people are listening to this.

32:28.400 --> 32:35.360
 Let's get the word out. So the BAM linibimab, the BAM BAM, is really widely available. But

32:35.360 --> 32:39.040
 people don't know about it, actually, to the point where even people that don't qualify

32:39.760 --> 32:43.040
 are actually getting it through a lottery system because the hospitals are sitting

32:43.040 --> 32:48.720
 with these vials not being used. So Eli Lilly has a place. You could actually go to the Eli Lilly

32:48.720 --> 32:54.160
 page. And there's numbers. And actually here in New York, I get lots of calls. I send them the

32:54.160 --> 32:59.760
 hotline. There's a hotline you call. I just had another patient today, actually a fellow clinician,

32:59.760 --> 33:05.840
 elderly gentleman or senior gentleman. I don't know if elderly is the right word, but an older adult above 65.

33:05.840 --> 33:11.920
 And he was being arranged to get the BAM linibimab in fusion today. So this is one of those tools.

33:11.920 --> 33:18.640
 This does have some data behind it. And as people may know, I'm working on a trial, a post-EUA

33:18.640 --> 33:24.640
 trial to really get solid data. This is still EUA based on phase one, too. We're hoping to get

33:24.640 --> 33:32.640
 more solid data to move forward with this. What about reinfection? So I wanted to ask this question.

33:32.640 --> 33:36.640
 I wanted to say, OK, so what about reinfection? And what I wanted to really be curious about,

33:36.640 --> 33:42.560
 do people get reinfected and potentially shed it to others? So we now have a lot of cases

33:42.560 --> 33:46.880
 in the literature of really well-documented reinfection. So what I wanted two things.

33:46.880 --> 33:51.600
 I wanted them to be young. I wanted them to be in their 20s with no medical problems.

33:51.600 --> 33:55.600
 And two, I wanted them to be health care workers. So I wanted them to be in a situation where,

33:55.600 --> 34:00.240
 potentially, they got it. They got it again. And they also, you're ready. My last was,

34:00.240 --> 34:04.480
 I wanted CT values. I wanted to know, did they have enough virus that I would be concerned that

34:04.480 --> 34:10.880
 they would transmit? So I found a nice article by Gupta V et al, asymptomatic reinfection in

34:10.880 --> 34:18.400
 two health care workers from India with genetically distinct SARS-CoV-2. One was a 25-year-old man,

34:18.400 --> 34:25.760
 PCR positive 5th of May, 2020. CT value at the time 36, right? So a few thousand bits of RNA when

34:25.760 --> 34:33.440
 he's initially diagnosed. They isolate him. They wait till his PCR is negative. They get him back

34:33.440 --> 34:42.000
 at work. August 17th. Now he's got a positive PCR with a CT value of 16.6. So that would be

34:42.000 --> 34:46.480
 millions and millions of RNA copy numbers. So something we would think that we'd be worried

34:46.480 --> 34:53.280
 about for transmission. Other 28-year-old woman found PCR positive also back in May. CT value

34:53.280 --> 35:01.840
 at that point in the 20s. She did the institution. She became PCR negative. September 5th. CT value

35:01.840 --> 35:09.520
 of 16.9. So again, very high levels of RNA. So this raises the couple issues that we got back

35:09.520 --> 35:15.760
 to with our vocabulary. This was an issue of reinfection. They were asymptomatic. So there was no disease.

35:15.760 --> 35:20.160
 There was no severe disease. But they had really high levels suggesting potential

35:21.040 --> 35:29.200
 for transmission in these settings. Early inflammatory phase. I want to reinforce the timing of steroids.

35:29.200 --> 35:33.920
 I got to call the other day. It was like, Dad, the steroids here to be doing really well for our

35:33.920 --> 35:38.000
 patients in the hospital. I got a person who just got COVID. Should I call in a script for steroids?

35:38.000 --> 35:43.520
 Steroids are the second week. They're in select individuals who are hypoxic, who are starting to

35:43.520 --> 35:50.560
 develop more significant disease. They're not for everyone. It's not COVID steroids. It's just

35:50.560 --> 35:56.480
 select people. It's a select dose. A little judgment here. Secondary infection phase.

35:57.280 --> 36:03.280
 We talked a little bit about the ferritin procalcitonin ratio. But I want to point out that the timing

36:03.280 --> 36:10.320
 seems to me to be the most helpful. I just had a woman today. Procalcitonin was less than 0.05.

36:10.320 --> 36:16.240
 The FPR, the ferritin procalcitonin ratio, was super high, suggesting not bacterial.

36:16.880 --> 36:21.600
 But she had staph aureus in the blood. Why can't it went up? She wasn't looking right.

36:22.480 --> 36:27.120
 So I still find that you want to be vigilant. You want to understand the phases of disease.

36:27.120 --> 36:31.840
 And when something starts to change, think about the complications that happen in that phase of

36:31.840 --> 36:41.040
 disease. The tail phase, which often ends up with the long COVID, I was actually speaking with a nurse

36:41.040 --> 36:47.120
 this week. It's really tough. We're seeing individuals who are now six, seven, eight months out,

36:47.120 --> 36:52.320
 really getting pretty far out from initial disease, still suffering. And some of the employers are

36:52.320 --> 36:57.120
 starting to get tired and say, hey, what's going on here? And I think we talked about this a little

36:57.120 --> 37:02.720
 last time. There really isn't a great chronic diagnosis here. It puts these people in a really

37:02.720 --> 37:10.160
 tough situation. But it's very clear. COVID is not just binary. You can get sick. You can die.

37:10.160 --> 37:14.000
 You could get sick. You could not die. And you might have prolonged suffering. You might have

37:14.000 --> 37:19.360
 prolonged disability. So I want to leave it there. I want to thank everyone for all the hard work

37:19.360 --> 37:23.520
 everyone's doing. Hang in there. Keep doing it. And for everybody who's been coming to parasites

37:23.520 --> 37:27.840
 with that borders.com and helping us. That's fantastic. Thank you. We're continuing to help the

37:27.840 --> 37:33.680
 P scores HIV and AIDS programs. Because remember, that virus has not gone away. All right, Daniel,

37:33.680 --> 37:40.400
 a couple of quick questions. First one is Ellen from Johns Hopkins, assuming one has been vaccinated

37:40.400 --> 37:46.560
 and then becomes infected with SARS-CoV-2. One, do we know the degree to which that person's virus

37:46.560 --> 37:53.680
 shedding is infectious? And two, can that person become a long hauler? Oh, that was fantastic.

37:54.240 --> 37:59.760
 Because that hits right into what we were talking about. We don't know yet. And we're going to get

37:59.760 --> 38:03.680
 this data. This is actually the planned transmission studies that we heard about. They're going to

38:03.680 --> 38:08.480
 be taking individuals and vaccinating, comparing them to non-vaccinated individuals. And they're

38:08.480 --> 38:15.520
 actually going to be doing quantitative viral load testing and coupled with transmission

38:15.520 --> 38:19.760
 contact tracing. So we're going to get answers to this. We don't know yet. And I think this is

38:19.760 --> 38:24.720
 really critical. A lot of people I saw this early on in the pandemic, they get the COVID.

38:24.720 --> 38:29.360
 They'd say, oh, I'm fine. The mask would be off. They would feel like they had some special

38:29.360 --> 38:36.480
 invisible magic shield. We don't know. The vaccine may protect you from infection. We've seen

38:36.480 --> 38:42.960
 evidence for that. It seems very compelling that it infects you from disease and severe disease.

38:42.960 --> 38:47.760
 But we don't know. You could very well get infected. You could have high enough viral

38:47.760 --> 38:51.440
 level that you could then infect your loved ones of your patients. So until we know that,

38:51.440 --> 38:54.800
 you got to keep washing your hands. You got to keep wearing your mask. You got to keep acting

38:54.800 --> 38:59.440
 like we're in the middle of a pandemic. All right. So Alan asked about allergic reactions after

38:59.440 --> 39:04.880
 vaccination. We already covered that. So we can skip that. And then Dr. Hasanane says,

39:04.880 --> 39:09.760
 can someone like President Trump who received monoclonal antibodies get the vaccine now?

39:09.760 --> 39:14.080
 Or will he have antibodies that may neutralize the spike protein once formed?

39:14.080 --> 39:18.960
 Yeah. So we think that that's a concern. And we're actually recommending that people wait

39:18.960 --> 39:25.040
 90 days. And that's based upon, we'll say, the half-life of the monoclonal

39:25.040 --> 39:29.760
 bammative about by Eli Lilly is 21 days. So we're waiting for that to get low enough.

39:29.760 --> 39:34.960
 Because otherwise, the concern is you get the vaccine and you actually will not get the benefit

39:34.960 --> 39:40.720
 of vaccination. The half-life is pretty similar for the cocktail from Regeneron. The GSK product

39:40.720 --> 39:44.240
 hasn't made it to market yet. That doesn't even longer half-life. So that may really

39:44.240 --> 39:49.520
 prevent you from getting active vaccination for some time. But the current recommendation is to

39:49.520 --> 39:57.200
 wait 90 days. One more from Nicholas as a health care worker myself on the front lines every day

39:57.200 --> 40:01.360
 who has suffered from COVID-19. What are the recommendations for vaccination? Should I move

40:01.360 --> 40:06.400
 myself to the back of the list since I may have antibodies? Are there any concerns for

40:06.400 --> 40:10.640
 someone to get the vaccine after having suffered from COVID-19?

40:11.600 --> 40:16.240
 Yeah. So there's two questions here that I'll sort of tease out. One is there's no risk that

40:16.240 --> 40:20.480
 we're aware of that a person is going to get the vaccine and have a problem because they had

40:20.480 --> 40:25.840
 COVID before, right? And Pfizer had a number of people who had been previously infected,

40:25.840 --> 40:32.560
 get vaccinated, the chat-ox study, the Oxford AstraZeneca also had a similar where people were

40:32.560 --> 40:38.560
 fine to get the vaccine. The other is a prioritization issue. Should I get this? Should I wait and let

40:38.560 --> 40:44.240
 all my colleagues get it first? The hospital's health care systems, this is a monumental challenge

40:44.240 --> 40:48.240
 to get everyone vaccinated. I've basically been telling people if they call your number,

40:48.240 --> 40:52.720
 if your golden ticket comes up and it's time to get vaccinated, go ahead, get vaccinated.

40:52.720 --> 40:57.760
 Try to get all the health care workers at least their first dose this month. So just go ahead,

40:57.760 --> 41:02.560
 keep the logistics flowing. Make sure you jump in the lifeboat before we run out type thing.

41:03.760 --> 41:08.400
 So don't wait. Just go ahead, get vaccinated. I'm encouraging people to do that.

41:08.400 --> 41:14.560
 That's COVID-19 clinical update number 41 with Dr. Daniel Griffin. Thank you, Daniel.

41:14.560 --> 41:22.880
 Oh, thank you. Everyone, take care and be safe.
