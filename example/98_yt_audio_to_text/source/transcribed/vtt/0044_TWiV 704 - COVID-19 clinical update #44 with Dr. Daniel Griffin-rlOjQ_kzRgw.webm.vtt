 This week in virology, the podcast about viruses, the kind that make you sick.

00:10.320 --> 00:21.040
 From MicrobeTV, this is Twiv. This week in virology, episode 704, recorded on January 7th, 2021.

00:21.600 --> 00:28.400
 I'm Vincent Drackeniello, and you're listening to the podcast All About Viruses. Joining me today

00:28.400 --> 00:37.200
 from New York, Daniel Griffin. Hello, everyone. Clinical update, 44, the first for 2021, Daniel.

00:38.240 --> 00:43.360
 It is. It is. And I'm hoping that this is a better year. I was just going to say, Daniel,

00:43.360 --> 00:49.040
 is this going to be a better year? Yes, it will be. Well, let me put it this way.

00:49.040 --> 00:57.760
 Is it starting off in a better way? No, no, it is not. You know, it's sort of arbitrary,

00:57.760 --> 01:04.000
 right that, you know, 2020 ended on a specific date, but the pandemic doesn't respect that.

01:05.040 --> 01:10.240
 So yeah, I mean, so let me start with my quotation, and then we'll get right back to how bad things

01:10.240 --> 01:18.640
 are. And maybe when I, as I read this, people recognize it. I will respect the hard one,

01:18.640 --> 01:25.360
 hard one scientific gains of those physicians in whose steps I walk and gladly share such

01:25.360 --> 01:31.360
 knowledge as is mine with those who are to follow. I will apply for the benefit of the sick,

01:31.360 --> 01:37.840
 all measures that are required, avoiding those twin traps of overtreatment and therapeutic

01:37.840 --> 01:45.360
 nihilism. I will remember that there is art to medicine, as well as science, and that warmth,

01:45.360 --> 01:51.120
 sympathy, and understanding may outweigh the surgeon's knife or the chemist's drug.

01:51.120 --> 01:57.600
 I will not be ashamed to say, I know not, nor will I fail to call in my colleagues when the

01:57.600 --> 02:04.000
 skills of another are needed for a patient's recovery. I know what that is, and I'm not a doctor.

02:04.880 --> 02:11.440
 And what is that? It's a Hippocratic oath. It is. Now, this is the modern version, and this was

02:11.440 --> 02:17.680
 actually written in 1964 by Louis lasagna, the academic dean of the School of Medicine at Tuft.

02:17.680 --> 02:22.320
 So it's updated. If people ever go back and read the original, it's a little interesting.

02:22.320 --> 02:27.440
 It's not what we think of. So I wanted to throw that out there.

02:27.440 --> 02:31.200
 Your background has changed a bit. I see some viral flowers, right?

02:32.480 --> 02:37.440
 Yes. So this is actually a gift over, I guess, this shoulder, right? I'm backwards,

02:37.440 --> 02:40.400
 so this shoulder. Let's see if I can see the show typing.

02:40.400 --> 02:48.160
 Well, I'm trying to. But over my shoulder is a bouquet of pathogens.

02:48.800 --> 02:54.000
 Wow. And this was actually created by my wife's youngest sister, Genevieve.

02:54.880 --> 03:02.080
 And it's got there's the coronavirus that perhaps people recognize in there. There's HIV,

03:02.080 --> 03:10.240
 there's syphilis, there's tuberculosis. We've got hercinia pestis. This is a whole bunch in there.

03:11.360 --> 03:12.560
 I like it. I like it.

03:13.360 --> 03:16.800
 Yeah, people are always wondering how I put the books up there, but I think the books have

03:16.800 --> 03:22.160
 all fallen, right? They've all fallen off. It's a good thing. It's a good change for the new year,

03:22.160 --> 03:24.480
 Daniel. Yeah, they're all on the floor.

03:24.480 --> 03:31.280
 All right. So people probably know that things are tough.

03:32.320 --> 03:36.480
 And it's really hard for us to take care of patients and provide the same level of care

03:36.480 --> 03:42.960
 when numbers rise. The latest reports, I think people have probably heard, reminded me of a

03:42.960 --> 03:49.680
 conversation that actually was rich, rich. And Alan, we're reaching out with words of advice,

03:49.680 --> 03:53.120
 things to do. When we were running out of oxygen in New York, I don't know if people

03:53.120 --> 03:59.040
 remember that. And I know Northwell has been in the press negative stuff lately.

03:59.760 --> 04:04.080
 But one of the things that they did at some of our local hospitals is they really upgraded

04:04.080 --> 04:12.000
 the oxygen system. So we have a lot of oxygen supply capacity that we did not have a year ago.

04:13.120 --> 04:17.440
 And a lot of things that were happening a year ago, we were running out of oxygen. We were actually

04:17.440 --> 04:22.080
 wheeling in mobile tanks to some of the rooms to keep up with the demands. We actually got to

04:22.080 --> 04:26.960
 one point when we were discussing, we were going to reach out to the aviation industry,

04:26.960 --> 04:32.640
 out to the airports. What can we do to get more oxygen? So right now, at least in New York,

04:32.640 --> 04:37.760
 in some of the hospitals where I'm working, people thought ahead. And they actually, they put in

04:37.760 --> 04:43.680
 the money, they upgraded the oxygen. And we're able to keep a lot of people off of ventilators,

04:43.680 --> 04:49.520
 where we'll keep people's oxygen at a good level by doing a lot of high flow oxygen delivery

04:49.520 --> 04:55.360
 techniques that we couldn't do before. But this requires a lot of attention. I sort of mentioned

04:55.360 --> 05:00.720
 the art of medicine. There was a woman the other day, and the nurse was calling out,

05:00.720 --> 05:04.400
 I need a doctor. And I went in and it was an older woman. It's actually one of the other

05:04.400 --> 05:10.640
 infectious disease doctors, Dr. Fatima Johari was taking care of her and excellence. Nice to have

05:10.640 --> 05:17.760
 the help of such high quality colleagues. But this woman had had the BIPAPON, which is somewhat

05:17.760 --> 05:23.040
 suffocating. And she's an older woman and she's frightened and she feels ill and she's alone

05:23.040 --> 05:28.400
 because of the isolation of the COVID. And it really was a question of me sitting there,

05:28.400 --> 05:33.200
 holding her hand, getting her to take deep breaths, getting her to relax, getting her to

05:33.200 --> 05:40.000
 allow the oxygen to stay on. We still need to do that. These are human beings. You can't just

05:40.000 --> 05:44.880
 check off a box and walk out of the room and have systems and things take care of them. They

05:44.880 --> 05:51.200
 need people at the bedside. So as the numbers rise, not only how are you supposed to hold the hand

05:51.840 --> 05:58.160
 of a frightened woman with requiring oxygen and this claustrophobic feeling device

05:59.040 --> 06:02.880
 when you've got so many other people. And as we're seeing sort of the horrors of LA,

06:03.920 --> 06:10.400
 where they're telling the ambulances, conserve your oxygen. Because if the person requires too

06:10.400 --> 06:17.120
 much oxygen, let's sort of triage. Don't bring them here. It's really, I have to say, kind of,

06:17.120 --> 06:22.480
 well, it is very troubling just to say that. Numbers are bad here. One of the things that I

06:22.480 --> 06:30.800
 point out, one thing that really was devastating in the first wave here in New York, about 50% of

06:30.800 --> 06:34.480
 the deaths, about half of the people coming into the hospitals were coming in from nursing homes

06:34.480 --> 06:40.240
 from group homes. We published on this. A lot of people have really, how do you keep those people

06:40.240 --> 06:46.000
 safe? A lot of them died during the first wave. We're not really seeing those in the first wave.

06:46.640 --> 06:52.080
 We had about say about 80 when we maxed out 80 community dwelling people with COVID. We're now

06:52.080 --> 06:57.760
 up to about 90 or 100 community dwelling at one of the hospitals where I was actually this morning.

06:58.640 --> 07:03.200
 So we're seeing more of the community, but we're not seeing those nursing home

07:03.200 --> 07:07.200
 individuals. We're starting to get vaccinated or keep them safe. There's testing other measures.

07:07.200 --> 07:15.840
 We're not sending infected infectious people into those settings. So, yeah, I think we, well,

07:15.840 --> 07:22.320
 we're going to probably pass 4,000 deaths per day this month, but we were pretty darn close

07:22.320 --> 07:26.640
 yesterday. We'll see what the numbers are today. So things are not going well.

07:27.440 --> 07:34.000
 Now, why did I start off with the Hippocratic oath? It's because I wanted to sort of bring us

07:34.000 --> 07:41.600
 back to I think the paradigms I talked about, the evidence, the vehemence, the eloquence,

07:41.600 --> 07:46.240
 the diffidence, the nervousness, and then the evidence-based medicine. But I also want to

07:46.240 --> 07:52.320
 throw a second thing in that I think people will maybe sort of think about and maybe they started

07:52.320 --> 07:58.000
 to already get this flavor as I talk. There's actually two splits that I'm going to say in practice

07:58.000 --> 08:05.760
 style. One is derived from Hippocratic philosophy, but as you'll, as you may have noticed, it was

08:05.760 --> 08:14.800
 not in the oath. And this is the first do no harm, the premium known nocere. And that's really this

08:14.800 --> 08:20.640
 idea of don't do something unless you know it's going to make a difference. And there's a second

08:20.640 --> 08:26.240
 style that I want to be respectful of, which is if we think something can help, let's go ahead and

08:26.240 --> 08:32.720
 try it. Now, I'll say in calmer times, the less is more that do not treat your patients with

08:32.720 --> 08:37.920
 untested therapeutics has been more of a common approach. It's definitely been more of the academic

08:37.920 --> 08:44.000
 approach. This is the philosophy behind having an FDA restricting the use of prescription medications

08:44.000 --> 08:48.960
 to highly trained licensed professionals. You certainly wouldn't take anything off the bench,

08:48.960 --> 08:54.480
 no concoction, no nothing that you think would work and then put it into a patient without doing

08:54.480 --> 08:59.200
 safety and other trials. But there's a gray area, a lot of the medicines that we use, we've been

08:59.200 --> 09:05.680
 using for many, many years, but never really actually doing those randomized control trials

09:05.680 --> 09:12.720
 that we sort of have required or said are the gold standard. And I clearly, right, I clearly am,

09:12.720 --> 09:17.360
 you know, of the school where I respect the randomized control trials. But I just wanted to

09:17.360 --> 09:22.000
 point out there's there's two different styles here. I learned from actually watching both

09:22.000 --> 09:26.400
 styles. There certainly are a lot of individuals that try things at the bedside and I watched that

09:26.400 --> 09:31.200
 and learned from it. And sometimes this actually leads to us going ahead and doing those randomized

09:31.200 --> 09:38.400
 control trials. So all right, just wanted to throw that out as we started, because we have some we

09:38.400 --> 09:44.960
 have some new information. And I'm going to jump into the lot of vaccination arms here.

09:44.960 --> 09:51.040
 So one thing I want to talk about is passive vaccination. And what are the two types of

09:51.040 --> 09:55.040
 passive vaccination that we know about? Well, I'm going to get to monoclonal antibodies,

09:55.040 --> 10:01.680
 but we had a study out of Argentina funded by the Gates Foundation, early high titer plasma

10:01.680 --> 10:07.440
 therapy to prevent severe COVID-19 in older adults. This was just published in the New England Journal

10:07.440 --> 10:13.280
 of Medicine. And I want to say this, this was done the way I think going back to March, April,

10:14.480 --> 10:18.560
 convalescent plasma should have been studied. What they did is they actually,

10:18.560 --> 10:26.000
 they took convalescent plasma, they identified convalescent plasma that had high titer neutralizing

10:26.000 --> 10:32.160
 antibodies, and they gave it early. They gave it within the first 72 hours. So this was a randomized

10:32.160 --> 10:39.360
 double blind placebo control trial of convalescent plasma with high IgG tighters neutralizing

10:39.360 --> 10:45.600
 antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome, coronavirus two, SARS-CoV-2, in older

10:45.600 --> 10:52.480
 adults given within 72 hours of the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. So they're still in that first week,

10:52.480 --> 10:59.440
 they're in that critical viral replication window. 160 patients underwent randomization.

11:00.800 --> 11:08.240
 A severe disease developed 16%. People that convalescent plasma, 31% in people that got placebo.

11:08.240 --> 11:14.560
 So a relative risk reduction, basically about by half, about 50%. And they didn't see any

11:14.560 --> 11:20.320
 significant adverse events, which makes sense. You're giving this to healthy outpatient people

11:20.320 --> 11:27.760
 that have not gone into the second, the inflammatory phase. So I think this finally builds on trends

11:27.760 --> 11:34.240
 that we saw on a lot of other trials. The idea that high tighters neutralizing antibodies given

11:34.240 --> 11:40.400
 in the appropriate window, not giving it late, all the issues that we saw there. So hopefully,

11:40.400 --> 11:46.640
 this is going to guide people who are looking at using convalescent plasma. And many parts of

11:46.640 --> 11:52.960
 the world, the monoclonal's I'm about to talk about, may not be available. We talk about convalescent

11:52.960 --> 12:00.160
 plasma being a resource intensive therapy, but it's not quite as expensive as the monoclonal

12:00.160 --> 12:07.440
 antibodies. So let's go into the next, the next passive vaccination area. And I have some, I'll say

12:07.440 --> 12:14.080
 really, I think, positive developments here. So bam, linibomav, that's really the monoclonal

12:14.080 --> 12:20.880
 antibody that we're being used the most. That's the Eli Lilly product, the Regeneron product,

12:20.880 --> 12:28.960
 also has EUA, doesn't quite got as much attention. But the Mayo Clinic, which is treated over 2000

12:28.960 --> 12:34.480
 patients, and Houston Methodist, which is treated over 1000, they're doing about 70 patients a day

12:34.480 --> 12:40.080
 there, they shared their experience, right? So a lot of clinicians were concerned about monoclonals

12:40.080 --> 12:46.320
 got EUA with just looking at 100, 200 folks, a little over 200 folks in those, each of those trials.

12:46.320 --> 12:50.400
 And so people were saying, you know, how can you, how can you really go ahead and make this

12:50.400 --> 12:56.080
 standard of care without more experience? So now we've had thousands of people, a post EUA

12:56.080 --> 13:02.880
 experience, not in a formal trial. And here the reports were very similar safety profile,

13:02.880 --> 13:08.240
 actually went over this with the people at Eli Lilly about a week ago. And that's what

13:08.240 --> 13:14.880
 we're seeing at the Mayo in Houston, and about a 70% reduction in people progressing to require

13:14.880 --> 13:22.640
 any hospital level care, any oxygen, any ER visits. So I look at this, I say, this is pretty impressive.

13:22.640 --> 13:28.800
 Here is a therapy, you know, steroids, what 2% mortality benefit. Here's a therapy that if you

13:28.800 --> 13:36.560
 give this to people in the first week of illness, sort of earlier, the better, a 75% reduction in

13:36.560 --> 13:41.120
 those people going on to require any medical care, keeping these people out of the hospital.

13:41.920 --> 13:47.120
 And the Mayo people actually suggested that they were starting to see evidence of decreased

13:47.120 --> 13:52.080
 mortality, and actually suggesting that will this will eventually lead to a peer reviewed

13:52.080 --> 13:57.760
 publication. So I think that's exciting. And I'll sort of throw in here, you know,

13:57.760 --> 14:02.720
 the issue that we've seen across the board, it's just like the vaccines, only 20, 30% of the doses

14:02.720 --> 14:07.440
 are getting to people, the rest of them are sitting there. We just opened up our United in

14:07.440 --> 14:13.120
 research. So I'm going to be doing a it actually be a trial. So 7,500 individuals will get BAM

14:13.120 --> 14:19.920
 linibimab, and we'll actually get more data. So really understand the timing, the safety profile,

14:19.920 --> 14:26.560
 and the efficacy of these therapeutics. So find out, you know, and look into this more and make

14:26.560 --> 14:30.160
 sure that this is something that if you feel like it's appropriate for your patients, you know how

14:30.160 --> 14:35.200
 to access the programs. All right, the early inflammatory phase, right? I've sort of skipped

14:35.200 --> 14:40.160
 right over the vaccines, but let me let me throw it in here before we get there. I mean, the whole

14:40.160 --> 14:45.280
 idea, right, is to keep people from even getting to this point. And the vaccine rollout has been

14:46.160 --> 14:52.160
 incredibly frustrating. I think that people have heard about this. You know, only 20 to 30% of

14:52.160 --> 14:56.720
 the vaccines that have been distributed have gotten in people's arms. It's having a conversation

14:56.720 --> 15:02.800
 with today about, you know, the latest sort of, I guess, instead of asking how can we help, it's,

15:02.800 --> 15:07.520
 we will punish you if you don't do a better job. I'm not sure that's helpful. We shared some of

15:07.520 --> 15:11.920
 the experience about when pro health received the vaccines, how basically by the end of the next

15:11.920 --> 15:17.920
 day, 90% of those were in people's arms. But I have to say, this was not easy. We were told that

15:17.920 --> 15:23.360
 eventually we were getting vaccines. The vaccines arrived. That's how I knew they were coming. No

15:23.360 --> 15:27.120
 one picked up a phone the day before to say they're in the mail. They'll be there tomorrow. They're

15:27.120 --> 15:31.760
 being shipped. I mean, I'm sure that will occurred. But it was really it was Tuesday, 1200 vaccines

15:31.760 --> 15:37.520
 just showed up. And then we were basically trying to get those in arms. You know, it was the week

15:37.520 --> 15:42.800
 after Christmas. A lot of people are on vacation. It's a challenge. You know, I think we need to

15:42.800 --> 15:48.400
 do a better job. We've really cut the departments of health out of the equation here. And this is

15:48.400 --> 15:53.280
 what they do. They were ready. They were ramped up and ready to go. So we need to do a better job

15:53.280 --> 15:58.480
 there. I'm just going to sort of leave that. But you know, if people are listening, you know,

15:58.480 --> 16:03.440
 we we all want to do a better job. The hospitals are not, you know, failing to vaccinate on purpose.

16:04.160 --> 16:08.240
 You know, instead of governors reaching out and saying we're going to find you, why don't they

16:08.240 --> 16:14.240
 reach out and say, how can we help make this happen? Are there HIPAA issues? Is there red tape in the

16:14.240 --> 16:19.040
 way? Are there, do you need, you know, issues you need help getting, you know, IT stuff uploaded?

16:19.040 --> 16:23.120
 What do you need? Let's make it happen. Because I'm sure there's some IT workers and other folks

16:23.120 --> 16:28.160
 out there who are ready to help just. So I'm sort of my request changed the paradigm if you can.

16:28.160 --> 16:33.520
 And maybe all our listeners can help push that forward. The early inflammatory phase,

16:33.520 --> 16:38.080
 I mentioned before, we're running out of oxygen. What do we have? Well, we do have remdesivir.

16:38.080 --> 16:42.480
 And a little subtle change here. I don't think any of us have gotten more and more excited about

16:42.480 --> 16:47.520
 efficacy. But there have been several studies now saying like you don't really have to worry

16:47.520 --> 16:52.240
 about renal function. This is being given to people with end stage real disease, people on

16:52.240 --> 16:57.840
 dialysis. It looks like it's safe in people with renal disease. It looks like it's tolerated in

16:57.840 --> 17:03.760
 people that have pretty significant LFT abnormalities up to 10 times upper limit of normal.

17:03.760 --> 17:09.760
 So at this point, I'm not saying we have any more efficacy data. I'm just saying that we can we

17:09.760 --> 17:16.640
 no longer have to not give it if there's a renal function issue or LFT issues. The other, and you

17:16.640 --> 17:22.960
 know, I'm going to tell people they should listen to a TWIB 703 Vincent. Because I think you did a

17:22.960 --> 17:27.920
 great job. The group did a great job. I was going to spend a little time talking about CT values,

17:27.920 --> 17:33.280
 and I'm just going to talk a little bit about CT values. Not all our hospitals, as I mentioned,

17:33.280 --> 17:37.120
 have access to this. Some of the machines don't give CT values. They just you know, you could

17:37.120 --> 17:41.920
 save a little money and buy a yes or no machine. But there were some interesting studies that

17:41.920 --> 17:47.520
 came out that were talked about. And one of the things is that someone comes in and timing again

17:47.520 --> 17:53.440
 matters. We're not looking at peak level of virus. We're saying seven days out, we're saying the time

17:53.440 --> 17:58.640
 at which someone de-compensates and someone shows up at the hospital if the people have a very high

17:58.640 --> 18:03.360
 level of virus at that point. And they have yet to mount an antibody response when they're sick

18:03.360 --> 18:09.040
 enough to require hospitalization. Those people are much more likely to die. And we're looking at

18:09.040 --> 18:17.520
 a patient today in the ICU who I do not expect to survive. You know, who came in with the PCR

18:17.520 --> 18:25.120
 positive. You know, it was into the second week, antibodies had not developed yet. These are people

18:25.120 --> 18:30.560
 that are not doing well. How does that help us clinically? I don't know if it does. I mean,

18:30.560 --> 18:34.320
 some of the things we've seen is that people that are going to do poorly tend to de-compensate

18:34.320 --> 18:39.200
 earlier. So some of my discussions were, well, it makes sense. The virus is still high because

18:39.200 --> 18:45.520
 they're coming in earlier. You come in at day 14. I expect a lower viral level. I also expect

18:45.520 --> 18:50.480
 there to be enough time for the antibodies to develop. So we'll learn more about that. But

18:50.480 --> 18:55.120
 this is potentially now that we're talking about CT values, something that's going to help us

18:55.120 --> 19:00.160
 on the tail end. You know, I do a lot of consulting enough. People know about this for the entertainment

19:00.160 --> 19:07.840
 industry and sports. And I had always been a zero tolerance. But now with CT values, we actually

19:07.840 --> 19:12.640
 had a discussion that if that if both CT values, right, because there's often two primers, that's

19:12.640 --> 19:19.040
 if both CT values are greater than 34, and the person has been well for more than, we'll say,

19:19.040 --> 19:24.560
 20 days to be conservative. I really think that that may actually be reasonable for us to start

19:24.560 --> 19:30.160
 looking at, well, at least for me to start loosening up my zero tolerance for some of those settings.

19:30.160 --> 19:34.080
 Secondary infection phase, you know, there was a there was a morning conference,

19:34.080 --> 19:37.760
 Tuesday morning conference at Columbia. And first, it was the pulmonologist. Then it was the

19:37.760 --> 19:43.360
 infectious disease physicians. And they were doing some case reports. And it was a discussion

19:43.360 --> 19:51.680
 about invasive pulmonary infections. So aspergillosis, that's one of our molds that we worry about.

19:51.680 --> 19:56.320
 And it's interesting. I've seen several studies and I always hate when they throw in, you know,

19:56.320 --> 20:02.880
 the word the judgmental word low or high. And there was a recent publication occurrence of

20:02.880 --> 20:09.040
 invasive pulmonary fungal infections in severe COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU. And they

20:09.040 --> 20:15.600
 said we have seen very few only 4.8% of our patients have a fungal infection. Well, one in 20, I'm not

20:15.600 --> 20:23.200
 sure I would say very few other series have suggested higher. We have not seen that many in

20:23.200 --> 20:29.040
 the hospitals where I have worked, we have seen some. But this just when you're in that secondary

20:29.040 --> 20:34.160
 infection phase, just not only we worried about bacterial infections, not only we've seen more

20:34.160 --> 20:39.760
 and more multi drug resistant bacterial infections. So you put them on what we thought was broad

20:39.760 --> 20:44.400
 spectrum antibiotics. And actually it's ineffective because of the rising rates from the antibiotic

20:44.400 --> 20:50.240
 overuse. But you also have to be thinking about fungal infections as well. So discussion about

20:50.240 --> 20:56.880
 sending off the fun to tell the Aspergillus galactamanin serum test as well as BAL

20:57.680 --> 21:03.040
 specimens to try to sort all this out. Got a very interesting call today, which hopefully I'll get

21:03.040 --> 21:09.440
 more development on going forward, but an individual at one of our local hospitals,

21:09.440 --> 21:17.120
 who sounds like he is being admitted with a multi system inflammatory syndrome in an adult

21:17.120 --> 21:22.720
 gentleman in his late 30s. I'm also concerned that this person may actually have a stronger

21:22.720 --> 21:27.680
 ladies hyper infection as well. So we'll get some interesting things there. But that's just

21:27.680 --> 21:34.000
 something that we see often people leave the hospital, and then they come back in week three

21:34.000 --> 21:39.920
 or four with just, you know, sky high ferritins, D dimers, massive amounts of inflammation.

21:40.720 --> 21:45.760
 And the challenge to sort out is this someone that you treat with IVIG and steroids,

21:45.760 --> 21:51.440
 or is this someone who has a massive infection? So there's sort of this overlap here. You want

21:51.440 --> 21:58.000
 to try to somehow make a really tough decision here. And we're working with the CDC and the

21:58.000 --> 22:03.520
 physicians there. So hopefully that'll end up with a positive outcome in this young gentleman.

22:03.520 --> 22:08.880
 The other thing that I want to close on is to talk about long COVID. And I make sure I always

22:08.880 --> 22:12.960
 talk about this. I've been doing that since I think about April. And there was a there was

22:12.960 --> 22:18.960
 a recent study cognitive deficits in people who have recovered from COVID-19 relative to controls.

22:18.960 --> 22:27.200
 And this looked at over 84,000 individuals. So what I really enjoyed about this is the fact that

22:27.200 --> 22:32.720
 you were able to see that the severity of disease was predictive of the severity of the cognitive

22:32.720 --> 22:40.400
 deficits, people who were sick enough that they ended up on a ventilator. The cognitive impact

22:40.400 --> 22:47.760
 in them was basically equivalent of about being 10 years older, having an IQ drop of about 8.5.

22:47.760 --> 22:54.640
 But on specific testing, you were seeing cognitive deficits, even in people that had mild

22:54.640 --> 23:00.080
 outpatient disease, not quite as severe. So the severity of your disease, whether or not you have

23:00.080 --> 23:06.720
 significant respiratory symptoms early on, significant amount of oxygen support, whether or not you're

23:06.720 --> 23:13.440
 ventilated. So the sicker you are, not only the higher likelihood you have of getting long-term

23:13.440 --> 23:21.520
 cognitive deficits, but also predictive of more severe cognitive deficits, a little more data on

23:21.520 --> 23:28.640
 the loss of taste and smell. We're actually seeing about 86% of people by six months are

23:28.640 --> 23:35.040
 getting their taste and smell back. That means about 14, 15% of people six months out still are

23:35.040 --> 23:39.760
 chewing on cardboard. So we'll end it there. I want to try to keep it a little short today.

23:39.760 --> 23:45.040
 And ask you to continue to come to parasites without borders and help us support the P-score,

23:45.040 --> 23:50.080
 their HIV and AIDS programs. I just want to point out, we're immersed in COVID, we're drowning in

23:50.080 --> 23:56.000
 COVID, but when we come out the other side of this, we have so many other issues and we're hoping to

23:56.000 --> 24:01.840
 be here to help educate and support all these other causes. All right, Dan, three quick questions.

24:01.840 --> 24:10.560
 One is from Dr. O'Brien who writes about your update on the use of Bambam. In the first week to

24:10.560 --> 24:15.840
 lower the incidence of hospitalization, when I reached out to our local hospital officials,

24:15.840 --> 24:20.000
 they seem to be limiting this treatment to very high-risk patients. Could you give us further

24:20.000 --> 24:25.200
 information about the specific criteria for emergency use of this drug? My staff members seem

24:25.200 --> 24:30.560
 quite sick at home, but do not meet the criteria set forth by the hospital. It seems to me that

24:30.560 --> 24:35.280
 Bambam might be beneficial in a much wider group of patients sick with COVID-19.

24:35.280 --> 24:41.600
 Yeah, so I shared this. This is like the vaccines. We've made it so hard to access things that no

24:41.600 --> 24:46.400
 one gets them, so they sit there on the shelf. Some of the hospitals, I'll say in Minnesota,

24:46.400 --> 24:50.640
 for instance, the experience I had there was that they're basically trying to give out as much

24:50.640 --> 24:57.200
 per day as is coming in, so it's not just sitting there. So they will first target the people that

24:57.200 --> 25:03.280
 are highest-risk, so that would be people who have a 10% or higher likelihood of ending up in the

25:03.280 --> 25:10.240
 hospital. So this would be individuals who are 65 and older, 55 plus a certain list of comorbidities.

25:10.240 --> 25:16.320
 There is a Bambalinibimab FDA-FACT sheet, which is available online to look at. I glance at it,

25:16.320 --> 25:22.800
 because the third category is very complicated. It's any of the following, and it's a long list

25:22.800 --> 25:28.960
 of severe diseases, which significantly increase your chance of ending up in the hospital.

25:30.000 --> 25:34.480
 So they go through that triage. I think it makes sense. I mean, this is a therapy that

25:35.120 --> 25:40.560
 the reason it has E-way for the 10% or higher risk of hospitalization is that's where it makes

25:40.560 --> 25:46.080
 sense. But it would seem to me, rather than letting it sit on the shelf, it is probably

25:46.080 --> 25:50.320
 beneficial in people beyond that group. And I've actually seen people outside of that group get

25:50.320 --> 25:54.640
 it very quickly bounce back quicker than we would expect with the natural history.

25:55.280 --> 25:59.520
 But then again, you know, as I started off with my evidence-based medicine,

25:59.520 --> 26:04.320
 that population was not specifically studied. So you're stretching it a little bit,

26:04.320 --> 26:09.440
 but it tends to be a very safe therapy. As we move forward with more studies,

26:09.440 --> 26:13.440
 hopefully the use of this will expand. All right. The next email is from

26:13.440 --> 26:20.560
 Allen, who writes about his wife who has severe asthma. And some years ago, in preparation for

26:20.560 --> 26:28.160
 a chest x-ray, she was given intravenous iodine contrast, and she went into anaphylactic shock.

26:28.160 --> 26:34.400
 And they had no idea that she was allergic to this contrast agent. So he asks, how are we

26:34.400 --> 26:37.840
 supposed to know if we were allergic to any of the ingredients in the vaccine? If there are a

26:37.840 --> 26:43.360
 bunch of compounds that we have no clue about, more specifically, are any also found in iodine

26:43.360 --> 26:51.280
 contrast? Yeah. So this is an excellent question. When the MMWR just came out with a recent

26:52.000 --> 27:00.800
 report on the side effects seen with the vaccines and reported about 1 in 100,000 people are having

27:00.800 --> 27:08.640
 an anaphylactic reaction. So that means 11.1 people and the first million that got vaccines.

27:08.640 --> 27:15.600
 These people were treated with beta drill, some of them received epinephrine, and then all recovered.

27:15.600 --> 27:24.720
 So this is not a vaccine that has zero risks. It is an effective agent. So there is this.

27:24.720 --> 27:31.360
 But who had those reactions? The initial recommendation, the current recommendation is someone who's had

27:31.360 --> 27:36.400
 a prior significant vaccine reaction, and that would be an anaphylactic reaction to a vaccine.

27:36.400 --> 27:41.680
 Someone you'd have heightened concerned about. It's not a food allergy. It's not an iodine

27:41.680 --> 27:48.000
 allergy. I'm doing a talk for an allergy group next week. There is a paper that came out that was

27:48.000 --> 27:56.320
 actually published by a group out of Harvard looking at PEG 2000, polyethylene glycol. The idea is

27:56.320 --> 28:03.680
 that maybe what is triggering these immune reactions, these anaphylactic reactions, and there is some

28:03.680 --> 28:08.720
 investigation into trying to figure out if there's some way to do maybe skin testing to figure out

28:08.720 --> 28:14.960
 who that 1 in 100,000 person is. I have to say the way I weigh in on this is the recommendation

28:14.960 --> 28:21.600
 is all the sites giving vaccine vaccinations should have a vaccination reaction kit,

28:21.600 --> 28:26.880
 which involves beta drill. The epinephrine, which was to have enough for three people

28:26.880 --> 28:35.360
 at each site, also intravenous formulations of the anhistamine as well as the oral and

28:35.360 --> 28:42.400
 femotidine, so intravenous other, sort of H2 blockers, and the ability basically to get

28:42.400 --> 28:47.360
 someone to a higher level of care as needed. We're talking about a million people vaccinated

28:47.360 --> 28:52.560
 10 reactions. It's actually quite uncommon, but you need to be ready for those because again,

28:52.560 --> 28:58.320
 if you have this reaction, you have this reaction. Our last question is from Laura who writes about

28:58.320 --> 29:03.840
 her 66-year-old mother who was recently updating her advanced medical directive and included a

29:03.840 --> 29:08.800
 note saying if she were to contract COVID-19, she does not want to be placed on a ventilator,

29:08.800 --> 29:13.360
 as she believes she would be unlikely to survive and regain the ability to live a full

29:13.360 --> 29:17.680
 independent life. I did a quick search to see if I could find any literature on long-term

29:17.680 --> 29:24.160
 outcomes for COVID-19 patients on ventilators and have found one study considering whether

29:24.160 --> 29:30.000
 patients would survive to discharge but no other endpoints. I'd appreciate your insights on longer-term

29:30.000 --> 29:35.280
 outcomes for ventilated patients, either from the literature or if research on the subject has not

29:35.280 --> 29:41.760
 been published, your impressions from your own patient population. Yeah, so our own patient

29:41.760 --> 29:48.800
 experiences were actually published. Early on, you saw data out of New York Presbyterian, so

29:48.800 --> 29:53.920
 Columbia, you saw data out of NYU, you saw data experienced at Northwell, so the different hospitals

29:53.920 --> 29:59.200
 where I see patients. The initial experience was that people who ended up on the ventilator,

29:59.200 --> 30:04.640
 the early experience was the last single-digit survival that they got up to 15% survival,

30:04.640 --> 30:13.200
 but consistently people who went up on ventilators have a very poor prognosis. They have a limited

30:13.200 --> 30:20.000
 chance of surviving, so it continues to be as much as possible to try to keep people off the

30:20.000 --> 30:24.720
 ventilators. Our experience, which I think is consistent with the literature, is once you get

30:24.720 --> 30:30.560
 on the ventilator, you're probably not going to survive. I say probably, but again, each individual

30:30.560 --> 30:36.080
 case, so people make these advanced directives, but you want to look at the whole picture. What's

30:36.080 --> 30:40.880
 the age in the individual? What are the comorbidities? Now we've talked a little bit about the ability

30:40.880 --> 30:46.640
 to look at viral levels and antibodies and inflammatory markers and neutrophil lymphocyte ratios,

30:46.640 --> 30:52.480
 so you can even make this more customized to an individual. That's potentially another way

30:52.480 --> 31:00.160
 to nuance it to look and talk to your mom's health care provider about specifically for her,

31:00.160 --> 31:06.640
 which is really what it is. At this age, maybe this is one of the people that would survive and

31:06.640 --> 31:10.800
 come off the ventilator, so you want to have those discussions to make sure that, as we say,

31:10.800 --> 31:17.680
 your goals of care are consistent with the treatments. Daniel, if you do survive after a ventilator,

31:17.680 --> 31:25.440
 do you have any long-term issues? In most cases, I think we're seeing yes. As I discussed today,

31:25.440 --> 31:32.880
 high incidence of about a 10-point IQ hit on average, you're seeing long-term disability.

31:33.920 --> 31:37.200
 People who survive, and I think this is really important for pillage matter,

31:37.200 --> 31:41.840
 just surviving COVID doesn't mean you bounce back to 100%. A lot of times, it means now you're going

31:41.840 --> 31:51.280
 to have significant mortality. That's COVID-19, clinical update number 44 with Dr. Daniel Griffin.

31:51.280 --> 31:56.000
 Thanks, Daniel. Oh, thank you so much. Thank you, everyone. If you can push,

31:56.000 --> 32:25.840
 help us get those vaccines into arms. Thank you so much.
