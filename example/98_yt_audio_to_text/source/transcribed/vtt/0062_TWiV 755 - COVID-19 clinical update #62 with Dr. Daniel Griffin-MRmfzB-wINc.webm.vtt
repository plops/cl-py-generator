 This week in virology, the podcast about viruses, the kind that make you sick.

00:10.400 --> 00:20.720
 From Microbe TV, this is Twiv, this week in virology, episode 755, recorded on May 13, 2021.

00:21.440 --> 00:27.920
 I'm Vincent Rackeniello, and you're listening to the podcast All About Viruses. Joining me today

00:27.920 --> 00:34.720
 from New York, Daniel Griffin. Hello, everyone. How's it going this week, Daniel?

00:36.560 --> 00:42.800
 It's mixed, right? Numbers are getting better in New York, right? We finally, the other day,

00:42.800 --> 00:49.840
 got below less than 2,000 people in hospital, which is quite, you know, imagine, at one point,

00:49.840 --> 00:54.720
 we had more than that dying per day, right? Now we're less than 2,000 in hospital.

00:54.720 --> 01:01.360
 So it's amazing the way our benchmark is changing. We're still seeing 20, 30, 40 people dying a day,

01:01.360 --> 01:08.800
 but that's not 2,000. Still had another one of my patients die last night, so we're still losing

01:08.800 --> 01:13.680
 people. Still, I mean, people die of COVID here. But I think people are seeing there's a change.

01:13.680 --> 01:18.560
 I mean, a lot of the hospitals are pointing out 99% of the people that are getting admitted

01:18.560 --> 01:24.080
 now are people that never got a vaccine. So that's what we're seeing. We're seeing people who would

01:24.080 --> 01:30.640
 rather take their chances not do well, right? This is the lottery that you lose. But let me start

01:30.640 --> 01:35.440
 off with our quotation, and then we'll go right into this. And I'm going to start with a quotation

01:35.440 --> 01:43.520
 from Nelson Mandela. There is no keener revelation of a society's soul than the way it treats its

01:43.520 --> 01:48.480
 children. So we're going to be talking actually quite a bit about children today. There's been a

01:48.480 --> 01:55.200
 lot of news about kids and masks. We'll try to hit on everything. And a lot of stuff is hot off the

01:55.200 --> 02:01.840
 press, right? So I was listening, I was listening to the latest Twiv right before this. I do listen

02:01.840 --> 02:08.000
 to all the other Twiv and Twix episodes, by the way. So there's some comment. If Daniel's listening,

02:08.000 --> 02:15.680
 I'm always listening, right? Like Dauchy on the couch or something. But let's start off with,

02:15.680 --> 02:19.840
 we won't get right to the hot news. We'll start with some background on May 6th,

02:19.840 --> 02:26.960
 Moderna reported. Phase two, three teen cove study of mRNA 1273 and adolescents.

02:27.680 --> 02:35.200
 The phase two, three study of mRNA 1273 and adolescents ages 12 to 17 completed enrollment

02:35.200 --> 02:44.320
 in the US. We got initial analysis here of 3235 participants, randomized two to one. And we're

02:44.320 --> 02:52.720
 seeing here vaccine efficacy of 96% in the zero negative participants who received at least one

02:52.720 --> 02:59.920
 injection, right? So the analysis included 12 cases starting 14 days after the first dose

02:59.920 --> 03:08.160
 and based on the CDC definition of COVID-19, which requires one COVID-19 symptom paired with a

03:08.160 --> 03:16.320
 nasopharyngeal swab or saliva sample positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. So just a little bit

03:16.320 --> 03:21.680
 more about this, right? Just to give this is the Moderna sort of balance to the data that

03:22.320 --> 03:26.160
 we're going to talk about with Pfizer, so we're going to talk about what Pfizer is now doing.

03:26.720 --> 03:33.680
 But in the study, the median duration for follow-up in this analysis was 35 days following the second

03:33.680 --> 03:40.560
 dose. The vaccine, the Moderna vaccine was very well tolerated in these adolescents.

03:41.360 --> 03:49.280
 Majority of the, say, adverse events were mild, moderate, no serious safety concerns. So what

03:49.280 --> 03:54.640
 are these things? Some side pain, right? It hurts to get poked with a needle. People did reconfirm

03:54.640 --> 04:05.040
 that. Fire is hot. They did also report headache, fatigue, muscle pain. There was some chills. So

04:05.040 --> 04:08.320
 the company reported that they're going to continue to collect the data here.

04:09.600 --> 04:16.640
 We can look forward to the Moderna vaccine in the future, also requesting expansion down

04:16.640 --> 04:20.960
 to cover adolescents if the rest of the data is in line with what we're seeing here.

04:20.960 --> 04:29.200
 What about kids younger? What about down to six months? There's also the kid cove study

04:29.920 --> 04:36.000
 of the Moderna vaccine in younger children. This is ongoing, and this actually is down to

04:36.000 --> 04:41.280
 six months of age. So this will cover those six months of age up to 11 years. That's ongoing.

04:42.240 --> 04:46.480
 Just to predict the future, you know, and this probably will not be Moderna first. It'll be

04:46.480 --> 04:52.400
 Pfizer, Moderna, et cetera. We're thinking we're not going to be expanding down to these younger

04:52.400 --> 04:57.920
 ages until probably September. But we'll see as we go forward with that.

04:57.920 --> 05:04.160
 Daniel, can I ask you? The numbers are very small. And we puzzled about that on Twiv.

05:05.280 --> 05:07.360
 Why are they so low for the adolescent studies?

05:08.320 --> 05:14.080
 Yeah. You know, there's a couple ways to look at this. One is we're just sort of slightly moving

05:14.080 --> 05:19.360
 moving the bar here. So normally we think of vaccine studies as being about 30,000 people,

05:19.360 --> 05:27.520
 minimum duration of two months. And so we've had now millions of people 16, 17, 18, just right

05:27.520 --> 05:32.160
 above here. So you're just sort of moving that down a little bit. And you're basically saying,

05:32.160 --> 05:37.040
 is there any sort of a different signal here? So this really builds on the 30 thought. You

05:37.040 --> 05:43.120
 couldn't do this by itself. You couldn't say, oh, I'm just going to do a, in this case, 3,235

05:43.120 --> 05:49.120
 participant study and get a vaccine licensed based on that. So it's really, this is data building

05:49.120 --> 05:53.040
 on the other data. And actually, no, that's, I'm glad you bring up because I get this question

05:53.040 --> 05:58.240
 all the time, parents say, like, but it's only like 3000 here, 2000 here, while I talk about 5,000

05:58.240 --> 06:03.120
 people in these studies so far. We're actually talking about millions of people. And we're just

06:03.120 --> 06:08.240
 moving moving that bar a little bit. You know, what is physiologically the difference between a 16

06:08.240 --> 06:13.600
 year old and a 15 year old, probably, as we're seeing not not very much, except boy,

06:14.160 --> 06:18.640
 this looks like an age when we get a really robust immune response. Is that good, Benson?

06:19.600 --> 06:24.560
 Try to see if there's more questions. Yeah, so I mean, you say millions, but the trial was,

06:24.560 --> 06:30.720
 you know, tens of thousands. So are we, are we following people who are being vaccinated in some

06:30.720 --> 06:36.400
 way? Yeah, so there's, there's two main ways that we're following people who've been vaccinated,

06:36.400 --> 06:43.280
 right? And I think Pfizer actually is the vaccine that has the most doses out there. Well, over 100

06:43.280 --> 06:48.720
 million here in the US alone. And there's two ways we follow that. So one is the VAERS, which is

06:48.720 --> 06:56.000
 sort of a passive anyone can report. But there's also active, we call phase four, where we continue

06:56.000 --> 07:01.680
 to follow a large cohort of these people who've been vaccinated. So it's a combination. The VAERS

07:01.680 --> 07:07.360
 is the broadest, right? And as we saw, even something as rare as with the clotting with JJ,

07:07.360 --> 07:13.680
 something that, you know, is maybe one in a million or so, maybe one in 100,000, we can pick that up.

07:13.680 --> 07:19.520
 So we have actually a tremendous amount of safety data in, you know, in the age group just right

07:19.520 --> 07:26.720
 above 15. So 16, 17, 18. Okay, great. Thank you. Transmission. You know, as I like to say,

07:26.720 --> 07:33.840
 COVID-19, most commonly spreads during close contact. COVID-19 can sometimes be spread by

07:33.840 --> 07:42.080
 airborne transmission. People seem very excited that that's been added. CD COVID-19 spreads less

07:42.080 --> 07:48.080
 commonly through contact with contaminated surfaces, right? And that was where it said maybe one in

07:48.080 --> 07:55.040
 every 10,000 case is due to contact. So we've really moved a lot away from the hygiene theater.

07:55.040 --> 08:03.600
 So this last week, I have to say the whole outdoor transmission topic heated up. This is a moving

08:03.600 --> 08:09.840
 target. And many are actually taking issue. I'm going to say appropriately. So with this number

08:09.840 --> 08:19.120
 that's being bandied about of less than 10%. Now, now, I for a while have quoted that your risk

08:19.120 --> 08:26.640
 of getting COVID outdoors versus indoor is about 20 times less likely outdoors, right? So when

08:26.640 --> 08:33.920
 that put us more down around less than 5%. Now, I want to say there isn't necessarily new science

08:33.920 --> 08:40.480
 here that everyone's getting sort of excited about. It's really rather a reaction to the updated CDC

08:40.480 --> 08:47.680
 camp guidance where masking outdoors is recommended as a baseline with certain exceptions. And we

08:47.680 --> 08:55.120
 talked about this CDC guidance that was updated by the CDC on April 24th. And what did they say?

08:55.120 --> 09:02.000
 What got sort of a strong reaction is they said all people in camp facilities should wear masks

09:02.000 --> 09:08.320
 at all times with exceptions. All right. So what are those exceptions? And we talked about this.

09:08.320 --> 09:13.120
 It could be the exceptions could be certain people or certain settings or activities.

09:13.120 --> 09:19.680
 Certain people, they said, children to and younger, a person with a disability who cannot safely

09:19.680 --> 09:25.440
 wear or remove a mask if necessary. Anyone who has trouble breathing is unconscious, right? So we're

09:25.440 --> 09:31.440
 we're saying certain people are exempted from this, but also certain settings and activities,

09:31.440 --> 09:38.400
 right? And so what are those? Eating, drinking, swimming, napping involved in activities that

09:38.400 --> 09:44.320
 could make your mask wet during high intensity activities where a mask would create difficulties

09:44.320 --> 09:50.560
 breathing. And now add to this vaccinated, right? So that that's going to bring us back to outdoor

09:50.560 --> 09:58.240
 transmission. But before we jump into that, breaking news, right here on Twiv. I don't know if you

09:58.240 --> 10:05.120
 heard this, Vincent, but today, Dr. Wilensky at the CDC announced in Thursday the day that we're

10:05.120 --> 10:13.600
 recording this episode that people fully vaccinated against COVID-19 do not need to wear masks or

10:13.600 --> 10:19.520
 practice social distancing indoors or outdoors, except under certain circumstances.

10:20.400 --> 10:26.320
 This was then echoed by Anthony Fauci. Now, there certainly are special considerations

10:26.320 --> 10:32.160
 if a person cannot mount an effective immune response to the vaccine. I was meeting with a

10:32.160 --> 10:39.280
 gentleman on Tuesday, 89 years old. He has an immunodeficiency where he has to get

10:39.280 --> 10:47.440
 intravenous immunoglobulins on a regular basis. He has some ongoing viral issues. Yeah, that's

10:47.440 --> 10:53.040
 not a man who's going to go to the ball game with his mask off or be in a large indoor setting

10:53.040 --> 11:00.800
 with his mask off. So this is certainly great news for people that have a healthy immune system,

11:00.800 --> 11:08.400
 people who can mount a proper response to the vaccines. I think that this is reasonable.

11:08.400 --> 11:14.960
 I think it's responsible. I think the science is now here and clear on just how incredible

11:14.960 --> 11:19.440
 protection a person gets when they're vaccinated. And I think this is going to challenge some of

11:19.440 --> 11:24.240
 the comments and concerns about quote unquote herd immunity or community immunity.

11:24.240 --> 11:31.280
 If you're vaccinated, right, we learn things that masks reduce risk by 80%. Maybe being outdoors

11:31.280 --> 11:39.200
 reduces risk by 95%. Your risk of ending up in the hospital or dying of COVID is reduced even more

11:39.200 --> 11:44.960
 most dramatically by vaccination. And I think that the science is now here. And I think as people,

11:44.960 --> 11:52.080
 you know, beat up the CDC a little, the CDC gives us evidence-based, reliable guidance.

11:52.080 --> 11:57.840
 And we've been thinking the science has been mounting. It's finally here and the CDC did not

11:57.840 --> 12:03.760
 wait and they stepped forward and endorsed these recommendations. But let's get back to outdoor

12:03.760 --> 12:09.920
 transmission. You know, as I said, this is not something new, but let's go through what the data

12:09.920 --> 12:17.440
 is when we hear this less than 10%. So back in November, there was a systematic review

12:17.440 --> 12:23.760
 published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases, outdoor transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and other

12:23.760 --> 12:30.480
 respiratory viruses, a systematic review. So these authors conducted a systematic review

12:30.480 --> 12:36.640
 of peer-reviewed papers indexed in PubMed, M-based and Web of Science, and freeprints

12:37.280 --> 12:44.880
 in Europe PMC through 12 August 2020 that described cases of human transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

12:44.880 --> 12:49.520
 Reports of other respiratory virus transmission were included for reference. Now,

12:50.080 --> 12:53.200
 I think it's getting nice when I listen to the other twibs that were getting back to

12:53.200 --> 12:58.240
 peer-reviewed literature. So hopefully in the future, all of these analysis will only include

12:58.240 --> 13:05.520
 peer-reviewed, properly-fetted research. But the authors here reported that based on five

13:05.520 --> 13:12.640
 identified studies, they found a low proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infections occurred outdoors. And

13:12.640 --> 13:20.400
 they say less than 10%. And then here's where you get that number. The odds of indoor transmission

13:20.400 --> 13:27.360
 were very high compared to outdoors 18.7 times, right? And they give a confidence interval to that.

13:27.360 --> 13:35.520
 So that's that I say 20, and I'm rounding 18.7 up to 20. Now, I will say, though, if you don't

13:35.520 --> 13:40.960
 just read the results, but if you actually go through this whole article, and this will be posted,

13:40.960 --> 13:45.760
 I think on parasites without borders so that you can actually do this and start looking at the

13:45.760 --> 13:53.360
 tables, you'll actually see there's two really large studies in this analysis. One that involved

13:53.360 --> 14:03.280
 10,926 cases and another that involved 7,322. And in those two large studies, the number was

14:03.280 --> 14:10.400
 actually less than 1%. So it is true that the risk is less than 10%, but based on the two

14:10.400 --> 14:16.720
 large studies that were included, it was less than one. Now, there was a small study with 103

14:16.720 --> 14:25.520
 work-related cases. In that study, they suggested maybe 5%. So I think it's important to look through

14:25.520 --> 14:32.400
 the data here. Yes, it is less than 10%. It may actually be less than 1%. So if you're outdoors,

14:32.400 --> 14:40.480
 you've probably reduced your risk by at least 95%. People get vaccinated as we're seeing really

14:40.480 --> 14:46.080
 goes down even farther. And that's what we're hearing from the CDC. So effective is vaccination

14:46.640 --> 14:51.920
 that it is even more effective than wearing a mask and being outdoors and protecting you.

14:52.640 --> 14:58.240
 So I think the evidence is really compelling that being vaccinated and outdoors without masks

14:58.240 --> 15:04.160
 is really low risk all around. And as the CDC is saying, boy, if you're vaccinated,

15:04.160 --> 15:10.560
 maybe being indoors is fine too. Now that vaccine eligibility has dropped to age 12,

15:11.440 --> 15:16.240
 this is really going to leave us a small donut hole for the summer going into this, right? The

15:16.240 --> 15:24.560
 kids age three to 11, you combine testing, drops in community prevalence, all the many exceptions

15:24.560 --> 15:29.760
 that are sort of built into when the masks can come off. I think we're really headed in a positive

15:29.760 --> 15:34.720
 direction here testing. Never miss an opportunity to test. There's been a little discussion,

15:35.280 --> 15:39.600
 and we're seeing it in our urgent care and primary care centers. People are embracing those tests

15:39.600 --> 15:44.640
 at home. I wish the price point was better. I mean, it would be wonderful if there was some way of,

15:44.640 --> 15:50.640
 you know, instead of these wide ranges that you're seeing, you know, if they were a dollar a test.

15:50.640 --> 15:56.160
 They look like they're about 1250 a test. Some people are charging 35 a test. I guess if you buy

15:56.160 --> 16:02.240
 them in bulk at 1000 at a time, you can get that, you know, lower price point. But we're actually

16:02.240 --> 16:07.120
 getting, you know, parents are now doing this at home. Their child wakes up, doesn't feel well.

16:07.920 --> 16:14.880
 They wake up, don't feel well. They do the test. Sometimes that test is positive. They come in for

16:14.880 --> 16:22.320
 advice for guidance. So I just think the access to tests is fantastic. But boy, get vaccinated,

16:22.320 --> 16:28.160
 and then you won't have to worry quite as much. All right, active vaccination. Never miss an

16:28.160 --> 16:34.160
 opportunity to vaccinate. This is the big news that I think everyone's waiting for. This week was

16:34.160 --> 16:42.880
 the FDA expansion of the EUA for Pfizer down to age 12. On Monday evening, May 10th, 6 p.m.

16:42.880 --> 16:48.480
 The FDA announced that they had expanded the emergency use authorization for the Pfizer

16:48.480 --> 16:56.240
 BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 COVID-19 caused by severe

16:56.240 --> 17:03.840
 acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus to SARS-CoV-2 to include adolescents 12 through 15 years of age.

17:04.880 --> 17:09.120
 I was very happy about the timing because I was going to peer on TV. I did appear on TV the

17:09.120 --> 17:14.960
 following morning at Tuesday AM, and I was going to discuss this expansion. So it was really good

17:14.960 --> 17:24.240
 timing that they squeezed that in there for me. Now, what did the FDA have to say about this decision?

17:24.800 --> 17:33.760
 And they actually said, so March 2020, March 1st, 2020 through April 30, 2021, approximately 1.5

17:33.760 --> 17:41.360
 million COVID-19 cases in individuals 11 to 17 years of age had been reported to the Centers for

17:41.360 --> 17:48.320
 Disease Control. The FDA has determined that Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine has met the

17:48.320 --> 17:55.680
 statutory criteria to amend the EUA and that the known and potential benefits of this vaccine

17:55.680 --> 18:01.760
 in individuals 12 years of age and older outweigh the known and potential risks supporting the

18:01.760 --> 18:08.960
 vaccine's use in this population. So we discussed the data on a prior TWIV. We discussed some data

18:08.960 --> 18:14.320
 today on Moderna, but in the past we discussed this study with over 2,000 participants. So the

18:14.320 --> 18:22.160
 available safety data to support the EUA and adolescents down to 12 included 2,260 participants

18:22.160 --> 18:27.600
 aged 12 through 15 enrolled in an ongoing, so it's ongoing to keep looking at these kids

18:27.600 --> 18:35.280
 randomized placebo control clinical trial in the United States. Of these 1,131 adolescents

18:35.280 --> 18:40.960
 who received the vaccine, they were followed for a minimum, right? It's got to do at least two

18:40.960 --> 18:47.600
 months, which they did. And in this analysis among participants without evidence of prior

18:47.600 --> 18:55.280
 infection with SARS-CoV-2, no cases of COVID-19 occurred, so 0, 100% protection.

18:55.280 --> 19:04.720
 Now, on Wednesday, the ACIP voted unanimously. I don't know why I still get emotional about this,

19:04.720 --> 19:08.880
 but I do. I mean, this was a huge, you know, actually brought a tear to my eye when I heard

19:08.880 --> 19:15.760
 not only the votes coming in, but the comments afterwards. But the committee unanimously voted

19:15.760 --> 19:21.920
 to recommend the Pfizer vaccine for adolescents 12 to 15, and there were really several important

19:21.920 --> 19:27.200
 comments. And it was really interesting to hear some of the comments post-vote. Now,

19:27.200 --> 19:31.280
 Aporva Mandavili at the New York Times did a really nice job of capturing the comments,

19:31.280 --> 19:34.720
 which I appreciate it. I was driving while I was listening, and I was trying to decide,

19:34.720 --> 19:40.720
 should I pull over and jot these things down? So, fortunately, they were actually put in print.

19:41.840 --> 19:46.880
 Grace, Dr. Grace Lee, a member of the committee and professor of pediatrics at Stanford University

19:46.880 --> 19:53.840
 commented that, sometimes we lose the importance of children and adolescents in the midst of pandemic.

19:53.840 --> 20:00.240
 There's such a focus on older adults in particular. Dr. Maldonado reinforced that

20:00.240 --> 20:06.960
 children may be at lower risk, but they are not at no risk. And she pointed out,

20:06.960 --> 20:11.920
 while children's risk of severe illness is low, compared with that of adults,

20:11.920 --> 20:19.040
 the coronavirus has infected more than 1.5 million children, sent more than 13,000 children

20:19.040 --> 20:24.800
 to hospitals more than our hospitals for flu and an average year, according to the data collected

20:24.800 --> 20:31.680
 by the CDC. There was a comment that it is currently, COVID-19, is currently one of the top 10 causes

20:31.680 --> 20:39.040
 of death in children since the pandemic began. And remember, this is with full lockdown, with

20:39.040 --> 20:45.280
 virtual schools, with in the last year, camps and all these other activities shut down.

20:46.000 --> 20:51.360
 I think it's really important to remember that these numbers were what we observed with a rather

20:51.360 --> 20:56.960
 draconian lockdown with school closures, virtual learning, masks, everything else, things that,

20:56.960 --> 21:00.880
 I remember last February, some of our health experts saying, this will never happen in America.

21:00.880 --> 21:05.840
 Well, it happened in America. And despite that, we still had this impact.

21:05.840 --> 21:10.960
 Another little bit of good news. I think this is great news that we're going to be expanding

21:10.960 --> 21:16.560
 this opportunity to get vaccinated down. I'll let everyone know, my 15-year-old son, Barnaby,

21:16.560 --> 21:22.160
 is scheduled Friday evening. So when this drops, he'll already have had his first vaccines. I'll

21:22.160 --> 21:28.320
 be able to give some updates, maybe we'll even post a picture if he's willing to check with my wife

21:28.320 --> 21:33.440
 first. But we learned about temperature stability. That's always a challenge with a lot of these

21:33.440 --> 21:36.960
 vaccines, particularly, right? We think about the Pfizer with these thermal shippers.

21:37.760 --> 21:42.240
 And we heard from Pfizer that they actually have an updated formulation, which may allow six months

21:42.240 --> 21:46.720
 in the fridge. Well, Moderna is always right there with them. And they recently announced

21:46.720 --> 21:52.400
 ongoing development data related to the current formulation that could support a three-month

21:52.400 --> 21:59.440
 refrigerated shelf life for the vaccine, and also alternative formats to facilitate easier

21:59.440 --> 22:04.960
 distribution to doctors' offices and other smaller settings. And I think this is critical,

22:04.960 --> 22:10.240
 and I've talked a little bit about this, is some people are happy to go to these sort of large

22:10.240 --> 22:17.680
 vaccination sites, the state-run sites. That's where Barnaby's going. But a lot of people want to

22:17.680 --> 22:22.080
 have that conversation with their physician, particularly a lot of parents want to have the

22:22.080 --> 22:25.840
 conversation with the pediatrician. What they've done here in New York State, and I think it's

22:25.840 --> 22:31.280
 really ingenious, is the Pfizer vaccines come with over 1,000 in this thermal shipper.

22:32.640 --> 22:39.040
 Not every pediatrician office is ready to accept 1,000 vaccines, and all the commitments of getting

22:39.040 --> 22:43.760
 them out. So there's sort of a cooperative that they've arranged, where several pediatrician groups

22:43.760 --> 22:49.200
 can work together to each accept a certain number of the vaccines. They get popped in a fridge,

22:49.200 --> 22:53.280
 you got five days, so basically, you're Monday through Friday to get those vaccines into arms.

22:53.280 --> 22:59.200
 So there'll be a little bit of flexibility and thinking outside the box to get this done so that

22:59.200 --> 23:03.520
 we get to that next level of people who want to have a conversation, want to ask questions.

23:03.520 --> 23:09.360
 I'm going to move to the viral symptom phase, right? The time for monitoring and monoclonals.

23:10.160 --> 23:18.320
 And we have some data on NSAIDs. So things like ibuprofen, napkin, and we have some reassuring data

23:18.320 --> 23:24.400
 on the ability to safely use the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen,

23:24.400 --> 23:31.360
 napkin, in COVID-19. And actually, I'd say this is huge. This may not seem huge, but

23:31.360 --> 23:37.360
 when a person is suffering through that viral symptomatic phase of COVID, or even starting to

23:37.360 --> 23:43.600
 move into the early inflammatory, it can be miserable. And it is amazing what an Aleve

23:43.600 --> 23:49.520
 anaperson, a couple ibuprofen can do, particularly the evening when that person is trying to get

23:49.520 --> 23:55.040
 some rest. So early on, people may remember, there was a little bit of concern as a letter sent.

23:55.760 --> 24:02.240
 But this article in the Lancet Rheumatology, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use and

24:02.240 --> 24:10.960
 outcomes of COVID-19 in the ISA-RIC clinical characterization protocol UK cohort, a matched

24:10.960 --> 24:18.800
 prospective cohort study. And so the authors reported on the results of this prospective

24:18.800 --> 24:24.720
 multicenter cohort study that included patients admitted to hospital with a confirmatory or highly

24:24.720 --> 24:32.240
 suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection between January 17th and August 10th, 2020. The primary outcome

24:32.240 --> 24:38.160
 was in hospital mortality. And secondary outcomes were disease severity at presentation, admission

24:38.160 --> 24:44.080
 to critical care, receipt of invasive ventilation, receipt of non-invasive ventilatory support,

24:44.080 --> 24:48.080
 use of supplementary oxygen, acute kidney injury. And now what did they find?

24:49.040 --> 24:57.600
 So this was a pretty robust study. They enrolled 78,674 patients across 255 health care facilities

24:57.600 --> 25:05.520
 in England, Scotland, and Wales where there be dragons. In this cohort, 4,211 patients were

25:05.520 --> 25:11.200
 recorded as taking systemic incense before admission to hospital. And they report that the

25:11.200 --> 25:17.360
 NSAID use was not associated with worse in hospital mortality, not associated with critical care

25:17.360 --> 25:22.400
 admission, not associated with the requirement for invasive ventilation, requirement for non-invasive

25:22.400 --> 25:31.360
 ventilation, requirement for oxygen, or kidney injury. So basically NSAID use is safe in COVID-19.

25:31.360 --> 25:36.800
 Passive vaccination. It actually looks like we're moving closer to full approval or licensure

25:37.440 --> 25:43.440
 here as the data is such that recently the FDA said that the data is currently so compelling

25:44.000 --> 25:49.360
 that they no longer agree with conducting placebo controlled trials here in the United States.

25:50.160 --> 25:55.440
 Basically, this is considered the standard of care and something that should be offered to

25:55.440 --> 26:02.720
 patients. A little bit of a challenge for the intramuscular, subcutaneous, and other monoclonal

26:02.720 --> 26:08.000
 antibody therapies that are trying to come to market, try to get their trials. We also have

26:08.880 --> 26:15.360
 ongoing trials looking at using these agents to protect contacts and high risk individuals

26:15.360 --> 26:20.480
 unable to produce their own antibodies. So things are moving with monoclonals. Actually,

26:20.480 --> 26:27.600
 it was at the gym today wearing a mask. I don't know if I need to anymore. This was before Dr.

26:27.600 --> 26:32.640
 Walensky made the pronouncement. We'll have to see when the rules change, but actually seeing

26:32.640 --> 26:39.040
 an advertisement on the television. So pretty exciting stuff that the information is getting out

26:39.040 --> 26:44.400
 there. We need to use these more. Now early inflammatory phase, if room air saturations are

26:44.400 --> 26:51.680
 less than 94%. That's when we have data that steroids dexamethasone from the recovery trial,

26:51.680 --> 26:58.080
 six milligrams once a day for 10 days improves outcomes and saves life. There are certain

26:58.080 --> 27:02.320
 situations where people are actually using little higher doses a little bit longer.

27:03.200 --> 27:08.000
 But here's where I want to throw in a little bit of caution here. People following the news about

27:08.000 --> 27:15.920
 India have probably heard about the black fungus or what is more properly called rhino-cerebral

27:15.920 --> 27:24.240
 mucor mycosis. And there was a nice case series published in the journal of laryngeology and

27:24.240 --> 27:32.800
 otology. And this was post coronavirus disease mucor mycosis, a deadly addition to the pandemic

27:32.800 --> 27:38.480
 spectrum. And I don't know if people are familiar with this. I actually have seen a number of cases

27:38.480 --> 27:43.840
 of this in my career and actually a number of cases when I was spending time in India.

27:44.480 --> 27:53.600
 Here the authors describe 23 cases and the association with diabetes overzealous use of steroids,

27:53.600 --> 28:00.320
 use of broad spectrum antibiotics, I'll add to treat a viral disease, and perhaps unclean oxygen

28:00.320 --> 28:07.440
 delivery devices. They have some great images in this article disturbing images. They're not

28:07.440 --> 28:13.280
 the actual looking and seeing in the open mouth of a patient that black s car, which is the fungus

28:13.280 --> 28:18.880
 eating away. But if you do, if you look inside the mouth, and I mentioned I spent some time in

28:18.880 --> 28:23.920
 Tamil Nadu where I saw some cases in the Indian population of this where you look inside the mouth

28:23.920 --> 28:28.640
 and on the roof of the mouth, there's this black s car where the fungus is basically eating away

28:28.640 --> 28:34.240
 the person's face and oral cavity. It's truly horrific. And I've even seen where it progresses

28:34.240 --> 28:40.720
 and eats away the eye. But this is really a caution. This is a viral disease. They do not need these

28:40.720 --> 28:46.800
 broad spectrum antibiotics. This steroids has somewhat of a benefit, but you do not keep these

28:46.800 --> 28:52.160
 patients on steroids for three weeks. You don't give steroids and let the glucosees go really high.

28:52.160 --> 28:58.480
 So where we're seeing a lot of this in India, this is really, we'll say iatrogenic, which means

28:58.480 --> 29:04.720
 we're causing this. So we need to be a little bit careful here, please. Remdesivir has some

29:04.720 --> 29:10.320
 minor impact at huge expense, I like to say. Anticoagulation for hospitalized patients.

29:11.680 --> 29:18.000
 The science strongly recommends against HCQ at this point. I apologize, but that's where we are.

29:18.000 --> 29:23.520
 There was a paper published in Nature Communications, mortality outcomes with hydroxychloroquine

29:23.520 --> 29:29.120
 and chloroquine in COVID-19 from an international collaborative meta-analysis of randomized trials.

29:29.920 --> 29:36.160
 And here the authors presented a meta-analysis of ongoing completed or discontinued randomized

29:36.160 --> 29:41.520
 control trials on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine treatment for any COVID-19 patients.

29:41.520 --> 29:49.200
 They reported on all-cause mortality, and they looked at publications, preprints. They even

29:49.200 --> 29:55.040
 reached out to the investigators to get more information if needed. Looking through 63 trials

29:55.040 --> 30:01.520
 were potentially eligible for inclusion. They include 14 unpublished trials with 1,308 patients,

30:02.160 --> 30:10.480
 14 publications, preprints with 9,011 patients. They included the recovery and the WHO solidarity

30:10.480 --> 30:19.520
 trials, which included 4,716 and 1,853 patients. Basically, just to say, the combined odds ratio

30:19.520 --> 30:27.840
 on all-cause mortality for hydroxychloroquine was 1.11 for chloroquine, 1.77. Basically,

30:27.840 --> 30:31.520
 they were reporting that treatment with hydroxychloroquine was associated with

30:31.520 --> 30:37.520
 increased mortality. So it looks like HCQ is associated with a 10% increase in mortality.

30:37.520 --> 30:45.440
 I think we need to move past that. Oxygen and pulmonary support, antibiotics are not helpful for

30:45.440 --> 30:50.560
 treating viral infections. And as I mentioned, the experience here can increase the risk of

30:50.560 --> 30:57.600
 kidney failure, progression to dialysis, death, and increase the risk of opportunistic infections,

30:58.160 --> 31:03.360
 which can harm or actually, in some cases, kill our patients. We mentioned last time some data,

31:03.360 --> 31:09.360
 tosyllismab added to steroids can improve outcomes and have a mortality benefit. Consider this

31:09.360 --> 31:13.840
 early in patients not reporting, not responding to steroids. It's not something you want to wait

31:13.840 --> 31:19.360
 to do. And this is something which has now actually been added to the ID society guidelines.

31:19.360 --> 31:26.720
 Tail phase long COVID post-COVID. So our listeners may have heard that Dr. John Brooks,

31:26.720 --> 31:32.880
 the chief medical officer for the CDC is COVID-19 responses. Let it be known that there will be

31:32.880 --> 31:39.040
 forthcoming guidance from the CDC on how healthcare providers can identify long COVID

31:39.040 --> 31:45.200
 and manage long COVID. And there will likely be a specific ICD-10 code, a diagnosed code

31:45.200 --> 31:49.600
 for long COVID. And I was asked for some input on the sky and said it really looks like they're

31:49.600 --> 31:55.760
 doing a great job recognizing that not all patients have access to testing during the acute phase

31:55.760 --> 32:01.600
 or test positive by serology when they come to medical attention. I expect that this guidance

32:01.600 --> 32:07.600
 will likely focus on the multidisciplinary team approach that many of our centers are finding so

32:07.600 --> 32:13.360
 critical for meeting the needs of these patients. I also think it's really nice that this is kind

32:13.360 --> 32:17.840
 of a new model. They're reaching out to some of these support groups. They're trying to get input

32:17.840 --> 32:26.480
 from patients. I know survivor core has been asked to basically input on this. So I really think that

32:26.480 --> 32:32.400
 this is going to be incredibly helpful for sharing the knowledge serving as an educational resource

32:33.280 --> 32:37.920
 for all the many clinicians who are really stepping up and helping take care of these patients.

32:37.920 --> 32:42.320
 Now I will finish by mentioning our fundraiser. So if you're not driving,

32:42.320 --> 32:46.960
 stop what you're doing. Go to parasiteswithoutporters.com and help us support

32:46.960 --> 32:51.680
 Foundation International Medical Relief of Children. This is an organization with sites

32:51.680 --> 32:57.280
 throughout the world and the patients they care for are struggling. The young volunteers who

32:57.280 --> 33:02.240
 usually go out to these sites, the financial support that they usually have to do all this

33:02.240 --> 33:07.040
 tremendous work. It's not there. And if you look at these places, they have a couple of sites in

33:07.040 --> 33:13.200
 India. They have sites in Sub-Saharan Africa, sites in South America. They have sites in so many of

33:13.200 --> 33:19.920
 these places that are being so hard hit with COVID. Please help us support them so that we can

33:19.920 --> 33:25.840
 really go beyond our borders and help address these global issues. All right, time for some

33:25.840 --> 33:32.480
 questions for Daniel. You can send yours to Daniel at microbe.tv. First is from Pete.

33:32.480 --> 33:37.440
 I have just sent money to a friend in India for oxygen, $500 for a cylinder,

33:37.440 --> 33:44.080
 $204 a fill that would probably help two people. I'm thinking monoclonal, monoclonals would be a

33:44.080 --> 33:50.720
 better option. Any idea how much and how to get them there? Yeah, so these are challenges. That's

33:50.720 --> 33:56.960
 amazing that that amount of money is being taken for cylinders and these other things. And really

33:56.960 --> 34:02.320
 frustrating that there was not better preparation for what's going on in India right now. I was

34:02.320 --> 34:09.600
 actually told by someone, I work with actually a lot of Indian clinicians and that Remdesivir,

34:09.600 --> 34:15.760
 for instance, was negotiated. So at least Remdesivir is only about $15 or $20 a dose in India. So

34:15.760 --> 34:21.840
 that's better than $3,000 for a course here in the United States. But access to the monoclonals

34:21.840 --> 34:26.480
 is difficult. There actually is a bit of a black market where the monoclonals, I don't know how

34:26.480 --> 34:31.600
 they're actually being initially procured, but they seem to be being sent over to India. So

34:32.560 --> 34:37.840
 I'm not going to endorse the black market. But yeah, when you start looking at these price points,

34:37.840 --> 34:44.080
 when someone's paying that amount of money for oxygen, then some of these other costs just

34:44.080 --> 34:49.440
 don't seem quite as high. So if anything, I think this just highlights what a tragedy is going on

34:49.440 --> 34:54.000
 over there. David writes, universities are starting to implement vaccine mandates for

34:54.000 --> 34:57.760
 their students. Since a lot of students come from overseas, the question keeps coming up,

34:57.760 --> 35:03.360
 what do we do about students vaccinated with non FDA approved vaccines, AstraZeneca,

35:03.360 --> 35:09.120
 Cinevax button, Covax and et cetera, revaccinate them seems kind of extreme given the existing

35:09.120 --> 35:14.960
 manufacturing shortages, except non FDA approved vaccines in the context of a mandate or just

35:14.960 --> 35:19.680
 some of them. Is there formal guidance? Obviously, there has to be a line drawn somewhere, but I'm

35:19.680 --> 35:27.360
 not sure who draws this line. Yeah, I've actually seen that the CDC is starting to put together a

35:27.360 --> 35:34.320
 guidance here. And what they are saying basically is if it's us FDA approved vaccines, all right,

35:34.320 --> 35:40.000
 that counts. But then you get into something like what about AstraZeneca. So that's the current

35:40.000 --> 35:45.600
 guidance. The current guidance, if somebody has vaccines that are FDA approved, considers effective,

35:46.320 --> 35:53.360
 then that can be considered as adequately fully vaccinated, the same criteria two weeks after

35:53.360 --> 35:59.040
 the last shot in the series. But so far, the rules are if a person got vaccines that our FDA

35:59.040 --> 36:04.880
 has not fully reviewed, has not fully endorsed or licensed or given an EUA, right, we're in the

36:04.880 --> 36:10.080
 world of EUAs, then we actually have to go ahead and revaccinate. And I think this is tough because

36:10.080 --> 36:14.240
 I'm going to say in the next sentence, we have an abundance of vaccines here in the United States,

36:14.240 --> 36:19.040
 we have the capability to do that. That's a little bit of an embarrassment, right, when

36:19.040 --> 36:24.480
 we're talking about places like India, where those vaccines would make a huge difference.

36:24.480 --> 36:30.000
 And what is the cheapest way to keep someone from dying from COVID-19, it's to vaccinate them.

36:30.000 --> 36:35.920
 Tiffany writes, I have a co-worker who has gout. She had a terrible flare up about a week after

36:35.920 --> 36:41.040
 getting her first vaccination. Is there any chance these events are connected? Her doctor told her

36:41.040 --> 36:46.560
 they probably are, but it seems weird to me. She found this article on podiatry today,

36:46.560 --> 36:49.760
 connecting gout attacks to vaccinations. I was just wondering what you think,

36:49.760 --> 36:55.840
 I don't want any more reasons for people not to get vaccinated if they aren't based on fact.

36:55.840 --> 37:01.440
 Yeah, so it would not surprise me, right? We often, well, as an infectious disease doctor,

37:01.440 --> 37:08.240
 we often see inflammatory triggers related to gout flares, right? And you can imagine how

37:08.240 --> 37:12.240
 bad that gout flare would be if you actually had COVID. And I've certainly seen patients who

37:12.240 --> 37:16.640
 come in with COVID. I've certainly seen patients that come in with pneumonia, urate tract infections.

37:17.360 --> 37:22.800
 You know, the gout is something that is driven by an inflammatory process,

37:23.360 --> 37:27.760
 and something like a vaccine potentially could trigger that. It very easily treated, right?

37:27.760 --> 37:33.040
 You treat it with ibuprofen or a leaf or a cultucine, right? We have many, many therapeutics for this.

37:34.160 --> 37:38.880
 And I think that we need to be honest, right? And this was something mentioned on the last

37:38.880 --> 37:43.120
 twist with is people get vaccines, they might have joint pain, they might have muscle pain.

37:43.920 --> 37:48.080
 It might be more than just that 24 hours. A colleague of mine actually had really bad

37:48.080 --> 37:53.920
 vertigo world spinning for several days after a vaccine. So there can be side effects. Why are

37:53.920 --> 37:59.040
 we recommending these products with these horrible side effects? It's because you know,

37:59.040 --> 38:03.840
 what's really horrible? Getting COVID-19. What's really horrible is dying of COVID-19. What's

38:03.840 --> 38:09.440
 really horrible is having a breathing to put down into your trachea because you've got COVID-19

38:09.440 --> 38:15.520
 and didn't get vaccinated. So we always talk about the risk benefits, boy, the risk and harmful

38:15.520 --> 38:19.840
 potentialities of not being vaccinated. That's why we're vaccinating everyone.

38:19.840 --> 38:24.320
 Lindsey writes, is there any evidence that people with a previous history of autoimmune platelet

38:24.320 --> 38:30.800
 disorders like immune or thrombotic thrombocytopenic perpera are at increased risk of CVST from an

38:30.800 --> 38:37.360
 adenovirus-vectored SARS-CoV-2 vaccine? Or if given one of those vaccines, should someone with such

38:37.360 --> 38:42.000
 a history be monitored for signs of CVST more closely than someone who didn't?

38:42.000 --> 38:46.080
 Yeah, you know, that's a great question, right? Because we sort of had this knee-jerk reaction

38:46.080 --> 38:49.920
 that, well, boy, if you've had a problem like that in the past, that, oh, you're someone who

38:49.920 --> 38:54.480
 should be at higher risk, we would think what has been shocking, right? We continue to track this,

38:54.480 --> 39:01.840
 right? We continue to see the rare CVST associated with JJ. I'm going to say that. I think there's

39:01.840 --> 39:06.880
 a connection there. I think we're all comfortable saying that rare as it continues to be.

39:07.760 --> 39:12.320
 But we are interesting enough not seeing this connection, not seeing it occur in people with

39:12.880 --> 39:17.040
 prior disorders, as you've described, even though that would have been the population we would think

39:17.040 --> 39:22.880
 about seeing it in. So no, this group is not at any higher risk. This continues to be incredibly

39:22.880 --> 39:29.280
 rare because it is so rare. Any intervention we might do is more likely to do harm than just watch

39:29.280 --> 39:34.480
 for waiting. All right, the last one, Daniel, we read on Twiv and we thought actually you should

39:34.480 --> 39:39.360
 answer it because we didn't have an answer. This is from Haley, who is a 26-year-old healthy

39:39.360 --> 39:46.080
 woman who got a Pfizer vaccine, both doses, got a lot of side effects, and many of them

39:46.080 --> 39:52.880
 lasting a long time. She now has daily headaches, muscle and joint pain, can't exercise. Her doctors

39:52.880 --> 39:59.360
 don't know what to do. She's regretting, having gotten the vaccine. She says, please help.

40:00.080 --> 40:05.360
 Yeah, I mean, I think this echoes what I was saying before, is that for not everyone, is it just,

40:05.360 --> 40:10.080
 oh, I felt bad for 24 hours, or I was sort of fortunate. I barely noticed that I was getting

40:10.080 --> 40:18.000
 my vaccination. Some individuals, like is being described here, can have risk or joint pain.

40:18.000 --> 40:24.080
 They can have muscle pain, and sometimes that can last for several weeks. We're usually recommending

40:24.080 --> 40:31.920
 that people take non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines for these, and this tends to last weeks.

40:31.920 --> 40:37.680
 We are not seeing so far, right, that this turns into anything long-term. I understand that the

40:37.680 --> 40:43.280
 frustration and the regret here. But if you are having difficulty, I mean, that's why we set up a

40:43.280 --> 40:47.600
 lot of these centers to try to help people. And as I think a lot of our listeners know,

40:47.600 --> 40:53.840
 I'm always happy to answer questions and to potentially step in and help in a situation like

40:53.840 --> 40:59.360
 this. So have your doctors reach out, and I'm happy to hopefully help guide you through this process.

40:59.360 --> 41:05.440
 That's COVID-19 clinical update number 62 with Dr. Daniel Griffin. Thank you, Daniel.

41:05.440 --> 41:12.240
 Oh, thank you so much. And everyone, be safe.
