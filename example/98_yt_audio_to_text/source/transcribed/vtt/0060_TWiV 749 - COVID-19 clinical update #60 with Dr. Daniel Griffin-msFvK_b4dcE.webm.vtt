 This week in virology, the podcast about viruses, the kind that make you sick.

00:10.400 --> 00:22.080
 From Microbe TV, this is Twiv, this week in virology, episode 749 recorded on April 29, 2021.

00:22.720 --> 00:28.640
 I'm Vincent Rackeniello, and you're listening to the podcast all about viruses. Joining me

00:28.640 --> 00:36.080
 today from New York, Daniel Griffin. Hello, everyone. How's this week been Daniel?

00:37.680 --> 00:41.280
 Things are getting a little bit better, to be honest, at least here in New York.

00:42.240 --> 00:47.360
 It's a little painful when I look at how things are going in the world, but let's get right into

00:47.360 --> 00:54.080
 it, because our quotation ties this together. There are two kinds of guilt, the kind that

00:54.080 --> 01:00.240
 drowns you until you're useless, and the kind that fires your soul to purpose. This is by

01:00.800 --> 01:07.760
 Sabah Tahir, a Pakistani American author. Right into that question, Vincent, that you asked me,

01:07.760 --> 01:13.040
 how are things going? Here in the United States, and most of the United States, we've really started

01:13.040 --> 01:19.760
 to come off of that plateau. Numbers are going down. We look at the numbers of patients in the

01:19.760 --> 01:25.600
 hospitals here in the New York state, and it's about 60 percent lower than it was a month ago,

01:25.600 --> 01:32.640
 so that's really coming down. It's often several days that I go without a patient with COVID

01:32.640 --> 01:39.120
 dying, actually. This is really changing the landscape. We are not where we were in April of

01:39.120 --> 01:46.160
 2020. We're in April of 2021, and it was just announced that July 1, New York City is going to

01:46.160 --> 01:55.040
 be full open 100 percent across the board. I think that we are seeing that vaccines are not

01:55.040 --> 01:59.680
 just tooled. They're the nuclear option. They really are our game changer, and we'll be talking

01:59.680 --> 02:07.040
 a little bit about that today. Things are not going well around the world. Around the world,

02:07.040 --> 02:13.280
 the cases are rising, the deaths are rising. We are still really in the middle of the pandemic.

02:13.280 --> 02:19.760
 This is why I sort of use this quotation as exciting as it is here in the US. I know

02:19.760 --> 02:24.960
 personally I feel a sort of sense of guilt, seeing how much other people are suffering,

02:26.160 --> 02:30.560
 and not wanting to say, let that make you feel useless. Let's all be asking ourselves,

02:30.560 --> 02:35.600
 what can we do to reach out now to the rest of the world now that I think we're really on our own

02:35.600 --> 02:43.760
 path here? Children and COVID. I mentioned, I promised last time that I would spend some time

02:44.480 --> 02:49.520
 talking about camp guidance, and we now have the CDC updated guidance for operating

02:49.520 --> 02:59.120
 youth and summer camps during COVID-19. You can Google away CDC, summer camp, and get this

02:59.120 --> 03:06.640
 really informative resource here. When I was younger, people don't know that I was once younger,

03:06.640 --> 03:11.840
 I was. My middle daughter, Eloise, actually, I think looks a bit like I did when I was younger,

03:11.840 --> 03:18.160
 except she's a lot better looking than I ever was. I used to work as a camp counselor at Camp

03:18.160 --> 03:25.360
 Jabberwocky. This was a camp out on one of the islands off the coast of Massachusetts for children

03:25.360 --> 03:33.280
 with cerebral palsy, spina bifida, down syndrome, other challenges. I look back on the time that

03:33.280 --> 03:40.080
 I spent there, and I think if we all take a moment, we realize how important camp is for so many

03:40.080 --> 03:44.960
 reasons, for so many different individuals, and to take an expression of my dad who says,

03:44.960 --> 03:50.480
 every vacation you don't take is a vacation you'll never take. Every summer, our kids don't have

03:50.480 --> 03:56.480
 an opportunity to go to summer camp. That's gone. That summer camp opportunity is gone. I've been

03:56.480 --> 04:02.400
 doing quite a bit pro bono work. I think I'm starting to push it with my wife. She's starting to say,

04:02.400 --> 04:08.320
 I need to stop doing so much of that. But I really think that this is a critical area, and so I've

04:08.320 --> 04:14.400
 been trying to do my part to help with a number of camps get set up for summer. But let's go through

04:14.400 --> 04:19.760
 what is the CDC telling us, and what can we think about for the summer for our children, for our

04:19.760 --> 04:26.000
 grandchildren, depending on where we are in life. So the CDC states that fewer children have gotten

04:26.000 --> 04:31.920
 sick with COVID-19 compared with adults during the pandemic. Children can be infected with the

04:31.920 --> 04:38.400
 virus that causes COVID-19. That's SARS-CoV-2. They can get sick with COVID-19. They can spread

04:38.400 --> 04:43.840
 the virus to others, and they can have severe outcomes. Now, I think this is an important

04:43.840 --> 04:50.240
 starting point. Children are at lower risk, but they are not at no risk. The CDC has a lot of

04:50.240 --> 04:54.720
 recommendations about how we are keeping our kids safe or how we can keep our kids safe.

04:54.720 --> 05:01.840
 They recommend that each camp have an emergency operations plan in place to protect the staff,

05:02.400 --> 05:08.080
 to protect the campers, the families, and then the communities. Remember, these camps operate in

05:08.080 --> 05:13.200
 areas which are often not as heavily populated as other parts. So if you bring COVID into these

05:13.200 --> 05:17.200
 areas, you're not just exposing the kids and everyone else, you're exposing the community.

05:17.200 --> 05:24.320
 There should be some minimum features in these plans. A lot of the camps, I have to say, are getting

05:24.320 --> 05:29.440
 these plans up. A lot of them are actually fully in place because probably expecting money from

05:29.440 --> 05:33.280
 the parents at this point. So they want to be able to have meetings. Actually, we had one last night

05:33.280 --> 05:39.440
 when Tila, well, after eight o'clock. First, we met ahead of time to go over our plans,

05:39.440 --> 05:44.880
 and then we spent over an hour with the parents answering questions. And so what are the topics

05:44.880 --> 05:51.280
 that should be in this emergency plan? One, and this is number one, the CDC is saying,

05:51.280 --> 05:57.840
 number one, strongly encourage vaccination for all eligible people. As I mentioned, this is a

05:57.840 --> 06:04.800
 game changer. We are seeing that the vaccines are more effective in real life than even we were

06:04.800 --> 06:12.880
 hoping when we saw the initial exciting studies. The other health screening for symptoms and

06:13.440 --> 06:19.600
 diagnostic or screening testing. So testing should be a part of the plan. That's number two right

06:19.600 --> 06:26.800
 after vaccine testing. And maybe we'll get into this a little more, but the government is working

06:26.800 --> 06:34.800
 with the states and providing testing opportunities for the camps, actually supplying testing in that

06:34.800 --> 06:41.040
 huge $2 trillion bill that went through, use multiple layers prevention strategies. So

06:41.040 --> 06:44.960
 we're still going to see masking in certain situations. We're still going to see physical

06:44.960 --> 06:49.920
 distancing. We're going to see cohorting and cohorting is a nice way to break this down

06:49.920 --> 06:55.760
 so that if there is an issue, it's not the entire camp. You're keeping it, you're keeping it sort

06:55.760 --> 07:01.840
 of contained. And then also a focus on the housing arrangements. And, and I think it's great,

07:01.840 --> 07:07.440
 right up front, improved ventilation. I think we've been trying to talk about the fact that,

07:07.440 --> 07:12.000
 you know, even though this is a respiratory droplet spread or respiratory virus,

07:12.000 --> 07:16.960
 if you take an indoor space, if you don't have ventilation, you start building up,

07:16.960 --> 07:21.840
 you start building up that six feet away is not going to protect you in an area with poor ventilation.

07:21.840 --> 07:28.000
 Think about kids sleeping together in these cabins with their staff. They also want you to start

07:28.000 --> 07:34.000
 thinking about the fact that not everyone's risk is the same. So think about campers and staff

07:34.000 --> 07:41.280
 that might have higher risks. Really a big push to promote outdoors. I kind of like this,

07:41.280 --> 07:46.400
 spending about 20 years of my life out in Colorado to see that, you know, the CDC now is recommending,

07:46.400 --> 07:53.360
 you know, promoting outdoor and lower risk activities. So, you know, I know people love

07:53.360 --> 07:58.800
 that that's singing in the mess hall. Let's get that singing outdoors. Traveling to and from,

07:58.800 --> 08:03.040
 you want to be thinking about that, you don't want to be creating exposure events on the way

08:03.040 --> 08:07.920
 to the camp. You also want to think about on the way off cleaning. They mentioned, right,

08:07.920 --> 08:11.680
 we're getting sort of down here. Remember, cleaning was number one in the olden days,

08:11.680 --> 08:17.280
 we're realizing this is not, this is something you get by breathing, not necessarily touching,

08:17.280 --> 08:22.880
 washing those hands. And then they go on to basically go through a lot of other things,

08:22.880 --> 08:29.520
 including where they finish with, have a plan in case someone gets COVID-19, have a plan

08:30.240 --> 08:35.440
 in case someone tests positive. And there's two sides, I'm going to say, if you get a positive

08:35.440 --> 08:40.160
 test, if you're doing a lot of testing, you're going to get false positive. So have a plan,

08:40.160 --> 08:45.840
 how do I quickly verify to see if this is true? How do I respond to those? So we're getting

08:45.840 --> 08:51.760
 great guidance here from the CDC on how to do this safely. We will have a layer where the states

08:51.760 --> 08:56.640
 are going to have individual guidance and actually mandates for how camps are going to operate.

08:56.640 --> 09:00.800
 They're going to give us specific numbers on if you're cohorting how big of those cohorts

09:00.800 --> 09:05.920
 allowed to be, what should be the ratio. So I think that's going to help here. But I think the

09:05.920 --> 09:11.920
 message here is that we can do this safely. Again, just like the schools, it can also be done

09:11.920 --> 09:18.480
 unsafely. So ask, ask your camp, what are your plans? Are you planning on following CDC guidance?

09:18.480 --> 09:22.880
 Are you planning on keeping my kids safe? Because as I keep re-array,

09:22.880 --> 09:28.160
 children are certainly at lower risk, but they're not at no risk. Pre-exposure period,

09:28.880 --> 09:34.640
 this has been an exciting week. CDC has really been out there this week. And on April 27,

09:34.640 --> 09:40.640
 the CDC came out with it. When you've been fully vaccinated, how to protect yourself and others

09:40.640 --> 09:45.280
 guidance. And I'm actually going to be, well, I think by the time this drops, I'll already talked

09:45.280 --> 09:52.000
 about this on the news, this fear of normal. How do we get back to normal and how can this happen?

09:52.800 --> 09:59.600
 So what did the CDC have to say? The first, let's define what does it mean as per the CDC

09:59.600 --> 10:02.960
 to be fully vaccinated? And they're using, just to keep it simple,

10:02.960 --> 10:08.400
 two weeks. They're saying two weeks after you finish your vaccine. So two weeks after you did

10:08.400 --> 10:14.720
 that, two dose Moderna Pfizer, two weeks after your J&J. People have probably known, I kind of

10:14.720 --> 10:20.400
 like four weeks after the J&J, but I won't break rags with the CDC on this one. But this is not

10:20.400 --> 10:25.600
 the day. This is not the night of your vaccine. Vaccines take a little time. So take that time,

10:26.240 --> 10:31.840
 let your body build up those T cells, those B cells, that immune protection. And then,

10:31.840 --> 10:38.320
 what can you do if you're fully vaccinated? As per the CDC, they're saying you can gather indoors

10:38.880 --> 10:44.240
 with fully vaccinated people without wearing a mask. That's pretty exciting.

10:45.440 --> 10:51.520
 You can gather indoors with unvaccinated people. And they're saying without masks,

10:51.520 --> 10:57.360
 they're talking about staying six feet apart. And they're also throwing in here, you want to be

10:57.360 --> 11:02.400
 careful if there's someone there who has increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19. Then,

11:02.400 --> 11:07.680
 and I like this part, you can gather or conduct activities outdoors without wearing a mask,

11:08.480 --> 11:14.560
 except in certain crowded settings and venues. So really doubling down on what we've learned.

11:15.280 --> 11:21.680
 If you are vaccinated, you are at much lower risk. If you're outdoors, that risk is about 20

11:21.680 --> 11:29.280
 fold higher than indoors. So we're starting to see things coming back. If you travel in the United

11:29.280 --> 11:34.960
 States, as per the CDC, you do not need to get tested before or after travel or self quarantine.

11:34.960 --> 11:40.720
 Remember, this is for the fully vaccinated. They do make some comments about international travel.

11:41.440 --> 11:46.240
 Really, the US isn't going to put a lot of onus on you. You're going to be needing to look at what

11:46.240 --> 11:53.440
 international destination you might be traveling to. What should you keep doing for now if you're

11:53.440 --> 11:59.520
 fully vaccinated, right? I think there was a wonderful beer commercial where the guy is all

11:59.520 --> 12:04.080
 excited. He's getting his vaccine and then he's going to go to the bar and do all these other

12:04.080 --> 12:09.440
 things. Well, what do they want you to keep doing? They say you should still protect yourself and

12:09.440 --> 12:16.400
 others in many situations by wearing a mask that fits snuggly. So let's say you're indoor,

12:17.280 --> 12:23.520
 public setting. There's a large number of people. There's going to be unvaccinated people,

12:23.520 --> 12:29.360
 including children, they point out from multiple households. So you're really still you're still

12:29.360 --> 12:35.120
 going to be wearing your mask in certain circumstances. You're visiting indoors with an unvaccinated

12:35.120 --> 12:40.720
 individual who's at increased risk. We're saying, boy, vaccination really makes you

12:40.720 --> 12:46.320
 much lower risk of transmitting to others. It does not make you no risk. And in this case,

12:46.320 --> 12:53.360
 if the stakes are high, they say you should still be avoiding those indoor, large gatherings. You

12:53.360 --> 12:58.480
 you don't want to go to that packed facility yet. At some point, maybe that will come.

12:58.480 --> 13:05.520
 And also, as we know, they still have a mask requirement if you travel. So even if you're fully

13:05.520 --> 13:10.560
 vaccinated, you're still required to wear a mask when you're on a plane, on a bus, on a train,

13:11.360 --> 13:18.080
 other other public transportation. They still want you to watch out for symptoms. As we've seen,

13:18.080 --> 13:24.720
 we do see breakthrough symptoms. Fully vaccinated people can still get COVID-19.

13:24.720 --> 13:28.800
 So if you have symptoms, you're still going to go. Don't stop testing. You're still going to go

13:28.800 --> 13:33.200
 get tested. And so I encourage everyone to go to the CDC site really look through this.

13:34.080 --> 13:38.000
 For some people, it's going to take a little time. I think other people just jump in the deep

13:38.000 --> 13:44.080
 end of the pool and they're good to go. I for one, I will mention I have a little trepidation. I

13:44.080 --> 13:49.120
 still have a fear of normal. It's going to take me a little time to ease back into things even

13:49.120 --> 13:55.120
 though I am fully vaccinated. Transmission. I always like to have a section where I push people's

13:55.120 --> 14:02.400
 buttons and get some criticism. So this will be it. In many ways, I think going through the camp

14:02.400 --> 14:08.320
 and the vaccinated guidance really helps us to answer a lot of the questions about transmission.

14:08.320 --> 14:14.160
 People are not, I think, as focused on the words as they are in really understanding

14:14.160 --> 14:19.840
 different circumstances and how to behave and how to be safe in those situations.

14:20.560 --> 14:25.520
 And I actually step out here and say, I think there was a disservice done early on

14:25.520 --> 14:32.640
 with the whole, is it airborne discussion? And perhaps the immortal words of Roxanne Comse,

14:32.640 --> 14:36.400
 maybe these will now become immortal. A headline of one of her pieces,

14:36.400 --> 14:42.160
 they say coronavirus isn't airborne, but it's definitely borne by air. The word airborne means

14:42.160 --> 14:45.760
 different things to different scientists and that confusion needs to be addressed.

14:46.800 --> 14:52.960
 Just I always like to sort of bring this back around again. Surfaces are low risk. Remember,

14:52.960 --> 15:00.240
 lots of hygiene theater, way too much bleach. Maybe one in every 10,000 cases came from surfaces.

15:00.880 --> 15:08.400
 Outdoors much safer than indoors. About 20-fold safer. Masks are effective for the wearer and

15:08.400 --> 15:16.080
 those around us. Air exchange is critical for indoor risk. Time matters and it is cumulative

15:16.080 --> 15:21.280
 for exposures. Vaccines are not just tools, as we're seeing. They are really the nuclear option for

15:21.280 --> 15:26.080
 ending the pandemic. And once people are fully vaccinated, once we get a larger percentage

15:26.080 --> 15:31.680
 of our population fully vaccinated, things do change. Things do really change in a positive way.

15:31.680 --> 15:40.000
 All right, testing. Never miss an opportunity to test. As we talked about the camps, as you saw,

15:40.000 --> 15:46.560
 number two right after vaccination was testing. So I want to keep reinforcing. We've seen a lot

15:46.560 --> 15:53.920
 of publications on this. I had one out there with some of my colleagues at UHG. And testing

15:53.920 --> 16:00.320
 is a critical part of this multi-layered approach to opening camps, schools, businesses, and other

16:00.320 --> 16:06.400
 venues. We should be doing more not less testing. We are doing less testing, to be honest. The data

16:06.400 --> 16:12.400
 is really compelling here. And one of the things that is compelling is we want more frequent,

16:12.400 --> 16:17.600
 so frequent testing. Rapid results. We want to avoid those resulting delays.

16:18.480 --> 16:26.240
 Test with testing, more is better. All right, active vaccination. This has been a busy area.

16:26.240 --> 16:31.600
 Never miss an opportunity to vaccinate and never waste a vaccine dose. We're starting to get to

16:31.600 --> 16:36.640
 the point here in the U.S. It's like throwing away food, right? Don't throw that dose in the

16:36.640 --> 16:41.520
 trash. Let's get it in someone's arm. We've definitely shifted here in the U.S. And I'm seeing

16:41.520 --> 16:47.360
 this firsthand from arms searching for vaccines to vaccines searching for arms.

16:47.360 --> 16:55.120
 Since we last talked, actually, this dropped after the meeting. But what happened with the

16:55.120 --> 17:02.160
 J&J vaccine? There was a meeting Friday, April 23rd. I asked my partners to cover so I could

17:02.160 --> 17:07.120
 listen to this. That just raises my geek factor, I guess, that I wanted to listen to this all day.

17:08.400 --> 17:16.960
 But a summary came out. So we saw published April 27th in the MMWR updated recommendations

17:16.960 --> 17:22.480
 from the advisory committee on immunization practices for the use of the Janssen Johnson

17:22.480 --> 17:29.280
 and Johnson COVID-19 vaccine after ports of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome

17:29.280 --> 17:36.000
 among vaccine recipients United States April 2021. So in brief, the advisory committee on

17:36.000 --> 17:42.320
 immunization practices concluded that the risks of resuming Janssen COVID-19 vaccination among

17:42.320 --> 17:49.360
 persons aged equal to or greater than 18 outweighed the risks and reaffirmed its interim recommendation

17:49.360 --> 17:56.240
 under the FDA's emergency use authorization, but included a new warning for rare clotting

17:56.240 --> 18:04.800
 events among women aged 18 to 49 for this thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome or TTS,

18:04.800 --> 18:09.600
 as we'll be referring to it, or as other people refer to it as VITS vaccine induced

18:09.600 --> 18:15.760
 thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome. So what did we know? What did we learn from this

18:15.760 --> 18:23.600
 publication and from the meeting? Nearly 8 million. So 7.98 million doses of the Janssen COVID-19

18:23.600 --> 18:30.240
 vaccine had been administered in the United States and the vaccine adverse event reporting

18:30.240 --> 18:39.200
 system. So VAERS received at the end of this prior to this meeting 15 reports of the TTS after

18:39.200 --> 18:45.840
 vaccinations. With the clots located, I think this is important in the cerebral venous sinuses

18:45.840 --> 18:52.240
 and other unusual locations, including the portal vein, the splenic vein, and a combination of

18:52.240 --> 18:59.760
 venous and arterial thrombosis. These 15 reports were confirmed by physician reviewers at the CDC

18:59.760 --> 19:05.520
 and the FDA. They went through and reviewed this, including having hematologists involved in the

19:05.520 --> 19:13.760
 review. 13 of the cases occurred among women aged 18 to 49. Two occurred among women aged

19:14.720 --> 19:20.640
 50 or older. And no cases post authorization reported among men. Remember, there was a man

19:20.640 --> 19:29.680
 in the trial, but he was not in this 15 person study here. So the TTS reporting rates were

19:29.680 --> 19:37.280
 7 cases per million. And the Janssen COVID-19 vaccines were administered to the 18 to 49.

19:37.280 --> 19:43.040
 We had 0.9 per million in the aged greater than 50 years. And then they broke it down into

19:43.040 --> 19:47.120
 different subgroups, which I'll go through actually. And what I'm going to do here is I'm going to

19:47.120 --> 19:52.720
 jump to, I'm going to give John hit some credit here. John hit at United Health Group actually

19:52.720 --> 19:58.640
 made some tables for me. Wasn't really for me there for the whole group, our sort of national

19:58.640 --> 20:06.160
 vaccine advisory panel. But what were the race? What were the cases of TTS per million vaccinations

20:06.160 --> 20:13.600
 broken down by age, right? So all age groups, 1.87. If you looked at people under 50, it was 7

20:13.600 --> 20:19.440
 per million, over 50, it was 0.9. And then you can break it down into other age groups as well.

20:20.000 --> 20:25.520
 Then there was the other and this came up where there are certain comorbid conditions or maybe

20:25.520 --> 20:32.800
 certain medications that we should be thinking about. What about obesity? 7 of the 12 had obesity,

20:32.800 --> 20:42.000
 8 did not. What about oral contraception? 13 were not, hypothyroid to hypertension to

20:42.640 --> 20:48.240
 no recent pregnancies. Interesting enough, no history of prior clotting disorders in this

20:48.240 --> 20:54.240
 population. So at the end of the report, and I'm going to sort of even make some comments here,

20:54.240 --> 20:58.160
 they basically went ahead and they said, okay, we are going to put this back out there.

20:58.160 --> 21:02.640
 We're going to put a warning on there and we're going to allow this to be a patient decision

21:02.640 --> 21:07.360
 ultimately. And I have to admit, when I've talked to a lot of physicians about this,

21:07.360 --> 21:13.280
 not all of them were as excited as I should say I was. And I think this is interesting, right?

21:14.080 --> 21:20.480
 Physicians like to be the ones who get to make decisions. And so here, we're basically saying

21:20.480 --> 21:25.920
 no, the patient will get the right certain physicians say I would feel better if we did not use this

21:25.920 --> 21:32.320
 vaccine in women under the age of 50. And I think that really take it as it is. They are saying

21:32.320 --> 21:36.960
 that's not the physician's decision. Here are the facts, it's the patient's decision. And we're

21:36.960 --> 21:41.600
 actually maybe starting to move into a realm where before we said take whatever vaccine you have

21:41.600 --> 21:46.400
 the opportunity to take. Now we're starting to see patients have preferences based on certain

21:46.400 --> 21:53.280
 things patient the other day. This was a woman in her 40s. She had a prior history of a pulmonary

21:53.280 --> 21:58.080
 embolism. We had a discussion and she was suggested to me that she would prefer to do a

21:58.080 --> 22:04.400
 Moderna over the J and J vaccine. I think that that's completely reasonable. If we're looking at

22:04.400 --> 22:10.000
 challenges with getting more vaccine uptake, giving people choice, letting them have agency,

22:10.000 --> 22:14.640
 I think that that's more important than physicians getting to have the final say on everything here.

22:14.640 --> 22:19.040
 We continue to have our vaccines against the variants race or what I like to call

22:19.040 --> 22:23.360
 vaccines against the variants of concern as well as behaviors of concern.

22:24.240 --> 22:29.840
 And we actually got to what I think are encouraging preprints that became available about the New

22:29.840 --> 22:39.840
 York variant. It's nice that we have our own variant. B1526 SARS-CoV-2 variant identified in New York

22:39.840 --> 22:46.160
 City neutralized by vaccine elicited and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. And that

22:46.160 --> 22:54.480
 was available as a preprint. We also had detection and characterization of the SARS-CoV-2 lineage,

22:54.480 --> 23:02.240
 B1526 in New York. Now basically both papers demonstrated that vaccine serum showed a little

23:02.240 --> 23:08.880
 bit of a decrease, but remained at an elevated and protective level. Convalescent plasma did not

23:08.880 --> 23:14.960
 fare as well. The monoclonal cocktail by Regeneron continued to be effective. I think the take home

23:14.960 --> 23:22.320
 message here was that the vaccine still work against the variants. Don't count on protection

23:22.320 --> 23:27.360
 after natural infection quite as much as counting on the protection that we get with vaccination.

23:28.560 --> 23:33.200
 All right, the period of detectable viral replication, right, you test positive.

23:33.200 --> 23:41.840
 This is the time for monitoring and monoclonals so far. I think it's important that although this

23:41.840 --> 23:48.880
 may not impact our daily clinician as physicians, we do pay attention to what's happening around

23:48.880 --> 23:53.280
 the world. Maybe it will swing back. Maybe it will affect us, but I think it's also important for

23:53.280 --> 24:01.760
 us to be aware of what's going on. So there was an article, the global case fatality rate of COVID-19

24:01.760 --> 24:07.760
 has been declining since May 2020 published in the American Society of Tropical Medicine and

24:07.760 --> 24:15.680
 Hygiene Journal. So what's happening here? So the authors collected daily COVID-19 diagnoses

24:15.680 --> 24:23.040
 and mortality data from the WHO's daily situation reports and reported that based on this data,

24:23.040 --> 24:32.080
 the weekly global cumulative COVID-19 reported case fatality rate. So that's that R-CFR. I feel

24:32.080 --> 24:37.760
 like we're going back when we were first learning about the difference between case fatality rate

24:37.760 --> 24:44.560
 and reported case fatality rate. So these are cases reported. We have documented that this is

24:44.560 --> 24:51.360
 COVID-19. What percent of those individuals die? We know that the actual case fatality rate is

24:51.360 --> 24:58.000
 probably higher, where the actual infection fatality rate is probably higher. But we reached a peak of

24:58.000 --> 25:07.280
 7.23% in the last week of April, April 22 to 28 in 2020, right? So it's right about a year ago.

25:07.280 --> 25:15.520
 This was followed by a strong declining trend up until the 53rd week post peak right after this peak.

25:15.520 --> 25:24.880
 We ended up down at 2.2% in the last week of December 2020. Now why did this happen? And they had a

25:24.880 --> 25:31.760
 couple suggestions, right? So that's the data. They suggested that part of this was an increased rate

25:31.760 --> 25:37.280
 of infection in younger individuals, right? We know the younger individuals have a lower case

25:37.280 --> 25:46.640
 fatality rate. They also looked at a map of regional reported case fatality rates. So Yemen,

25:46.640 --> 25:51.840
 for instance, where I believe Dixon likes to go salmon fishing, they had a reported case fatality

25:51.840 --> 26:00.240
 rate of 30% April through December of 2020, while by comparison, the reported case fatality rate

26:00.240 --> 26:06.480
 overall in the US is 2% for all cases with an outcome. So I recommend people take a look.

26:06.480 --> 26:10.240
 It's worth looking at the different figures and seeing what's happened over time.

26:10.240 --> 26:15.280
 I keep saying this is the time for monitoring and monoclonals, but I am hoping that this will

26:15.280 --> 26:21.440
 change. We keep hearing from Pfizer that by the end of the year, they're promising us an oral

26:21.440 --> 26:29.280
 COVID pill. Now, what do we know about this? They're talking about a phase one study of a very catchy

26:29.280 --> 26:38.800
 PF07321332. So what is this? And what do we know? A little background here. So SARS-CoV-2

26:39.360 --> 26:46.160
 produces two large viral poly proteins. These are really long proteins that are going to need to

26:46.160 --> 26:55.680
 be chopped up. So PP1A and PP1AB. And these are processed by two virally encoded cysteine proteases.

26:55.680 --> 27:06.000
 Now, the main protease is also called 3C-like protease. So 3CL protease or 3CL-pro, and there's

27:06.000 --> 27:13.680
 a papain-like protease. So we initially heard about this product, or targeting this, with an

27:13.680 --> 27:21.680
 intravenous preparation. It was PF00835231. It'll be a test at the end. This was a pre-print

27:21.680 --> 27:28.240
 back in February, entitled Discovery of a Novel Inhibitor of Coronavirus 3CL protease

27:28.240 --> 27:34.000
 for the potential treatment of COVID-19. And now Pfizer is suggesting that they'll have the other

27:34.000 --> 27:42.160
 catchy PF07321332. On the market by the end of this year, they have started a phase one trial,

27:42.160 --> 27:49.760
 right? So that's hopefully we're going to have more tools. We also have been hearing from Merck

27:49.760 --> 27:57.680
 and Ridgeback Biopharmaceuticals that they've been working on malnupiravir. And this is a different

27:57.680 --> 28:04.880
 way, a different small molecule potential oral pill that can be used as an antiviral. This is a

28:04.880 --> 28:12.160
 ribonucleoside analog that they have found inhibits replication of multiple RNA viruses. This is

28:12.160 --> 28:17.920
 something they've been working with for a while. People who are familiar with HIV and age treatment

28:17.920 --> 28:25.600
 think of this much like AZT, where you're getting one of those building blocks of the RNA. So an A,

28:25.600 --> 28:31.520
 a C, a G, or a U, we target all these in HIV, and you replace one of these with an analog,

28:31.520 --> 28:37.920
 which then gets brought in and interferes with the virus replication. As we find out more about

28:37.920 --> 28:43.120
 this, I will certainly share that information. All right, so let us finish off here with the

28:43.120 --> 28:49.680
 tail phase long COVID or post COVID. And I think I'm going to call this it is not just about long

28:49.680 --> 28:56.160
 COVID. So early on, I fought against this narrow view, what people thought about COVID, the you're

28:56.160 --> 29:01.520
 either going to live or you die. And that's the end of it. Still, still unfortunately here to this

29:01.520 --> 29:07.040
 day from positions, just sort of this idea that people who are suffering, oh, it's all in their head.

29:07.040 --> 29:13.760
 But I think people are now appreciating, many more people are appreciating that it can be a lot

29:13.760 --> 29:20.080
 more than two weeks once COVID gets into your system, so to speak. But there's also an appreciation

29:20.080 --> 29:24.960
 that maybe there's something more than even just long COVID. I think this is a little discouraging,

29:24.960 --> 29:33.440
 but in nature, there was the article, high dimensional characterization of post acute sequelae of COVID-19.

29:33.440 --> 29:40.240
 Now, what is this about? So the authors in this article used the national health care databases

29:40.240 --> 29:46.320
 of the US departments of Veterans Affairs to systematically and comprehensively identify

29:46.320 --> 29:53.680
 six month incidents sequelae, including diagnoses, medication use, laboratory abnormalities in

29:53.680 --> 30:02.560
 30 day survivors of COVID-19. All right, so this is a really robust database. This cohort was five

30:02.560 --> 30:10.320
 million eight hundred and eight thousand zero one eight participants. And so this, this is a really

30:10.320 --> 30:17.600
 row bust data set that they were looking at. And within those alive, they were looking at the

30:17.600 --> 30:27.600
 COVID-19 group selected having a COVID-19 test that was positive before March 1st 2020 and November

30:27.600 --> 30:35.680
 30 or between I should say between March 1st 2020 and November 30th 2020. So in this large set,

30:35.680 --> 30:40.640
 they had found almost a hundred thousand individuals. And then they're going to look at these

30:40.640 --> 30:47.120
 individuals and what did what did they find? So this study identified a significant increase

30:47.120 --> 30:53.120
 in problems in this population that affected the respiratory system, the nervous system,

30:53.120 --> 30:59.360
 neurocognitive disorders, mental health disorders, metabolic disorders, cardiovascular disorders,

30:59.360 --> 31:06.000
 gastrointestinal disorders, malaise, fatigue, musculosceletal pain, anemia. This population

31:06.000 --> 31:13.360
 had an increased use of many medications, particularly pain medications, opioids, non opioids, antidepressants,

31:13.360 --> 31:20.960
 anxiolytics, antihypertensives, oral hypoglycemics. And they had evidence of laboratory abnormality,

31:20.960 --> 31:26.800
 abnormalities in multiple organ systems. So what I think I'm going to just really point out here

31:26.800 --> 31:32.880
 is that this analysis is suggesting that even people who do not identify or get classified as

31:32.880 --> 31:38.960
 long COVID, there's really a lot of outcomes in addition that we're seeing are an increased

31:38.960 --> 31:44.000
 incidence. And this is actually worth looking at this paper, I will say it's available nature.

31:44.000 --> 31:50.800
 There's actually a gradation, right? So non hospitalized, hospitalized admitted to the ICU,

31:50.800 --> 31:56.080
 the more severe your COVID, the higher incidence we were seeing of all these different

31:56.640 --> 32:02.480
 disorders, right? So I think that we're seeing elevation in the non hospitalized as well,

32:02.480 --> 32:07.520
 but increasing with more severity of disease. So I'm going to finish up on that note. And we

32:07.520 --> 32:12.480
 are switching when this drops, it will be May 1st. Thank you, everyone who supported the

32:12.480 --> 32:18.000
 market side of tropical medicine and hygiene. We are now going to support foundation,

32:18.000 --> 32:22.080
 international medical relief of children. Again, this is going to be a three month campaign.

32:23.280 --> 32:27.040
 To be honest, they're struggling, right? This is an organization that is supported

32:27.840 --> 32:33.680
 through volunteers, younger individuals, excited about global health, signing up,

32:34.400 --> 32:39.360
 contributing, going to all these parts of the world. They need our help. They need your help.

32:39.360 --> 32:44.960
 So take a moment, go to parasites without borders.com and help us support that. We're

32:44.960 --> 32:47.920
 going to do the same thing we've done before. We're going to double those donations. We're

32:47.920 --> 32:52.080
 going to try to get up to $40,000 to support femuric. And we're going to do this over the

32:52.080 --> 32:57.200
 next three months. So help us. Time for some email for Daniel. If you want to send one,

32:57.200 --> 33:04.240
 Daniel at microbe.tv. Sarah in Tallahassee writes, are the monoclonal antibody therapies

33:04.240 --> 33:10.240
 appropriate for patients who have already been vaccinated? So that's a great question. We are

33:10.240 --> 33:15.120
 certainly giving monoclonals to people that have already been vaccinated, or I should word it.

33:15.120 --> 33:19.760
 We are not restricting them. We are not taking a person who's vaccinated, not allowing them to

33:19.760 --> 33:24.240
 have the monoclonals. And there's a couple of reasons here. One, if you think about it,

33:24.240 --> 33:28.320
 there's usually something going on when a person has a breakthrough infection. And we've certainly

33:28.320 --> 33:33.840
 seen people that get vaccinated, and then they go ahead and they get exposed. It's really sort of

33:33.840 --> 33:38.960
 straightforward if they just got the vaccine. But we're seeing people that might be weeks out.

33:38.960 --> 33:44.800
 Some people, particularly our older members of our society, people with certain immune issues,

33:44.800 --> 33:49.440
 they may not have the ability to develop that robust immune system. We're going ahead. We're

33:49.440 --> 33:55.120
 seeing good experiences as we get more numbers. I think we actually closed one of my studies. So

33:55.120 --> 33:59.760
 hopefully we'll be getting some data out there showing demonstrating what's the efficacy in

33:59.760 --> 34:04.720
 different populations, including this particular population. All right, we have a letter from Mike,

34:04.720 --> 34:11.280
 who is an infectious disease physician in Tacoma. In your most recent clinical update, 747,

34:11.280 --> 34:15.680
 you mentioned in your reply to the retired health and safety professional listeners question,

34:16.240 --> 34:21.280
 as to why authorities are not recommending N95 respirators to the public, that you would

34:21.280 --> 34:26.560
 recommend such masks in certain high risk situations or high risk environments. You then

34:26.560 --> 34:31.520
 relayed your own story of how you recommended to your family members to wear KN95 masks when

34:31.520 --> 34:37.680
 they flew on an airplane. The listener mentioned that he thought the KN95 Chinese masks available

34:37.680 --> 34:42.560
 to him locally were likely made of similar materials and of similar quality to the 3M

34:43.120 --> 34:48.560
 N95s. When they first came out, I was initially confused by the different KN95 designation on

34:48.560 --> 34:53.200
 the respirators that were advertised from overseas and have been following the US government's evaluation

34:53.200 --> 34:58.320
 of these masks since the time. Unfortunately, such US government testing has revealed that the

34:58.320 --> 35:04.480
 overseas KN95 testing standards for such overseas masks have not been rigorously quality control.

35:04.480 --> 35:12.480
 Many did not reliably come close to 95% filtration efficiency, and Mike provides a CDC link to

35:13.120 --> 35:18.320
 a report on these masks. Thus, in the interest of being fully transparent to the listener

35:18.320 --> 35:24.080
 who wrote in and to the public, I would suggest that KN95 respirators may provide you with more

35:24.080 --> 35:29.200
 protection against SARS-CoV-2 than a cloth smath, but are overall not as quality controlled and

35:29.200 --> 35:35.280
 would suggest the listener and public consult the above web link for more information.

35:35.280 --> 35:40.720
 That is excellent. So thank you so much. I always like to point out that this is not really a one-man

35:40.720 --> 35:46.400
 show, and stuff like this is super helpful. I'm starting to feel like should I have shared one of

35:46.400 --> 35:52.160
 my KN95s or two of them with my daughter and my wife, but this is really well taken. I think that

35:52.160 --> 35:57.840
 as we go forward, I'm actually surprised at this point that we don't have better certification.

35:57.840 --> 36:02.960
 You get a mask and it's got a certain stamp or a certain... We have certifications for organic

36:02.960 --> 36:08.560
 foods where the certifications to help us with masks, which actually are keeping us safe and

36:08.560 --> 36:13.120
 saving lives. Excellent point, everyone. I'm glad that this was sent in.

36:13.120 --> 36:22.160
 We have an email from Vincent, who is also a physician. Two questions. I recently immunized a

36:22.160 --> 36:28.080
 49-year-old lady who has a history of Parkinson's and an active left septic bursitis with J&J.

36:28.080 --> 36:34.960
 Should I have left held off due to her bursitis? Or was I right in doing so? Let's take that one

36:34.960 --> 36:40.320
 first, Daniel. So you did the right thing. Never missed an opportunity to immunize that.

36:40.320 --> 36:44.800
 I'm hoping you didn't put the immunization in that bursa, right? Maybe you did the other arm that

36:44.800 --> 36:50.480
 would make a lot of sense. I got a question earlier today and actually it was about every

36:50.480 --> 36:54.160
 so often we see people. We've got people doing vaccines that maybe have never done them before

36:54.160 --> 36:57.840
 and they're somehow they get it in the bursa, which is actually usually a challenge, right?

36:57.840 --> 37:03.680
 Because we're trying to learn to do that for other reasons. But try not to get it in the bursa.

37:04.240 --> 37:07.840
 Do the other side if someone has bursitis. If they get it in the bursa,

37:07.840 --> 37:14.000
 probably we're still going to get the protection. I think it would make sense that you will.

37:14.800 --> 37:19.280
 But no, I don't think something like a bursitis. We really have to be careful not let little

37:19.280 --> 37:23.840
 things keep us from getting a person vaccinated. So I think you did the right thing. Now,

37:24.320 --> 37:28.240
 hopefully I laid out the risks with J&J really small.

37:28.240 --> 37:33.760
 Yeah, and then his next question is about J&J. Is it stand to reason to treat with aspirin prophylactically

37:33.760 --> 37:38.080
 or just wait it out? Yeah, and I've actually had this conversation with a lot of clinicians.

37:38.080 --> 37:43.280
 So it really is excellent. It's a good question. If you start doing the risk benefit,

37:43.280 --> 37:47.440
 and this was interesting, right? I started asking people, so what if you tell someone to take an

37:47.440 --> 37:52.320
 aspirin every day? 1% of those people will have a GI bleed within the year, right? We didn't pull

37:52.320 --> 37:59.120
 aspirin off the market when that happened. You are better off doing nothing. First, do no harm.

37:59.120 --> 38:04.080
 You are more likely to cause problems to someone after a J&J than you're going to

38:04.080 --> 38:09.120
 provide any help by throwing aspirin or anything at them. So go ahead, get them vaccinated. And

38:09.120 --> 38:12.640
 then if they have a severe headache, that one in a million will pick it up, we'll treat them

38:12.640 --> 38:17.840
 properly. All right, one more from Chris in your recent clinical update. You said

38:18.400 --> 38:23.680
 responsible summer camps should be doing testing because there's funding for it now. I'm on the

38:23.680 --> 38:29.360
 board of a summer camp. This is good news, but I can't find any information. Can you please

38:29.360 --> 38:35.600
 point to more information about this? Okay, I'm going to actually, I'm going to say this slowly

38:35.600 --> 38:41.600
 because we'll be giving this person a bunch of emails, hopefully. I've been working with a woman

38:41.600 --> 38:49.520
 Phoebe for about the last year, helping promote access to coordination for particularly rapid

38:49.520 --> 38:56.320
 testing, but testing in general as a solution. And so Phoebe has worked with rapid testing.org,

38:56.320 --> 39:01.840
 also worked with a lot of different foundations, and actually did a lot to push for funding in

39:01.840 --> 39:07.680
 these bills. So I can give her a little credit for that. Now I asked Phoebe previously, and she

39:07.680 --> 39:15.360
 said yes that I could share when people had questions like this. So her email is P-O-L-H-A-V-A

39:15.360 --> 39:21.040
 at gmail.com. If you're a summer camp, if you're looking for ways to get access to testing,

39:21.760 --> 39:26.240
 shoot her an email. She's not in this to make any money. I think she must make money as a

39:26.240 --> 39:31.200
 radiologist or something. She's just there to help doing all these efforts pro bono. So

39:32.080 --> 39:37.520
 reach out. Let's make sure that that money actually is spent, that that testing keeps our kids safe.

39:37.520 --> 39:42.720
 That's COVID-19 clinical update number 60 with Dr. Daniel Griffin. Thank you, Daniel.

39:42.720 --> 39:49.440
 Oh, thank you so much. And everyone, be safe.
