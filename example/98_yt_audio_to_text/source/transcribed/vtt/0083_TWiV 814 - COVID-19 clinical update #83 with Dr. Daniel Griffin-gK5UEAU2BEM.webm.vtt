 This week in virology, the podcast about viruses, the kind that make you sick.

00:11.040 --> 00:21.440
 From Microbe TV, this is Twiv. This week in virology, episode 814 recorded on October 7th, 2021.

00:21.440 --> 00:27.920
 I'm Vincent Rackeniello, and you're listening to the podcast All About Viruses. Joining me

00:27.920 --> 00:34.960
 today from New York, Daniel Griffin. Hello, everyone. How's everything, Daniel?

00:36.240 --> 00:42.240
 You know, it's actually all right, you know, right here in the immediate area. Actually,

00:42.240 --> 00:46.320
 if you look around the country, right, things are on the way down. Actually, if you look around

00:46.320 --> 00:52.000
 the world, there's these sort of interesting cycles where things shoot up, and then it goes down,

00:52.000 --> 00:58.080
 and we'll see where we go. But yeah, at the moment, particularly in the immediate area, but

00:58.080 --> 01:02.800
 I was in a call earlier today. Actually, Shane Crotty was on the call. It's funny,

01:02.800 --> 01:07.840
 because like when things come up, you know, people may think I know a lot, but I always, I'm like,

01:07.840 --> 01:14.080
 and can I call in a friend, Shane? Can I call on you? So yeah, but in parts of the country,

01:14.080 --> 01:18.640
 some of my colleagues on the call, it's not so great, right? There's a lot of parts of our

01:18.640 --> 01:25.040
 country where hospitals are still overflowing, where, you know, people just not even COVID, just

01:25.040 --> 01:29.840
 normal medical issues, they can't be seen, they're waiting, it's delaying care.

01:30.800 --> 01:38.000
 Yeah, so we know by no means are we through this storm. Yeah, we have an email about that sort of

01:38.000 --> 01:43.360
 situation in a certain part of the country today. Yeah, certain parts of the country, not so great.

01:43.360 --> 01:48.080
 Well, let me start with my quotation, and then I'm going to actually share what I think is an

01:48.080 --> 01:54.400
 entertaining story, which has a certain, well, that's a certain reason for sharing it. So the

01:54.400 --> 02:02.480
 quotation, there are in fact two things, science and opinion. The former begets knowledge, the latter

02:02.480 --> 02:08.720
 ignorance. And this is by Hippocrates. I just think this is very telling. I'm always a little

02:08.720 --> 02:13.920
 disappointed when some of my colleagues seem to be sort of searching for confirmation bias to

02:13.920 --> 02:20.320
 support their opinion, and not really just trying to move forward and learn. Hopefully, I'm trying

02:20.320 --> 02:27.120
 to keep my opinions to a minimum and share the science so that people can form their own opinions

02:27.120 --> 02:33.520
 based upon that science. Sort of an interesting story I think I'll share and these are dark times

02:33.520 --> 02:36.960
 in many parts of the country. But this was a story that actually, it was the first time I

02:36.960 --> 02:43.040
 laughed at work and well, it's been quite a while. But it was a friend, a colleague of mine who was

02:43.040 --> 02:48.800
 telling me a story, he's embraced monoclonals, he's even though he's a cardiologist. And he's

02:48.800 --> 02:54.480
 like, yeah, I sent this guy for monoclonals. And I was all excited that we got that done. But then

02:54.480 --> 02:59.200
 he left an office, he left a message at the office that he went for the monoclonals. He's doing great

02:59.200 --> 03:04.240
 now, but but he almost died. And it's like, well, my gosh, what happened? You know, it's surprising

03:04.240 --> 03:09.840
 because these monoclonals are so safe. What happened? Well, apparently, this gentleman went for the

03:09.840 --> 03:16.240
 monoclonals during one of these massive rainstorms that we had. And one of the things we do, right,

03:16.240 --> 03:20.720
 we send people like during that first week, they're feverish, they're sick, and they've got to get

03:20.720 --> 03:26.400
 into a car and either go to a tent, or in this case, go to an emergency room, get checked in,

03:26.400 --> 03:31.840
 be there for a number of hours, get the infusion, which he went ahead and did. But as he was leaving,

03:31.840 --> 03:39.360
 it was a torrential downpour. And so this feverish guy gets in his car and drives into an area of

03:39.360 --> 03:45.200
 such degree of flooding that it's actually up to the window level and his car completely stalls.

03:45.200 --> 03:51.440
 He has to actually smash out the window and then climb out the window and swim to where it's

03:51.440 --> 03:57.680
 shallow enough. And then the first person who offers to help him, he lets them know he has

03:57.680 --> 04:04.480
 COVID and they drive away. The police then come and they offer to drive him home until he informs

04:04.480 --> 04:09.440
 them that he has COVID. A little bit of a pause. They call his wife who then picks him up and

04:09.440 --> 04:18.640
 picks him home. So this was his harrowing monoclonal infusion experience. But then as he called my

04:18.640 --> 04:26.960
 colleague, Dr. Savie said, you know, the next evening, he felt like 100%. He felt great, despite

04:26.960 --> 04:34.480
 having COVID, despite having to swim through these freezing water. So good story. Yeah,

04:34.480 --> 04:39.200
 it's a very, very entertaining story. But yeah, this is one of those reasons why it would be nice

04:39.200 --> 04:44.400
 to be doing these in the home, bringing the therapies to these individuals, making it a little,

04:44.400 --> 04:50.800
 a little more accessible. All right. So some important updates, important dates for people

04:50.800 --> 04:57.840
 to put on their calendar. They're on my calendar. October 14 will be a discussion of the Moderna

04:57.840 --> 05:02.720
 booster. Interesting enough, as I found out from my in-laws, everyone's already getting

05:02.720 --> 05:07.520
 them Moderna booster. So I don't know what they're talking about. Apparently, you know,

05:07.520 --> 05:16.400
 boosters for all. So but this will be specifically Moderna is requesting a specific Moderna third

05:16.400 --> 05:23.120
 dose, which would be half the dose of the first two. So we'll hear what the FDA independent advisory

05:23.120 --> 05:31.440
 panel has to say on that. The next October 15th, Jay and Jay is going to be having the FDA

05:31.440 --> 05:35.920
 independent advisory committee discuss a booster for them. And I think we talked about the data

05:35.920 --> 05:43.200
 there, which is actually, I would say rather compelling getting that protection for severe

05:43.200 --> 05:49.200
 disease, hospitalization, up into the 90s, kind of at mRNA level, if you give that second dose. So

05:49.200 --> 05:54.560
 that will be interesting to hear, but we're sort of getting positive signals on a Jay and Jay

05:55.840 --> 06:00.560
 one and you're not done. I guess you need a second now. And also the heterologous

06:00.560 --> 06:07.360
 booster, the mix and match. What if you had one vaccine, can you get another? A lot of people

06:07.360 --> 06:12.320
 say, boy, I got the Pfizer. Can I just get the Moderna as my third dose? My mother actually,

06:12.320 --> 06:16.000
 she was talking to my dad last night. So yeah, your mother, she's already signed up for her third

06:16.000 --> 06:20.400
 dose. She she's going to get a Moderna. I'm like, what? And so I talked to my mother, she was like,

06:20.400 --> 06:25.680
 yeah, they call me back. I had two Pfizers and I want to get a Moderna and they told me I can't do

06:25.680 --> 06:32.400
 that. So we will find out what happens on the 15th. She still she's going to wait a little bit longer

06:32.400 --> 06:39.120
 to get a little more data before she and I make that decision. And then October 26 for a lot of

06:39.120 --> 06:46.800
 people Pfizer vaccine for kids, five to 11. And I'm going to talk a little bit about the fact that

06:46.800 --> 06:51.920
 this is going to be packaged differently, a different dose, actually even a different amount will be

06:51.920 --> 06:57.920
 injected. But we'll get to that as well. All right, so let us start off with children, COVID.

06:58.560 --> 07:04.960
 Children are at risk for COVID. I think that's now clear. And as I like to say, wearing a mask is

07:04.960 --> 07:10.800
 less traumatic for a child than being hospitalized. And we keep hearing about numbers in children,

07:10.800 --> 07:16.480
 but as numbers go down across the country, we had been up to this quarter million number for

07:16.480 --> 07:22.640
 children that's dropping below 200,000. So they're moving in the right direction there per week.

07:23.360 --> 07:27.680
 Hospitalization is getting a little bit of improvement. But again, this is regional where

07:27.680 --> 07:32.880
 we're seeing problems. But one of the things I wanted to talk about is I'll say success and

07:32.880 --> 07:38.480
 maybe when there wasn't success with getting children back out there for in-person activity.

07:38.480 --> 07:45.360
 So we have some data now on how did we do this summer in places where there was good guidance,

07:45.360 --> 07:50.240
 vaccination, masking, et cetera, mitigation measures versus where there wasn't. So we're

07:50.240 --> 07:56.720
 talking about a couple MMWR early releases. The first is multi component strategies to prevent

07:56.720 --> 08:03.840
 SARS-CoV-2 transmission, nine overnight youth summer camps, the United States, June through August 2021.

08:04.400 --> 08:10.400
 So as mentioned, this came out as an MMWR early release. And the authors reported on a total of

08:10.400 --> 08:18.960
 7,173 campers and staff that attended nine US overnight camps that implemented multiple

08:18.960 --> 08:25.520
 prevention strategies, including high vaccination coverage that was greater than 93% among eligible

08:25.520 --> 08:33.040
 persons, pre-arrival and frequent screening testing. That was a total of 38,059 tests

08:33.760 --> 08:38.960
 and additional prevention measures during this time period. There were only nine laboratory

08:38.960 --> 08:44.800
 confirmed COVID-19 cases and no secondary infections detected during this period. So

08:45.440 --> 08:53.520
 as I like to say, we can do this safely. On the other side of the coin, we can also mess this up.

08:53.520 --> 09:04.320
 COVID-19 outbreaks at youth summer camps, Louisiana, June through July 2021, came out also as an MMWR early release.

09:04.320 --> 09:12.560
 And here the authors were describing 28 camp outbreaks. There was a 31-fold increase in confirmed

09:12.560 --> 09:18.880
 camp associated cases compared with the previous summer. And the authors comment that this period

09:18.880 --> 09:24.160
 coincided with underutilization of preventive measures, such as the vaccines, the masking,

09:24.160 --> 09:31.920
 the physical distancing. So you remove those mitigation measures and you can do this poorly.

09:33.840 --> 09:39.040
 All right. Well, with the expansion, the impending, we hope, expansion of COVID vaccines

09:39.840 --> 09:45.120
 down to the 5 and 11-year-old. There's been a lot of discussions about trying to normalize

09:45.120 --> 09:50.560
 the COVID vaccines, trying to get them into pediatrician offices, because a lot of parents

09:50.560 --> 09:55.360
 want to have that discussion with pediatricians, not go to one of these mass vaccination sites.

09:55.360 --> 10:00.400
 Actually, it's coming up a lot. A lot of individuals don't really feel that comfortable going to one

10:00.400 --> 10:07.520
 of these large sites with the security presence. Maybe I have a little bit of this bias. You know,

10:07.520 --> 10:11.520
 if we're lost, my wife will go ask a police officer. I will. If I see a police officer,

10:11.520 --> 10:16.480
 maybe go the other direction, maybe this is by upbringing. You know, I always joke with the

10:16.480 --> 10:20.480
 police officers when I see them. My last name is Griffin, and we try to calculate how many

10:20.480 --> 10:24.480
 griffins were in the front seat as police officers and how many of us were in the vaccine cause and

10:24.480 --> 10:31.440
 trouble. But this vaccine, we are hoping a lot of parents are hoping they will be able to access

10:31.440 --> 10:37.200
 in the pediatrician's office. So just a little bit about what are we expecting on the horizon. So

10:37.200 --> 10:46.080
 the current Pfizer vaccine that we've been giving out has a purple cap. But we are hearing that the

10:46.080 --> 10:52.240
 new caps for the children will be orange caps. These are going to be different vials. They're

10:52.240 --> 10:58.080
 going to be 10 dose vials instead of the five slash six that we were doing before. It's going to be

10:58.080 --> 11:05.920
 a different amount to dilution. This is going to be a 1.3 ml dilution. The injection rather than

11:05.920 --> 11:14.320
 0.3 is going to be a 0.2 injection. These can sit in the ultra cold freezer for six months,

11:14.320 --> 11:20.560
 but you can put them in the refrigerator undiluted for 10 weeks, right? That's two and a half months.

11:20.560 --> 11:24.880
 So that's going to be a great way of getting these in pediatrician's offices, getting those

11:24.880 --> 11:30.240
 sitting there in the refrigerator. We all, as I think sort of embarrassingly say, we have a lot

11:30.240 --> 11:34.880
 of vaccines. We expect to have a lot of these. So we're not going to be, we're not expecting

11:34.880 --> 11:38.960
 people to be quite as stringent with the like, don't waste a dose. It's going to be more of a

11:38.960 --> 11:44.320
 don't miss an opportunity to vaccinate. There's also for the over 12, there's going to be a,

11:44.320 --> 11:51.600
 we hear a new gray top to vial that is already pre-diluted. And this can then sit pre-diluted

11:51.600 --> 11:57.200
 in a refrigerator for 10 weeks undiluted, or actually, let me see if I've got this right,

11:57.200 --> 12:04.320
 already deluded to the consent for 10 weeks. All right. So pre-exposure transmission testing,

12:04.320 --> 12:10.720
 another nice paper looking at the impact of vaccination on transmission. And this is really,

12:10.720 --> 12:16.000
 I think as we've discussed, the community motivation behind vaccination and the pandemic,

12:16.000 --> 12:21.840
 rather than just looking at individual risks. So we saw the pre-print, the impact of SARS-CoV-2

12:21.840 --> 12:28.640
 vaccination on alpha and delta variant transmission. And this study was performed as part of the

12:28.640 --> 12:35.200
 public health surveillance and NHS test and trace program quality assurance. And the authors

12:35.920 --> 12:41.040
 start by providing a little bit of background that the pre-delta, there was evidence that there was

12:41.040 --> 12:46.640
 some impact. And now they're going ahead and looking at the risk going forward. So they,

12:46.640 --> 12:53.200
 they performed a retrospective observational cohort study of contacts of SARS-CoV-2

12:53.200 --> 13:00.640
 infected index cases using contact testing data from England. And in this study,

13:01.680 --> 13:09.120
 37.2% of the contacts tested were PCR positive. They looked at two doses of the

13:09.120 --> 13:18.320
 BioNTech Pfizer or the Chadox as AstraZeneca in the alpha variant index cases. And the reductions

13:18.320 --> 13:29.040
 they were seeing, the adjusted odds ratio 0.18 versus 0.37. So about 82% reduction, about a 63%

13:29.040 --> 13:37.680
 reduction. But then when they looked at the delta variant, the odds ratio is 0.35 and 0.64. So about

13:37.680 --> 13:44.400
 a 65% reduction, about a 36% reduction. So not working quite as well. There was an interesting

13:44.400 --> 13:49.840
 comment. And I think that this is important and maybe plays into as people think about boosters.

13:50.640 --> 13:57.520
 Transmission reductions declined over time since the second vaccination for delta reaching similar

13:57.520 --> 14:03.440
 levels to unvaccinated by 12 weeks for Chadox and attenuating substantially for BioNTech

14:03.440 --> 14:10.080
 162 B2, the Pfizer BioNTech. So protection from vaccination in contacts declined in the three

14:10.080 --> 14:15.840
 months after second vaccination. So sort of this challenge, our vaccines are really great

14:16.560 --> 14:21.760
 at preventing hospitalizations and severe disease. But how long are we going to get this

14:21.760 --> 14:27.040
 impact on infection? How long are we going to get this impact on transmission reductions?

14:27.040 --> 14:35.040
 I've also made several questions about a couple AstraZeneca products.

14:35.760 --> 14:43.920
 The first one is the the the mabs that they have. And these are these long acting antibody

14:43.920 --> 14:54.240
 therapies. So AstraZeneca's AZD7442, very catchy, requests for emergency authorization for COVID-19

14:54.240 --> 15:00.640
 prophylaxis was filed in the US. So these are long acting monoclonals for prevention. And so

15:00.640 --> 15:09.840
 this request was was based mainly on data from the ProVent trial, PROVEND trial, where 5197

15:09.840 --> 15:19.200
 participants in a two to one randomization received this AZD7442, which has two mabs in there. And I'm

15:19.200 --> 15:23.120
 not going to go into which they are because this has become a pronunciation challenge.

15:23.120 --> 15:31.280
 And they compared this to placebo. And the primary analysis was based on 5172 participants

15:31.280 --> 15:38.880
 who did not have SARS COVID-2 infection in baseline in this trial, 77% reduction in

15:38.880 --> 15:45.520
 developing symptomatic COVID compared to placebo. So what's special here, right? And we've already

15:45.520 --> 15:51.280
 talked about how Regen Cove can be used in the EUA and we will go through the details on that

15:51.280 --> 15:59.280
 as a prophylactic. But here, this can be given IV or IM, right, as opposed to sub-Q. It's a little

15:59.280 --> 16:05.760
 nicer to give this IM. This was actually gluteal. So this was given in the tail. There's also a

16:05.760 --> 16:11.520
 longer half-life here. So these antibodies were optimized to have an extended half-life,

16:11.520 --> 16:18.720
 reduced FC receptor and complement C1Q binding. And so they are actually suggesting that this

16:18.720 --> 16:25.760
 can afford up to 12 months of protection following a single administration. So a lot of questions

16:25.760 --> 16:29.840
 I'm getting from my colleagues who take care of individuals who are immune suppressed.

16:30.640 --> 16:35.120
 We'll say cancer patients, patients with autoimmune disease, patients on immunosuppressive

16:35.120 --> 16:39.280
 medications, patients that we do not think are going to get the protection that we would like

16:39.280 --> 16:45.920
 from vaccinations or maybe even have a contraindication to vaccination. This is potentially a way of

16:45.920 --> 16:54.720
 providing passive protection. A little exciting news on the testing front, right? We've sort of

16:54.720 --> 16:59.680
 gone full circle and there's been a lot of folks embracing and really seeing the power of the

16:59.680 --> 17:07.120
 rapid tests, but also the at-home rapid tests. So on the 4th of October, the US FDA issued another

17:07.120 --> 17:16.720
 EUA for the ACON Laboratory's Flowflex COVID-19 home test. Per the manufacturer, they are planning

17:16.720 --> 17:22.720
 and they claim they have the capacity to produce more than 100 million tests per month. They think

17:22.720 --> 17:30.720
 they'll be able to ramp this up to 200 million per month by February 2022. So very exciting because

17:30.720 --> 17:34.960
 right now, as we know, everyone's excited about home tests, but no one can get them. I even tried

17:34.960 --> 17:40.960
 to do this myself. They are in short supply. And also, if you want to understand how to use these,

17:40.960 --> 17:46.560
 because right, you're going to be swabbing yourself the same day the CDC updated their COVID

17:47.360 --> 17:53.040
 self testing page where you can see some really nice infographics about how to stick that Q-tip

17:53.040 --> 17:59.440
 up your nose and get these samples. I presume this is an antigen test, Daniel? Yes.

17:59.440 --> 18:09.200
 Yeah. Is it going to be less than a dollar? Let's see if I have the money. Let's see if I have the

18:09.200 --> 18:15.040
 cost here. I do not know what the cost is going to be, but will it be less than a dollar? The answer is

18:15.040 --> 18:25.360
 no. Will it be maybe $5? Maybe, maybe. There is the potential that the US government will purchase

18:25.360 --> 18:31.360
 a lot of these and then distribute them. So that could be, well, not quite free because we're paying

18:31.360 --> 18:38.000
 our taxes. All right, active vaccination, you know, vaccines, the Jabs that keep you from getting

18:38.000 --> 18:43.360
 sick. And I like to say vaccination is how this pandemic ends. I'm talking about those first doses.

18:43.360 --> 18:47.600
 That's where we get our bag for our buck. In the New England Journal, we saw the peer read

18:47.600 --> 18:57.120
 publication Phase 3, safety and efficacy of the Chad Ox 1 COVID-19 vaccine. And these are the

18:57.120 --> 19:03.120
 finally, we're getting the peer reviewed publication of the ongoing results from the ongoing double

19:03.120 --> 19:09.120
 blind randomized placebo controlled Phase 3 clinical trial, looking at the safety, vaccine

19:09.120 --> 19:16.400
 efficacy, and immunogenicity of two doses of the AstraZeneca Chad Ox as compared with placebo

19:16.400 --> 19:21.440
 in preventing is always important. What are we looking at the onset of symptomatic and severe

19:21.440 --> 19:28.480
 COVID disease 2019 15 days or more after the second dose in adults, including older adults in the

19:28.480 --> 19:38.240
 United States, Chile and Peru. In this trial, a total of 32,451 participants underwent randomization

19:38.240 --> 19:48.240
 in a two to one ratio to receive this vaccine or placebo. So we had 21,635 versus placebo 10,816.

19:48.240 --> 19:57.200
 And the overall vaccine efficacy for preventing symptomatic and severe was 74%. Interesting enough,

19:57.200 --> 20:05.920
 the estimated vaccine efficacy for this endpoint was 83.5% in participants 65 years of age or older.

20:05.920 --> 20:11.840
 They report that this high vaccine efficacy was consistent across a range of demographic

20:11.840 --> 20:19.120
 subgroups. In the fully vaccinated analysis subgroup, they reported no severe or critical

20:19.120 --> 20:24.640
 symptomatic COVID-19 cases. So that's, you know, you got to think about our endpoints. So that's

20:24.640 --> 20:32.160
 a pretty excellent endpoint for looking at severe or critical disease 83.5 for symptomatic. So

20:32.160 --> 20:42.720
 a pretty, pretty impressive data here. On October 4th in the Lancet, we saw another article. Again,

20:42.720 --> 20:51.120
 on vaccines, effectiveness of mRNA, BNT, 162, B2, Pfizer, BioNTech, COVID-19 vaccine up to six months

20:51.120 --> 20:56.880
 and a large integrated health system in the US, a retrospective cohort study. So this is a peer

20:56.880 --> 21:02.240
 reviewed article. This is a retrospective cohort study where they analyzed electronic health

21:02.240 --> 21:09.520
 records of individuals who are members of Kaiser Permanente, South California. They were looking

21:09.520 --> 21:17.200
 at the effectiveness against infections and COVID-19 related hospital admissions for up to six months.

21:17.200 --> 21:23.040
 So this is a, this is a very robust data set, right, by an organization that I'll say does an

21:23.040 --> 21:34.560
 excellent job. 4,920,549 individuals were assessed for eligibility and ultimately 3,436,

21:35.120 --> 21:43.120
 9,957 were included. So for fully vaccinated infections, they report fully vaccinated

21:43.120 --> 21:49.840
 individuals, they report that effectiveness against infections declined from 88% during the first

21:49.840 --> 21:56.880
 month to 47%. So that's effectiveness against infection. So among sequenced infections,

21:56.880 --> 22:02.320
 vaccine efficacy, effectiveness against infections of the Delta variant was high during the forced

22:02.320 --> 22:10.000
 month, 93%. And that went to 53% after four months, effectiveness against other variants,

22:10.000 --> 22:17.360
 the first month, 97%, 67%, at four to five months. But what about vaccine effectiveness

22:17.360 --> 22:24.320
 against hospital admissions for infections with the Delta variant, 93% up to six months.

22:25.280 --> 22:31.280
 So I take away this as very encouraging. I know Pfizer vaccine has been getting a lot of bad press,

22:32.080 --> 22:36.560
 you know, people are a little upset that they get the Pfizer and set of Moderna, but vaccine

22:36.560 --> 22:41.440
 effectiveness against severe disease, right, hospital admissions with the Delta variant,

22:41.440 --> 22:45.840
 93% for up to six months. So I found this rather encouraging.

22:45.840 --> 22:50.400
 What about reinfection? I get a lot of questions about this.

22:51.200 --> 22:56.080
 And so there's a lot of articles out there, but this article, the durability of immunity

22:56.080 --> 23:02.000
 against reinfection by SARS-CoV-2, a comparative evolutionary study was published in the Lancet

23:02.000 --> 23:07.440
 Microbe. So we certainly see reinfections, mainly starting about three months after infection and

23:07.440 --> 23:14.720
 increasing over time. We know that if these folks get vaccinated, they can decrease their risk of

23:14.720 --> 23:22.640
 infection by at least twofold. We're not sure one dose got us there, but two doses did in the MMWR

23:22.640 --> 23:27.760
 publication we talked about. So if prior infection, we know that these individuals can get a benefit

23:27.760 --> 23:34.480
 from vaccination. In this study, the authors looked at antibody data for six human infecting

23:34.480 --> 23:42.320
 coronaviruses, extending from 128 days to 28 years after infection. This is a pretty broad

23:42.320 --> 23:50.800
 study, infection between 1984 and 2020. They use this data to estimate profiles of the typical

23:50.800 --> 23:57.760
 antibody decline and probabilities of reinfection over time under endemic conditions. They estimated

23:57.760 --> 24:04.720
 that reinfection by SARS-CoV-2 under endemic conditions would likely occur between three months

24:04.720 --> 24:12.560
 out to 5.1 years after the peak in the antibody response, suggesting a median of about 16 months.

24:13.520 --> 24:18.240
 They calculated that this protection is less than half the duration revealed for the other

24:18.240 --> 24:27.040
 endemic circulating coronaviruses. So OC43, NL63, 229E, if people have those remembered.

24:27.040 --> 24:32.080
 But what I'm going to say for a deeper dive into the comparison between protection from infection

24:32.080 --> 24:39.120
 versus vaccination, I'm going to recommend people go to 12, 813 discussion with Florian Kramer.

24:40.320 --> 24:47.200
 It's really a popular topic that people are trying to sort out. But just to make it clear,

24:47.200 --> 24:53.040
 we recommend that people who have been previously infected get the benefit of vaccination.

24:54.240 --> 24:59.040
 A popular question now, I don't know if Vincent, if you are aware of this, but I keep getting,

24:59.040 --> 25:02.960
 am I still considered fully vaccinated if I haven't had my booster?

25:04.240 --> 25:09.520
 And straight from the CDC, yes, everyone is considered fully vaccinated two weeks after their

25:09.520 --> 25:16.320
 second COVID vaccine in a two-shot series, or two weeks after a single dose vaccine for the

25:16.320 --> 25:21.520
 J&J Janssen for those folks here in the US. So I've been getting a lot of employers,

25:21.520 --> 25:27.440
 interesting enough, who are now demanding that their employees get a third dose,

25:27.440 --> 25:31.040
 otherwise they're not considered fully vaccinated. But straight from the CDC,

25:31.040 --> 25:37.040
 this is evolving, but at the moment, you're still good. I know we're up to 400,000 people

25:37.040 --> 25:44.560
 getting a booster per day here in the US. So yeah, anyway, all right, passive vaccination.

25:44.560 --> 25:49.920
 I want to remind people, remember monoclonals after high risk exposures and high risk people.

25:49.920 --> 25:56.800
 We talked a little bit about AstraZeneca is applying for this, but we already have post-exposure

25:56.800 --> 26:04.560
 prophylaxis as part of the EUA for Regen Cove. And who are the people that they are recommending

26:05.120 --> 26:11.040
 eligible for post-exposure prophylaxis? These are individuals who are at high risk for progression

26:11.040 --> 26:16.080
 to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death. These are folks who are either not

26:16.080 --> 26:22.960
 fully vaccinated or are not expected to mount an adequate immune response to the SARS-CoV-2

26:22.960 --> 26:28.720
 vaccination, right? So individuals with immunocompromising conditions, those on immunosuppressive

26:28.720 --> 26:35.360
 medicines. So you're looking at individuals who have been exposed. But I also want to point out

26:35.360 --> 26:41.680
 they also talk about for individuals in whom repeat dosing is considered because they continue

26:41.680 --> 26:49.600
 to have ongoing exposure. So just a little bit of subtlety there. An individual who is immunosuppressed,

26:49.600 --> 26:54.720
 who is not getting that protection from vaccine, but continues to be exposed over and over.

26:55.360 --> 27:01.600
 The first dose is the 600, 600. But you can actually continue to dose them every four weeks

27:02.400 --> 27:08.880
 with a 300 milligram, 300 milligram. And that can either be by subcutaneous injection. So in this

27:08.880 --> 27:13.440
 sense, then we have to get two instead of four shots, or they can get an intravenous infusion

27:13.440 --> 27:19.920
 every four weeks. For while we were stepping back a little on prophylaxis because of shortages,

27:19.920 --> 27:24.960
 but as the numbers are going down, as we're getting improved access, we're stretching back

27:24.960 --> 27:31.920
 out with the post-exposure prophylaxis. All right, the period of detectable viral replication,

27:31.920 --> 27:35.840
 not the time for antibiotics, and not the time for steroids. We can do harm there.

27:36.960 --> 27:41.520
 This is for a lot of people exciting. The beginning of a new era, Merck and Ridgeback

27:41.520 --> 27:46.880
 announced the planned interim analysis results from the phase three move out trial, looking at

27:46.880 --> 27:54.640
 the use of the oral antiviral. This is a pill, malnupiravir, in the early treatment of at-risk,

27:54.640 --> 28:01.760
 non-hospitalized adult patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. So this was a planned interim

28:01.760 --> 28:09.120
 analysis. They evaluated data from 775 patients who were initially enrolled in the trial, the phase

28:09.120 --> 28:15.600
 three move out trial. And at the time of the decision to stop recruiting, the trial was approaching

28:15.600 --> 28:23.120
 full recruitment, sample size of 1,550 patients with more than 90% of the intended sample size already

28:23.120 --> 28:28.960
 enrolled. When they perform this interim analysis, and I want to point out, this is top line data.

28:28.960 --> 28:33.520
 This is not peer reviewed. We don't have the details that will be coming forward. They reported

28:33.520 --> 28:41.680
 in this study that malnupiravir reduced the risk of hospitalization or death by approximately

28:41.680 --> 28:52.400
 50%. So we had 7.3% versus 14.1%. The little bit of sort of details here,

28:52.400 --> 28:58.400
 in the individuals that received the antiviral, there were zero deaths. In the placebo group,

28:58.400 --> 29:04.000
 there were eight deaths. So we're looking at zero versus 2%. So 2%, the expected mortality,

29:04.000 --> 29:10.800
 zero percent in the folks that got this therapy. What about eligibility and timing? These

29:10.800 --> 29:17.120
 individuals had to have laboratory confirmed COVID-19 with symptom onset within five days

29:17.120 --> 29:22.480
 of study randomization, right? So a little bit longer than we would ideally want, right? Because

29:22.480 --> 29:27.600
 you get randomized at day five may take you another day before you actually get the therapy.

29:27.600 --> 29:32.320
 All the patients had to have at least one risk factor associated with poor disease outcome,

29:32.320 --> 29:39.760
 right? So this is a slightly higher risk group. People did well, very well tolerated

29:40.560 --> 29:48.400
 therapy. There is a recommendation to go ahead and look at possibly getting EUA. So we will find

29:48.960 --> 29:52.560
 as we go forward. But just a little background, right? Because this is going to be one of the

29:52.560 --> 30:00.720
 first drugs here that is being introduced. This is a RNA, dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor,

30:00.720 --> 30:07.040
 right? That's something that we mammals don't have to worry about. There is going to be discussion

30:07.040 --> 30:11.840
 about the safety of this drug. That's why it's going to go through the FDA. But this is really

30:11.840 --> 30:19.040
 the first in this class going forward. We expect there to be another very similar drug. And we also

30:19.040 --> 30:25.200
 expect another drug that we've talked about that's going to target the protease on the horizon. So

30:25.200 --> 30:30.240
 fingers crossed, we're looking about three oral drugs being available by December. But I was

30:30.240 --> 30:33.360
 going to, I was going to Vincent, do you want to make any comments at this point? I sort of thought

30:33.360 --> 30:39.760
 this was an exciting bit of news. I think it's great that we these are in development. My only

30:39.760 --> 30:46.800
 concern, and I'm sure as a physician who treats AIDS patients, Daniel, these will be initially

30:46.800 --> 30:51.040
 used as monotherapy. And I'm just concerned that we're going to get rapid resistance,

30:51.040 --> 30:56.320
 which will render them less useful. What do you think? Yeah. So I hopefully we've learned from

30:56.320 --> 31:02.960
 the HIV. And we've also learned from influenza, right? Is that if you use these drugs all by

31:02.960 --> 31:07.600
 themselves, you run a risk, particularly if they're used widely, which we're thinking they will be

31:07.600 --> 31:14.320
 of inducing resistance. So I've already talked about the concept of maybe using this with maybe

31:14.320 --> 31:20.240
 the protease inhibitor, maybe if we can use two drugs, we can put up a barrier to that resistance.

31:20.240 --> 31:27.120
 So no, I think I think that's key. Anytime we use a drug, we we can end up with resistance. So it may

31:27.120 --> 31:31.360
 be that we want to look at using two drugs that we're not pressuring and driving that.

31:32.640 --> 31:36.640
 I worry particularly if people use this more than just as a five day therapy. What if you have

31:36.640 --> 31:39.920
 a person who's immunosuppressed and you start using it for a longer period of time?

31:39.920 --> 31:45.200
 But don't you have to trial them in combinations to get them approved that way?

31:45.200 --> 31:46.240
 Yeah, we're going to have to do that.

31:48.160 --> 31:53.200
 And this will be two different drug companies, three drug companies all like

31:53.200 --> 31:58.160
 playing nicely working together. But it is interesting with HIV, we're often using

31:59.520 --> 32:04.080
 three drug therapy. That's kind of the triple highly effective antiretroviral therapy,

32:04.800 --> 32:09.280
 where often historically, it was three different companies were producing each

32:09.280 --> 32:15.840
 of the different drugs in the cocktail. All right, timing. So we've got exciting

32:15.840 --> 32:22.320
 stuff because the IDSA meeting was just recently. And so this was data that was presented there,

32:22.320 --> 32:27.360
 and it was risk factor analysis for hospital admission following severe acute respiratory

32:27.360 --> 32:34.080
 syndrome, coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2, monoclonal antibody treatment. And this was really looking

32:34.080 --> 32:40.320
 at timing. If we get those monoclonals in earlier, does that give us better bang for our buck?

32:40.320 --> 32:45.680
 So we look at this whole like less, you know, seven to 10 days after symptom onset, 70 to 80%

32:45.680 --> 32:50.640
 reduction. But are we going to get even more reduction if we get them in the first few days?

32:50.640 --> 32:54.880
 So here they're looking at patients that received what they say is early. So within

32:54.880 --> 33:00.480
 days one through five of symptom onset and comparing those to people who received them late,

33:00.480 --> 33:07.680
 six to 12. And so here we were seeing getting the MAB infusion in the first five days resulted

33:07.680 --> 33:16.560
 in a 54% reduction in progression relative to those folks that get them late. So with the monoclonal

33:16.560 --> 33:22.240
 timing matters, I know a lot of centers closed down over the weekend. A bit of a tragedy right

33:22.240 --> 33:27.520
 person that's diagnosed on a Friday evening and they can't get treated until Monday or Tuesday,

33:27.520 --> 33:34.400
 right? So we really need to focus on timing here of the patients that received the monoclonals

33:34.400 --> 33:40.960
 in days one through three, none zero experienced disease progression. So sooner is better.

33:40.960 --> 33:47.440
 We're hoping this translates in the oral antiretrovirals as well. See my antiretroviral slit,

33:47.440 --> 33:52.800
 my world of HIV is coming back. But yeah, we're really hoping sooner can make more of a difference

33:52.800 --> 34:02.720
 than later. All right, everybody, MISC, MISC, and MISC-A, remember those multi-system inflammatory

34:02.720 --> 34:08.800
 syndrome? So we have actually finally got a little bit of guidance on treatment coming out

34:08.800 --> 34:16.960
 in a publication of peer reviewed article, IVIG compared to IVIG plus inflexumab in multi-system

34:16.960 --> 34:22.080
 inflammatory syndrome in children. This was published in pediatrics, the official journal

34:22.080 --> 34:28.720
 of the American Academy of Pediatrics. This was a retrospective cohort study of 72 patients with

34:28.720 --> 34:35.920
 MISC-C and they're looking at IVIG alone versus IVIG plus inflexumab, right? So this is going to

34:35.920 --> 34:42.320
 neutralize the TNF alpha. Basically what I'm going to just nutshell this here, they were looking at

34:42.320 --> 34:50.800
 better outcomes in the children that got remikade, the inflexumab added to their IVIG. They reported

34:50.800 --> 34:56.480
 that patients with MISC-C compared to those with IVIG alone were less likely to require any

34:56.480 --> 35:03.040
 additional therapy, decreased ICU length of stay, decreased development of left ventricular

35:03.040 --> 35:09.200
 cardiac dysfunction, more rapid decline in their C-reactive protein, so following inflammatory markers.

35:10.400 --> 35:14.880
 All right, a couple exciting things here on long COVID. I feel like I'm going a little long today.

35:14.880 --> 35:22.320
 COVID is not just a two-week viral illness for many people. First, as of October 1st, we now have

35:22.320 --> 35:32.240
 an official code for post acute sequelae of COVID-19. This is U09.9 post COVID-19 condition

35:32.240 --> 35:40.720
 unspecified. Going forward, we'll have subsets. Also some exciting data on the impact of vaccination

35:40.720 --> 35:47.520
 on long COVID, the article efficacy of COVID-19 vaccination on the symptoms of patients with

35:47.520 --> 35:56.000
 long COVID, a target trial emulation using data from the COM pair, that's capital P capital R,

35:56.000 --> 36:03.440
 E cohort in France. This was posted on Lancet as a pre-print. So the authors used data from this

36:03.440 --> 36:10.880
 long COVID cohort. This was a cohort in France. Vaccinated patients were matched to unvaccinated

36:10.880 --> 36:17.280
 controls in a one-to-one ratio by using their propensity scores. And they looked at outcomes

36:17.280 --> 36:24.720
 120 days after baseline. They looked at the disease severity. So you have 455 patients in

36:24.720 --> 36:32.560
 the vaccine group, 455 in the control group, and what did they find? They reported that by 120

36:32.560 --> 36:39.120
 days, vaccination was associated with a reduction in long COVID symptoms. They saw double the rate

36:39.120 --> 36:45.920
 of patients in complete remission. They saw a reduced disease impact on patients' lives

36:45.920 --> 36:51.920
 and the proportion of patients with an unacceptable symptom score. So this is encouraging. Remember,

36:51.920 --> 36:58.240
 this is, and we probably will never get a randomized placebo control trial. There's always the concern

36:58.240 --> 37:03.200
 that there was some sort of a placebo effect. Also, people got vaccinated and unvaccinated.

37:03.200 --> 37:09.280
 They're not exactly matched. But this is something that is consistent with our clinical experience,

37:10.000 --> 37:14.560
 where we're treating hundreds, thousands of folks. And we're seeing this report

37:15.920 --> 37:22.560
 encouraging. But what about Beckadysm, right? That's what we scientists care about. We do want

37:22.560 --> 37:27.280
 our patients to get better, but we also like to know what is going on. And just, we're going to

37:27.280 --> 37:33.360
 close with a couple articles on some insights into mechanisms. The peer-reviewed article,

37:33.360 --> 37:39.360
 persistent clotting protein pathology in long COVID, post-acute sequelae of COVID-19, PASK

37:40.160 --> 37:45.360
 is accompanied by increased levels of anti-plasmid. Now, this was published in the Journal

37:45.360 --> 37:51.520
 Cardiovascular Diapatology. This is not a journal I usually read, and I'm not as familiar with some

37:51.520 --> 37:58.000
 of the platelet activation studies that they did. But basically, going through the suggestion here

37:58.000 --> 38:05.440
 was that hypercoagulability, a persistent hypercoagulability was being driven by inflammatory molecules,

38:05.440 --> 38:12.080
 circulating microclots, hyperactivated platelets, issues with the fibrolinic system.

38:13.120 --> 38:18.320
 And then the speculation here, which requires further study, is that with clotting pathologies

38:18.320 --> 38:24.080
 involved, maybe some anti-clotting therapies can have an impact on long COVID. So hopefully,

38:24.080 --> 38:31.280
 this will give us some sense of what to do going forward. COVID toes, right? Remember COVID toes?

38:31.280 --> 38:36.560
 I have special socks with COVID toes. The article Type 1 Interferon Response and

38:36.560 --> 38:42.960
 Vascular Alteration in Chilblain-like lesions during the COVID-19 outbreak was published in the

38:42.960 --> 38:49.920
 British Journal of Dermatology. This was an observational study conducted 9 through 16 April

38:49.920 --> 38:58.880
 2020 at Son-Louis Hospital in Paris, France. 50 patients referred with chilblain-like lesions

38:58.880 --> 39:05.600
 were seen during the period of the COVID-19 pandemic included in this study. They were comparing the

39:05.600 --> 39:11.200
 skin and blood endothelial and immune cell activation in the chilblain-like lesions

39:11.200 --> 39:18.640
 in these COVID folks to seasonal chilblains that were cold-induced sporadic chilblains.

39:18.640 --> 39:24.560
 They reported that they found chilblain-like lesions were characterized in the COVID folks,

39:24.560 --> 39:31.120
 higher IgA tissue deposition, more significant transcriptomic activation of complement and

39:31.120 --> 39:38.640
 angiogenesis factors. They reported systemic immune response associated with IgA anti-neutrophil,

39:38.640 --> 39:45.280
 cytoplasmic antibodies and 73% of patients and elevated Type 1 interferon blood signature

39:45.920 --> 39:52.960
 compared to healthy controls. They found blood biomarkers which they reported related to endothelial

39:52.960 --> 39:59.520
 dysfunction and activation, angiogenesis, endothelial progenitor cell mobilization,

40:00.160 --> 40:05.760
 really supporting in their analysis a role for endothelial dysfunction in the chilblain-like

40:05.760 --> 40:12.320
 lesions. So very, very interesting. This is something that actually I think a lot of the nurses

40:12.320 --> 40:16.960
 noticed early on. They're spending a little more time than the physicians looking at the

40:16.960 --> 40:22.080
 patients, something that was seen in the outpatient setting as well. So just interesting that we're

40:22.080 --> 40:27.120
 starting to get a little science to maybe help us understand. I like to close by saying no one

40:27.120 --> 40:31.920
 is safe until everyone is safe. We are going to continue during the months of August, September

40:31.920 --> 40:38.400
 and October to donations made to parasites without borders, doubled and going to support

40:38.400 --> 40:42.560
 floating doctors with their efforts down in Central America. So drop what you're doing,

40:42.560 --> 40:48.160
 go to parasiteswithoutborders.com, click on donate and help us continue to do our work

40:48.160 --> 40:53.680
 and help us to support this organization. Time for some email questions for Daniel.

40:53.680 --> 41:00.240
 You can send yours to Daniel at microbe.tv. Lisa is a nurse practitioner, a pediatric nurse

41:00.240 --> 41:06.080
 practitioner who writes, I agree, kids are at risk. The decision made by adults responsible for

41:06.080 --> 41:10.400
 protecting them. Sadly, too often put them at higher risk than they need to be. While numbers

41:10.400 --> 41:15.600
 here in Florida are finally beginning to trend down, they remain much too high. We are in the middle

41:15.600 --> 41:23.920
 of a mask debate with a local chiropractor handing out blank, signed medical mask exemptions after

41:23.920 --> 41:29.200
 a very contentious school board meeting in which our county school board instituted a mask mandate

41:29.200 --> 41:35.040
 in defiance of our governor's ban on this. Parents continue to show up in front of our

41:35.040 --> 41:41.440
 schools with signs that making our kid wear masks is child abuse. Parents and children too often

41:41.440 --> 41:47.760
 refuse to abide by our request that they wear masks in our office. And now our new state

41:47.760 --> 41:54.960
 surgeon general who says he is rejecting fear over COVID mania has decided that as long as they

41:54.960 --> 41:58.960
 are feeling well, our school children, many of whom of course are unable to be vaccinated or

41:58.960 --> 42:04.160
 if they are able or not, no longer need the quarantine or test simply because they've been

42:04.160 --> 42:11.120
 exposed to this pesky little virus. I am curious as to your opinion on this brilliant public health

42:11.120 --> 42:18.160
 policy. Yeah, I'm horrified actually just to be frank. I mean, you know, when you see like the

42:18.160 --> 42:22.880
 movies, right, there's always like the physician who can outrank the general, you can't do that

42:22.880 --> 42:29.520
 because of this health issue and somehow in the real world. There's no under that outranking going

42:29.520 --> 42:36.320
 on. Yes, 18 months ago, there was this myth that started to be spread that children were not

42:36.320 --> 42:41.280
 at risk of COVID. Well, children don't get COVID. Well, they're not at risk of COVID. But now that

42:41.280 --> 42:47.200
 we saw children getting exposed to COVID, we saw hundreds of thousands of children getting infected

42:47.200 --> 42:52.160
 per week. We saw thousands of children ending up in the hospital. We see children, multiple

42:52.160 --> 42:57.200
 children dying every week. There really has to be a certain point when you start off with no

42:57.200 --> 43:02.960
 children are at risk of COVID, children can die of COVID, children can get hospitalized with COVID,

43:02.960 --> 43:10.400
 children can develop long COVID with long term disabilities. Yes, this is a horrible thing to

43:10.400 --> 43:14.640
 let happen to our children. And we don't really know what are going to be the long term effects

43:14.640 --> 43:20.720
 of having been infected with this horrible virus. The second is we do know things that work,

43:20.720 --> 43:25.600
 things that reduce our risk. You shouldn't have to choose between education and safety for your

43:25.600 --> 43:29.760
 children. A child shouldn't have to choose between education and safety. We know how to keep our

43:29.760 --> 43:35.040
 children safe. Wearing a mask is something that parents complain a lot more about than children.

43:35.600 --> 43:39.920
 A lot of children actually kind of like the masks with the different designs and maybe it's become

43:39.920 --> 43:46.800
 an accessory. I just really think we have to step back and take this out of the political arena.

43:46.800 --> 43:51.360
 This is not a partisan issue. This is not a political thing. This should not be something that gets

43:51.360 --> 43:57.200
 you reelected. What should get you reelected and what should get you support is protecting our

43:57.200 --> 44:01.520
 children, helping them get educated safely. And we know how to do that. We keep talking about all

44:01.520 --> 44:07.120
 the data behind that. Michelle writes, I'm in a quandary trying to decide what the best option

44:07.120 --> 44:12.960
 for my daughter is. She turns 12 in January. She's 61 inches tall, 150 pounds. So she's the size

44:12.960 --> 44:18.160
 of a small adult. She tends to school in which masks are only optional. Most kids are not wearing

44:18.160 --> 44:23.200
 them. My concern is whether to get my daughter vaccinated in late fall with the children's dose

44:23.200 --> 44:30.720
 or wait until January for the adult dose. Yeah, I mean, I have to say we've talked about this about

44:30.720 --> 44:34.560
 this is perfect, right? Is that person right on the line? There's going to be no judgment. It's

44:34.560 --> 44:38.720
 going to be this is the day it happens. But you know, this is even true with influenza. I have a

44:38.720 --> 44:45.120
 colleague who's a hematology oncologist and he was turning city turned 65 today. So happy birthday

44:45.120 --> 44:51.920
 Bruce. And Bruce went to get his hired dose because they're still using the egg based vaccine at the

44:51.920 --> 44:57.600
 healthcare system. So he wanted to get the over 65 high dose because they're not using the cell

44:57.600 --> 45:02.880
 based flu vaccine. And they said, I'm sorry, you know, it's Friday, your birthday is not until

45:02.880 --> 45:10.240
 Thursday. You can't get it today. You'll have to come back when you turn 65. So it's interesting.

45:10.240 --> 45:15.520
 People are pretty rigid about this stuff. The children all across look to be getting a really

45:15.520 --> 45:21.280
 robust response with the lower dose. I would say don't don't wait. Don't miss an opportunity to

45:21.280 --> 45:26.640
 vaccinate. Don't miss an opportunity to give your child that protection. If it turns out in the

45:26.640 --> 45:33.600
 future, you know, boosters are recommended for, you know, individuals as we get more information

45:33.600 --> 45:39.520
 about correlates of immunity. But yeah, let's I would encourage you to go ahead and when your

45:39.520 --> 45:48.080
 child is eligible, go ahead and get the proper dose for that age. Daniel writes in New South Wales,

45:48.080 --> 45:53.040
 Australia at the moment, there are a number of people in ICU and dying after full vaccination.

45:53.040 --> 45:58.080
 I know this is to be expected. But I feel that discussion of this is avoided and leads my older

45:58.080 --> 46:02.560
 friends, particularly to feel confused and helpless. All the people who have died here post

46:02.560 --> 46:08.640
 vaccine have been in their 80s and 90s. They have also all had other underlying issues.

46:08.640 --> 46:13.520
 But the underlying issues are never reported. My understanding of why this would occur at all

46:13.520 --> 46:18.800
 is that the individual was unable to mount an immune response to the vaccine. Not that the

46:18.800 --> 46:25.360
 vaccine has weakness, but the individual. Is this correct? Are these are there young healthy people

46:25.360 --> 46:31.520
 who make no immune response and are protected for some reason? Is there a specific list of age

46:31.520 --> 46:36.880
 plus underlying conditions that people can look at and clearly understand their level of risk?

46:38.720 --> 46:44.400
 So yes, I actually feel like you're right on with this. We talked about the vaccines reducing

46:44.400 --> 46:49.360
 your risk of death by, I'm going to say 30, right? We'll pick that as a number. You hate to pick one

46:49.360 --> 46:54.880
 study, but that seems to be reasonable. So if you went from your risk, you're 90 years old,

46:54.880 --> 46:59.120
 you're obese, you have diabetes, you have Down syndrome, right? Let's stack them all together.

46:59.120 --> 47:06.080
 If your risk was 60% that you were going to die if you got COVID, well, that you take 60

47:06.080 --> 47:10.240
 divided by 30, you still have a 2%. You still have a one in 50 chance of dying.

47:10.240 --> 47:16.880
 My wife and I were talking yesterday, we're out walking the dogs. And I was saying, Jessica,

47:16.880 --> 47:23.440
 when you get this reduction, so you've got your vaccine, you're now at 95% reduction

47:23.440 --> 47:28.480
 for ending up in hospital, when you started off, you're in your 40s, your ideal body weight,

47:28.480 --> 47:32.800
 you exercise, you have no, you started off with maybe a 1%, and now you're down to

47:32.800 --> 47:42.960
 5% of 1%, incredibly low. So this is that risk reduction. People think, oh my gosh, 95% reduction.

47:42.960 --> 47:47.760
 That means 5% of people are going to end up in the hospital. No, you have to take your baseline risk,

47:47.760 --> 47:53.360
 and this is a reduction below that. So yes, we are going to see a couple people a day here in the

47:53.360 --> 47:58.960
 US, right? Large country who are vaccinated and still end up dying, but we're going to see thousands

47:58.960 --> 48:02.960
 who are unvaccinated end up in the hospital and dying. We're also going to see a certain

48:02.960 --> 48:07.840
 percent of people who are vaccinated end up in the hospital, but that's going to be a 30-fold,

48:07.840 --> 48:14.160
 or a 10-fold reduction in that number. So that's really, you're really hitting right on it.

48:14.160 --> 48:19.200
 This is a reduction in baseline risk. So yeah, who are going to be those people who still end

48:19.200 --> 48:23.120
 up in the hospital? It's going to be predominantly older individuals. It's going to be predominantly

48:23.120 --> 48:28.320
 individuals with a lot of comorbidities. And those people that do die, they're going to be those

48:28.320 --> 48:36.160
 individuals who have the highest risk factors. And finally, Helen is the parent of a 34-year-old

48:36.160 --> 48:42.720
 adult with down. She has had two Pfizer vaccines, wondering if there are any data on how well people

48:42.720 --> 48:48.160
 would down respond to the vaccines. The order is in a day program where everyone's vaccinated,

48:48.160 --> 48:53.600
 but she's still concerned. Yeah, no, that's an excellent question. And I think you hit on one of

48:53.600 --> 48:59.120
 the things that I touched on there. A down syndrome is a significant risk factor for hospitalization

48:59.120 --> 49:03.920
 and death. I think it's about a 10-fold. It was a British medical journal article in September,

49:03.920 --> 49:07.920
 where they were looking at these. Actually, it's a great article, British medical journal. I think

49:07.920 --> 49:12.240
 it was the 17th of September, the article came out, where they were looking at all these different

49:12.240 --> 49:17.840
 factors. Down syndrome was about a 10-fold increase risk of death. So when they talked about populations

49:17.840 --> 49:22.400
 that they felt were at increased risk, when they started talking about the Pfizer booster,

49:22.400 --> 49:28.000
 down syndrome was one of those thrown in there. So yeah, individuals with all these different

49:28.000 --> 49:32.720
 comorbidities, particularly down syndrome are at increased risk. What about response to the

49:32.720 --> 49:38.160
 vaccine? I haven't really seen any really good data looking specifically at individuals with

49:38.160 --> 49:41.920
 the down syndrome response, but put it in that context of the overall risk.

49:43.440 --> 49:49.040
 That's COVID-19 clinical update number 83 with Dr. Daniel Griffin. Thank you, Daniel.

49:49.040 --> 49:54.240
 Oh, thank you. And be safe. And I say that to all those kids have to go to school without masks.

49:54.240 --> 50:19.680
 Be as safe as you can.
