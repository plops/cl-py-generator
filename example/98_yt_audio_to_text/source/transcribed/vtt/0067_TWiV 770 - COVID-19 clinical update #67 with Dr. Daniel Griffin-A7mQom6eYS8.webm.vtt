 This week in virology, the podcast about viruses, the kind that make you sick.

00:10.400 --> 00:22.320
 From Microbe TV, this is Twiv. This week in virology, episode 770, recorded on June 17, 2021.

00:22.320 --> 00:27.200
 I'm Vincent Rackenjello, and you're listening to the podcast all about viruses.

00:27.200 --> 00:33.040
 Joining me today from New York, Daniel Griffin. Hello, everyone.

00:34.080 --> 00:40.960
 Now, 770 is not a plane, isn't Daniel, right? But I like that number. It's a nice, easy to

00:40.960 --> 00:47.920
 remember, 770. We'll have to see, do I end up hitting 777? Boy, would that be lucky.

00:47.920 --> 00:53.520
 Yeah, that's the big one. I've flown, I flew one of those to Singapore once,

00:53.520 --> 00:58.480
 it's amazing plane. It really quiet. No, I miss that. I miss traveling. I miss

01:00.000 --> 01:04.800
 getting to all these places. I miss my friends in Panama in Uganda.

01:05.920 --> 01:12.000
 Yeah, you miss your cows in Uganda, right? Yes, I do. I'm worried they're not going to

01:12.000 --> 01:16.960
 recognize me. And the next time I go in there, instead of getting like nuzzled by Brian,

01:16.960 --> 01:21.760
 he might get a horn or something. Yeah, they won't remember you. Yeah, you got to go back.

01:21.760 --> 01:27.680
 Maybe next year, you'll be able to go, right? I'm hoping. I'm going to be heading to Ghana in

01:27.680 --> 01:32.960
 January, and I hope to be able to figure out a time to get to Uganda. But I have to say,

01:32.960 --> 01:38.080
 my friend Titus, who's in Blantire, Malawi, is actually saying things are not so great down

01:38.080 --> 01:43.840
 there. They're starting to see what for them is a third surge. So tough times.

01:43.840 --> 01:48.240
 Not a lot of vaccination in Africa, right? No, and actually that's what I'm hearing,

01:48.240 --> 01:51.120
 is they're having issues with they were allocated certain amounts, and now they're

01:51.120 --> 01:54.560
 getting less than even they were allocated, which are already small amounts to begin with.

01:54.560 --> 02:00.640
 So it's tough times for my friends there. Well, maybe we can give them our Novavax stockpile,

02:00.640 --> 02:06.160
 right? I hope so, actually. Yeah, I think that would be great. All right, well, we've got a lot

02:06.160 --> 02:11.040
 to cover today. I remember a few weeks ago, my dad was asking me, really? Is there something new

02:11.040 --> 02:20.080
 every week about COVID? And actually, I was on the local news channel on Monday morning

02:20.080 --> 02:24.400
 with Elizabeth Heshigan. And actually, she told me at the end, she said she has never gotten

02:24.400 --> 02:30.240
 more questions during an appearance than she got during the time I was on. So people have

02:30.240 --> 02:37.120
 lots of questions about COVID. So let's start answering them. So let me start with our quotation.

02:38.080 --> 02:43.120
 The worst thing we can do right now would be to mistake progress for victory.

02:43.120 --> 02:50.880
 And that is our own Andy Slavitt. Andy Slavitt is actually known as the fixer, I say our own,

02:50.880 --> 02:57.440
 because he was one of our executives at Optum for a while out in Minnesota. And he was really

02:57.440 --> 03:04.080
 instrumental, I think, in a very successful vaccine rollout. But he's actually now going to be a

03:04.080 --> 03:09.840
 competing podcaster, Vincent. In the bubble is his podcast. I listened to it regularly,

03:09.840 --> 03:15.440
 and I will shout out. It's great. Good stuff. All right, let me give a little bit of an update.

03:16.320 --> 03:22.080
 Case rates and deaths are down across the country, getting lower here in New York. We've gotten

03:22.080 --> 03:27.600
 over 70% vaccination coverage in New York, not quite as good as 80% up in Vermont,

03:28.640 --> 03:34.080
 but still some hotspots. I think everyone is aware of this. And at the risk of controversial,

03:34.080 --> 03:39.520
 this tends to correspond with low vaccination rates. Maybe people think there's causality there.

03:40.640 --> 03:46.800
 And worldwide, again, it really seems like the same situation. We're seeing numbers come down,

03:46.800 --> 03:52.080
 but again, certain areas and again, seems to be corresponding with areas with low access to

03:52.080 --> 03:59.120
 vaccinations or low vaccine uptake. We're also seeing another variant, the Delta variant.

03:59.120 --> 04:04.240
 And this has been sort of interesting. One of the things that was suggested, and we'll hit a

04:04.240 --> 04:09.760
 little bit on this, is that maybe this is a little bit harder to distinguish from other viral infections.

04:09.760 --> 04:15.120
 Maybe there's a slight difference in clinical presentation, and we'll hit, it's actually the

04:15.120 --> 04:22.720
 Scots in the UK is actually an app, the Zoe app in the UK, where when they're looking at symptom

04:22.720 --> 04:27.520
 reporting, it looks like they're seeing more sore throats, more runny noses, less of the

04:27.520 --> 04:32.640
 classic presentation. Now, I do a call every week with our urgent care docs. I'm sure some of them

04:32.640 --> 04:38.000
 are listening. And among our adult populations, I don't think there's enough of the Delta variant

04:38.000 --> 04:43.200
 out there that they've really noticed much difference. But last night, it was on a call with Jay

04:43.200 --> 04:49.200
 Berger, the head of our large pediatric group. And they're actually still seeing COVID cases

04:49.200 --> 04:55.200
 every week. And he was actually saying, in that population, it's always presented with more of a

04:55.200 --> 05:01.040
 sore throat, runny nose. So I don't know if it's so much a variant presenting clinically differently,

05:01.040 --> 05:05.680
 or if it's just that people are now seeing it in a younger age group, which for I'll say for the

05:05.680 --> 05:10.960
 whole pandemic has always presented in a way really difficult to distinguish. And this is a

05:10.960 --> 05:16.000
 question I remember like a year plus ago is actually Dr. Mench, one of the medical directors at a

05:16.000 --> 05:19.920
 hospital. And he was going through asking all kinds of questions about, well, how can we tell

05:19.920 --> 05:23.280
 whether or not it's COVID versus something else? And I was like, you know what, Dr. Mench,

05:23.280 --> 05:29.760
 there is one test. It's called the PCR. And I think we're still there. So a lot of attention

05:29.760 --> 05:35.040
 back to the early days of the pandemic, which I hope will position us better for the next

05:35.040 --> 05:41.200
 zoonotic pandemic. You know, and a lot of this is when when did when did COVID-19 get

05:41.760 --> 05:48.320
 into our country? So one of the publications antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in all of us research

05:48.320 --> 05:54.560
 program participants January 2 through March 18, 2020. And this really builds on other work,

05:54.560 --> 05:59.600
 including David Hose, serology surveys here in New York City, Washington Heights, Columbia.

06:00.240 --> 06:05.680
 And these authors used serum obtained as part of the all of us research program.

06:05.680 --> 06:11.840
 This is an observational cohort study that beginning in May 2018 enrolled diverse adults

06:11.840 --> 06:18.080
 greater than 18 years of age in the United States from study site locations in all 50 states,

06:18.080 --> 06:24.400
 with a goal of enrolling at least a million participants. So relying on serology testing,

06:24.400 --> 06:31.600
 these authors reported that they found positive serology for SARS-CoV-2 as early as January 7th

06:31.600 --> 06:38.400
 from Illinois, January 8th from Massachusetts, February 3rd from Wisconsin, February 15th from

06:38.400 --> 06:43.840
 Pennsylvania, March 6th in Mississippi. And this is really consistent with the paper published

06:43.840 --> 06:49.760
 back in the fall serology testing of US blood donations to identify severe acute

06:49.760 --> 06:56.960
 respiratory syndrome, coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2, reactive antibodies, December 2019 through January

06:56.960 --> 07:03.920
 2020 and CID. And that actually they have reported in that paper on SARS-CoV-2 reactive antibodies

07:03.920 --> 07:10.560
 saying they had detected them in 106 blood donations from California, Oregon, and Washington

07:10.560 --> 07:18.320
 as early as 13 through 16 December 2019. And among donations occurring in early January in

07:18.320 --> 07:23.680
 Connecticut, Iowa, Massachusetts, Michigan, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin. So I think this

07:24.720 --> 07:29.280
 really goes back, right? I mean, this keeps coming up. They keep talking about the identification

07:29.280 --> 07:34.880
 of this in Wuhan, China. And I hate to say when they identified it in Wuhan, China in December,

07:34.880 --> 07:40.640
 it was already here in our country, it looks like. So maybe we should take off our hat and say,

07:40.640 --> 07:44.960
 thank you for picking up that something was going on because we had it here in our country already.

07:46.000 --> 07:51.120
 There actually was a frontline special, PBS frontline special, the virus, what went wrong.

07:51.760 --> 07:56.160
 And you can actually hear the story there. And this was made about a year ago about how here we

07:56.160 --> 08:00.960
 were in the United States, seeing lots of patients with unexplained respiratory infections.

08:00.960 --> 08:05.040
 We were seeing them in community. We were seeing people dying in the hospitals.

08:05.040 --> 08:09.520
 We had suspicions that something was going on. We were desperate to be able to sort this out,

08:09.520 --> 08:14.320
 but we had no access to testing. We weren't really able to confirm it and tell us the story here

08:14.320 --> 08:19.680
 about how it's actually that Westchester patient that we finally were able to get a test result

08:19.680 --> 08:24.560
 on February 29th. But he had been sick for a while. And we sort of later realized, boy,

08:24.560 --> 08:29.520
 there were thousands of people that already had COVID-19 here in New York by the time we identified

08:29.520 --> 08:34.720
 that gentleman in the end of February. Children in COVID, children are at low risk, but they are

08:34.720 --> 08:40.400
 not at no risk. And I know people remember my old mantra, let us open the schools if we need to

08:40.400 --> 08:46.000
 close the bars. That's fine. So more on children in COVID. And this will be a little bit of an

08:46.000 --> 08:53.840
 overlap from, I guess, 769-12, which covered a little bit new information on the article.

08:54.400 --> 08:59.440
 This article I'll be talking about incidents of multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children.

08:59.440 --> 09:06.160
 Among U.S. persons infected with SARS-CoV-2. This paper was published in JAMA Network Open,

09:06.160 --> 09:13.520
 but there's really nice discussion on 769. Not only just about this issue, but maybe a little

09:13.520 --> 09:21.920
 deeper dive into maybe some ideas about gut-tight junctions and super antigens. But this article

09:21.920 --> 09:30.720
 was really a look at the incidence of multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children. So Miss C,

09:30.720 --> 09:36.560
 in those under 21, should they get COVID? So they looked at data from Connecticut,

09:36.560 --> 09:40.960
 Georgia, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York. They excluded New York City,

09:41.840 --> 09:49.040
 Pennsylvania. And the data analysis was conducted from August to December 2020. And they actually

09:49.040 --> 09:57.200
 reported an incidence of 31.6 persons per 100,000 SARS-CoV-2 infections in persons younger than 21.

09:57.760 --> 10:05.200
 So this is about one in every 3,000 children who got COVID ended up with Miss C. They did point

10:05.200 --> 10:11.120
 out that the Miss C incidence among black persons, Hispanics, and Latino persons was approximately

10:11.120 --> 10:17.760
 nine times higher than among Caucasians, about three times higher among Asian Pacific Islanders.

10:17.760 --> 10:23.280
 And so I'll suggest this perhaps a lower risk, right? Because as we've discussed before,

10:23.280 --> 10:27.920
 many cases in children do go undiagnosed. I just want to add that caveat. But we're starting to

10:27.920 --> 10:33.200
 get a, I think, information here, because parents are trying to decide, should I just wait and let

10:33.200 --> 10:40.000
 my child get COVID versus the risk that might be associated with vaccinations? So just putting

10:40.000 --> 10:46.720
 that in context. Another paper, and this is going to help us with myocarditis discussions,

10:46.720 --> 10:51.840
 this paper was prevalence of clinical and subclinical myocarditis in competitive

10:51.840 --> 10:57.760
 athletes with recent SARS-CoV-2 infection results from the Big 10 COVID-19 cardiac

10:57.760 --> 11:04.480
 registry, right? So this is our university athletes. We'd heard a little bit about this in preprint,

11:04.480 --> 11:09.840
 but now this was published in JAMA cardiology. And I think this can give us some perspective,

11:09.840 --> 11:15.120
 as concerns are raised about potential risks of heart inflammation or myocarditis post-vaccination.

11:15.120 --> 11:23.600
 So the authors here report on a cohort study of 1,597 U.S. competitive collegiate athletes

11:24.160 --> 11:30.800
 undergoing comprehensive cardiovascular testing and the prevalence of clinical myocarditis based

11:30.800 --> 11:38.720
 on a symptom screening strategy was 0.31%. If they went ahead and screened with magnetic

11:38.720 --> 11:46.240
 resonance imaging, it actually was as high as 2.3%. So this gives us a 1 in 300 chance of

11:46.240 --> 11:52.240
 symptomatic myocarditis and about a 1 in 43 chance with sensitive screening should

11:53.200 --> 11:59.920
 individual in this age group get COVID. So as I say, this is perhaps a lower risk,

11:59.920 --> 12:06.000
 because right as we discussed right above, some cases go undiagnosed, so got to have that caveat.

12:06.000 --> 12:12.320
 But I think this gives us perspective to concerns about the post-vaccination myocarditis risk,

12:12.960 --> 12:19.040
 of which there are a few hundred cases under investigation. They tend to be mild limited to a

12:19.040 --> 12:24.880
 few days versus what we see with the virus here, which has actually resulted in long-term impacts.

12:24.880 --> 12:29.440
 We actually know a lot of athletes who actually were not able to actually compete because of the

12:29.440 --> 12:35.760
 severity of a post-COVID infection myocarditis. So I think this is just more information

12:35.760 --> 12:41.120
 for people to have in the mix when they're making decisions about vaccination. I'm talking my

12:41.120 --> 12:46.080
 wife a little bit about the sort of discouraging fact that we're still seeing thousands of COVID

12:46.080 --> 12:52.320
 cases every day. Most experts are predicting an increase come fall and winter. So you compare

12:52.320 --> 13:00.000
 the risk potential risks associated with vaccination versus the real risks of getting COVID and the

13:00.000 --> 13:04.240
 complications that we know about from that. But then balancing the risk and perspectives,

13:04.240 --> 13:10.720
 what about the impact of the pandemic on mental health issues here in our adolescents? The

13:10.720 --> 13:17.760
 article emergency department visits for suspected suicide attempts among persons age 12 to 25 years

13:18.320 --> 13:26.160
 before and during the COVID-19 pandemic United States January 2019 through May 2021. Now this

13:26.160 --> 13:33.520
 came out as an early release in the CDC MMWR and the authors reported that in May 2020,

13:33.520 --> 13:39.200
 during the COVID-19 pandemic ED visits for suspected suicide attempts began to increase

13:39.200 --> 13:48.080
 among adolescents age 12 to 17, especially girls. And during February 21 to March 2021,

13:48.080 --> 13:55.200
 suspected suicide attempt ED visits were 50.6% higher among girls age 12 to 17 than during the

13:55.200 --> 14:01.040
 same period in 2019 prior to the pandemic. And I really think that if you look at

14:01.040 --> 14:05.840
 figure one in this paper, it's very sobering as one can see the weekly ER visits for female

14:05.840 --> 14:12.400
 adolescents with suspected suicide attempts rising to over 1000 per week. Now the authors

14:12.400 --> 14:18.160
 acknowledge several limitations. First, you know, my first tendency is feel guilty that we

14:18.160 --> 14:22.400
 caused this through physical distancing, including a lack of connectedness to schools,

14:22.400 --> 14:28.880
 teachers and peers, barriers to mental health treatment, increases in substance use and anxiety

14:28.880 --> 14:34.320
 about family health and economic problems, which I think we all experienced. These are all risk

14:34.320 --> 14:40.320
 factors just for suicide. But we also have seen that the average ED visits for mental health

14:40.320 --> 14:45.920
 concerns and suspected child abuse, neglect, risk factors for suicide attempts also increased

14:45.920 --> 14:52.080
 in 2020. The authors, you know, acknowledge that there could be alternative explanations here.

14:52.080 --> 14:59.280
 But I've talked a bit with our urgent care physicians. And I think a lot of us, a lot of

14:59.280 --> 15:04.080
 people have suggested that both this was very evident that there was a significant impact on

15:04.080 --> 15:08.720
 mental health that we didn't really need a publication like this. But others have actually

15:08.720 --> 15:14.160
 suggested that there's even a bigger problem than we see here. So many visits to urgent care

15:14.160 --> 15:19.040
 centers with cutting and other results of mental health challenges in our children,

15:19.040 --> 15:23.680
 children struggling in school, parents frustrated and struggling with often very unhealthy parent

15:23.680 --> 15:30.080
 child and even parent dynamics. So I was talking to my friend, Dr. Lucy McBride, sort of a,

15:30.080 --> 15:34.880
 I think, a bright light in this spot over the last year, just about how we really need to do

15:34.880 --> 15:41.200
 better. Alright, pre-exposure period transmission. This was an interesting correspondence in the

15:41.200 --> 15:49.760
 Lancet. SARS-CoV-2 Delta, VOC in Scotland, demographics, risk of hospital admission and vaccine

15:49.760 --> 15:54.800
 effectiveness. Now, the authors use the word strain a bun. So I'm going to replace that with

15:54.800 --> 16:03.600
 the word variant. They report that on May 19, 2021, the Delta variant of concern for 4 million

16:03.600 --> 16:12.480
 known as the Indian VOC or B1.617.2 became the dominant variant of SARS-CoV-2 in Scotland.

16:13.280 --> 16:15.760
 I wonder how long it's been like prints, how long we have to, you know,

16:15.760 --> 16:23.760
 4 million known as throw in there. But the alpha variant of concern had been dominant previously.

16:23.760 --> 16:29.840
 I'm not going to give the AKA there. But this was rapidly replaced. A few interesting findings.

16:29.840 --> 16:36.160
 So the Delta variant of concern in Scotland was found mainly in younger, more affluent groups.

16:36.720 --> 16:42.080
 Interesting. I'm sure about the affluent part of that. Risk of COVID-19 hospital admission was

16:42.080 --> 16:49.680
 approximately doubled in those with the Delta VOC when compared to the alpha VOC. Both the Oxford,

16:49.680 --> 16:55.120
 AstraZeneca, and the Pfizer by intact COVID-19 vaccines were effective in reducing the

16:55.120 --> 17:02.480
 risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 hospitalization in people with the Delta VOC.

17:02.480 --> 17:07.680
 So interesting publication there. All right. Testing never missed an opportunity to test.

17:08.400 --> 17:12.320
 This has become a challenging arena and really dealing with false positives,

17:12.880 --> 17:16.880
 particularly on asymptomatic screening. So we've done this a few times,

17:16.880 --> 17:21.360
 and I'm hoping that clear minds prevail. We get some clinical judgment allowed in terms of

17:21.360 --> 17:29.040
 interpretation for our camp, school, and summer programs. So this is the concept of a positive

17:29.040 --> 17:34.320
 predictive value and a negative predictive value. So the big message here is that when we get to

17:34.320 --> 17:40.240
 a prevalence below 1%, that's where we are in most parts of the country, the majority of those

17:40.240 --> 17:45.600
 positive tests are going to be false positives. We're forced in a lot of jurisdictions to still

17:45.600 --> 17:53.360
 count any test as positive and follow the rigmarole that follows from that. But we're hoping that

17:53.360 --> 17:58.160
 if someone is low-risk, it's screening. You do a secondary confirmatory test that is negative.

17:58.720 --> 18:04.000
 We'd love to have just a little bit of flexibility here to use some clinical judgment. But that

18:04.000 --> 18:08.960
 is actually what I'm spending a lot of time with. Meetings going through, because there will be.

18:08.960 --> 18:14.000
 You do hundreds of tests. You're going to get some positives, and the majority of those are going

18:14.000 --> 18:20.560
 to be false positives. All right, active vaccination. Never miss an opportunity to vaccinate. Vaccines

18:20.560 --> 18:29.200
 are how this pandemic ends. We heard from Novavax. This was covered on 769. The Novavax COVID-19

18:29.200 --> 18:36.160
 vaccine demonstrated 90% overall efficacy and 100% protection against moderate and severe disease

18:36.160 --> 18:44.560
 in prevent-19 phase 3 trial. Press release, so we don't have a full peer-reviewed pre-print. But

18:44.560 --> 18:51.760
 this is a recombinant nanoparticle protein-based COVID-19 vaccine that uses technology similar to

18:51.760 --> 18:59.440
 the current shingles vaccine, shingrix, pertussis, hepatitis B. This, in all honesty, people ask

18:59.440 --> 19:04.800
 for, oh, I want a traditional vaccine in many ways. This is. A little bit about the trial,

19:04.800 --> 19:11.840
 the catchy name, right? Vincent did a good job of that. Provent stands for the pre-fusion protein

19:11.840 --> 19:19.280
 subunit vaccine efficacy Novax trial. This was a two-to-one randomized placebo-controlled

19:19.280 --> 19:27.360
 observer-blinded study to evaluate the safety efficacy immunogenicity of this

19:27.360 --> 19:35.840
 adjuvanted vaccine in 29,960 participants, 18 years of age and older in 119 locations in the

19:35.840 --> 19:42.400
 United States, Mexico, compared with placebo. 70, seven cases were observed, 63 of placebo,

19:42.400 --> 19:47.680
 14 in the vaccine group. So remember, this is two-to-one. So you can sort of think of that 63 versus

19:47.680 --> 19:54.080
 seven, you know, or 126 versus 14, just to understand why the numbers are what they are.

19:54.080 --> 20:00.720
 All cases observed in the vaccine group were mild. 10 moderate cases and four severe cases

20:00.720 --> 20:06.480
 were observed all in the placebo group, yielding a vaccine efficacy of 100% against moderate or

20:06.480 --> 20:12.000
 severe disease. It's all very positive. Safety data was actually quite positive. And at least

20:12.000 --> 20:17.040
 what I have heard is that the people that got the vaccine versus the people that did not get the

20:17.040 --> 20:22.400
 vaccine, the degree of reactogenicity was minor enough that people had a tough time telling. So

20:22.400 --> 20:28.560
 that will be quite nice if we have a vaccine with a little less reactogenicity. I think it'll be

20:28.560 --> 20:32.240
 nice. I'm sure we'll have people wondering if they didn't get placebo in the future. They're

20:32.240 --> 20:36.800
 getting used to a nice big reaction. Now they did give us a little bit of information about

20:36.800 --> 20:43.120
 variants, but I'm going to sort of leave it there. Another potential great tool for us to have that

20:43.120 --> 20:48.880
 looks like it's also efficacious against the variants. All right, pregnant women and vaccination.

20:48.880 --> 20:56.000
 It's always a hot topic. CDC MMWR again with COVID-19 vaccination coverage among pregnant women

20:56.000 --> 21:01.440
 during pregnancy. That was sort of redundant, but okay. Eight integrated healthcare organizations

21:01.440 --> 21:08.080
 U.S. December 14, 2020 through May 8, 2021. And so data from the vaccine safety data link,

21:08.080 --> 21:14.800
 so VSD, a collaboration between CDC and multiple integrated health systems was analyzed to assess

21:14.800 --> 21:21.440
 those that received greater than one dose or first or second dose of Pfizer BioNTech or Moderna or

21:21.440 --> 21:27.440
 single dose of J&J. And basically went through and the really the high point I'm going to say,

21:27.440 --> 21:33.040
 they looked at a total of one thousand three one thousand thirty five one hundred and thirty

21:33.040 --> 21:36.960
 five thousand yes one hundred and thirty five thousand nine hundred and sixty eight pregnant

21:36.960 --> 21:45.520
 women, and they identified no safety concerns. All right, we got more real world data on our

21:45.520 --> 21:51.520
 monoclonals. And I like to say the first week, right, the viral symptom phase, the time for

21:51.520 --> 21:56.320
 monitoring and monoclonals, and also where you get your test is ideally where you get your monoclonals.

21:56.960 --> 22:02.560
 So real world data on bamlin of a map, the article early monoclonal antibody administration

22:02.560 --> 22:09.280
 can reduce both hospitalizations and mortality in high-risk outpatients with COVID-19. This was

22:09.280 --> 22:16.400
 published in in CID out of UC San Diego at La Jolla. The authors performed a retrospective

22:16.400 --> 22:25.520
 review of medical records of patients referred to their clinic from 11 120 to 2 2021 and identified

22:25.520 --> 22:33.920
 617 patients at high risk who were offered monoclonal antibodies 175 received them 442 did not.

22:35.200 --> 22:41.040
 The monoclonal antibody group was older, more men, more comorbidities, higher risk score,

22:41.040 --> 22:46.960
 but despite that there was a significant reduction in hospitalizations in the monoclonal antibody

22:46.960 --> 22:56.160
 group versus control 1.7% versus 24%. No COVID-19 related deaths in the monoclonal antibody group,

22:56.160 --> 23:00.960
 there were 12 among the controls, which really breaks your heart, right? All these people were

23:00.960 --> 23:07.040
 offered monoclonals, a number refused, a dozen of those died as a consequence of that decision.

23:08.000 --> 23:12.320
 So I think it's really important for clinicians and patients to realize that particularly in

23:12.320 --> 23:19.680
 those unvaccinated monoclonals are a really powerful tool. But now things get a little bit

23:19.680 --> 23:26.080
 complicated. This is a twist and I think everyone who is used to everything I've said about monoclonals

23:26.080 --> 23:31.600
 and how timing really matters, this is a little nuanced because now we're going to talk about

23:31.600 --> 23:38.800
 a subset of hospitalized patients that may actually benefit that do benefit from monoclonal. So we

23:38.800 --> 23:43.840
 heard about data from the UK recovery trial. And I have to say, I was very excited about this,

23:43.840 --> 23:47.120
 you know, this is stopping people in the hall at the hospital, we got to talk about this.

23:48.000 --> 23:55.120
 And this was, we got a press release from Regeneron, Regeneron Cove. So this is the

23:55.120 --> 24:01.760
 Casa Veribimab and the MDivimab phase three recovery trial meets primary outcome,

24:01.760 --> 24:08.480
 improving survival in hospitalized COVID-19 patients lacking an immune response to SARS-CoV-2.

24:09.440 --> 24:18.000
 So the primary outcome was all cause mortality in hospitalized zero negative patients. They

24:18.000 --> 24:24.800
 received Regeneron Cove 8000 milligrams versus just usual state of care. And this reduced all

24:24.800 --> 24:35.520
 cause mortality by 20% in zero negative patients compared to usual care alone. So 24% of the folks

24:36.400 --> 24:42.160
 in the Regeneron COVID arm died versus 30% in the usual care by day 28.

24:42.880 --> 24:47.760
 So this is really an important point, right? This is not saying, oh wow, now it works in

24:47.760 --> 24:53.200
 hospitalized patients. This is saying that if you give it to people who end up in the hospital,

24:53.200 --> 24:59.760
 who missed that first window, remember that first window, nobody died. Here, you still had 24%

24:59.760 --> 25:08.240
 of the patients dying. But that was a 20% reduction. When you combine the larger seropositive group,

25:08.240 --> 25:14.160
 there was no longer a significant impact. So this is already something where they are looking

25:14.160 --> 25:19.760
 for expansion of the EUA. So if a patient shows up in the hospital, maybe their oxygen saturation

25:19.760 --> 25:25.440
 is 92, 93, someone might think we need to admit them for a remdesivir or something else. If they

25:25.440 --> 25:31.040
 are seronegative, it looks like there still is a benefit in that subgroup to getting Regeneron

25:31.040 --> 25:37.440
 cocktail therapy. The median hospital stay was four days shorter, 13 versus 17 in those that

25:37.440 --> 25:42.560
 got the cocktail when we're looking at their seronegative group. I'll read there. They had

25:42.560 --> 25:47.680
 that quoted summary and this is the takeaway. The recovery trial has shown that in patients who

25:47.680 --> 25:54.160
 had not made their own antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 treated with Regeneron-CoV antibodies,

25:54.160 --> 26:00.400
 dramatically reduced their risk of dying or being on a ventilator and also shortened how many days

26:00.400 --> 26:08.080
 they remained in the hospital. So I think that this is practice changing. But I still will say,

26:08.080 --> 26:13.120
 if you can get it in in that first week before they end up in the hospital, we are not seeing

26:13.120 --> 26:18.880
 people dying in our trials. We're here a quarter of these people died, but that was less than the

26:18.880 --> 26:25.360
 people who do not receive therapy. Long COVID, post COVID, I feel like we're still in a bit of limbo

26:25.360 --> 26:31.920
 here, still very limited in what we can offer patients. But we did this week get some guidance

26:31.920 --> 26:37.680
 from the CDC. It's both honest, accurate and a start. So let's wrap up today before we get to

26:37.680 --> 26:45.920
 emails with some of the key points from the CDC interim guidance on post-acute sequelae of COVID.

26:45.920 --> 26:52.960
 So key points, the term post-COVID conditions is an umbrella term for the wide range of physical

26:52.960 --> 26:59.120
 and mental health consequences experienced by some patients that are present four or more weeks

26:59.120 --> 27:07.840
 after SARS-CoV-2 infection, including by patients who had initial mild or asymptomatic acute infection.

27:07.840 --> 27:14.000
 Two, based on current information, many post-COVID conditions can be managed by primary care

27:14.000 --> 27:19.840
 providers with the incorporation of patient-centered approaches to optimize the quality of life and

27:19.840 --> 27:25.200
 function in affected patients, right? So they're saying here a lot of these people can be managed

27:25.200 --> 27:29.440
 by their primary conditions. They do not need to be referred to specialty centers.

27:30.400 --> 27:35.920
 The third, and I think this is really important, objective laboratory or imaging finding should

27:35.920 --> 27:42.880
 not be used as the only measure or assessment of a patient's well-being. Lack of laboratory or

27:42.880 --> 27:49.120
 imaging abnormalities does not invalidate the existence, severity or important of a patient's

27:49.120 --> 27:54.800
 symptoms or conditions. I have to admit that particularly one hits close to home. I lately had

27:54.800 --> 28:01.520
 a woman who was severely cognitively impaired and the disability decision was basically,

28:02.080 --> 28:07.040
 there's no objective lab or imaging abnormalities, so we're going to drop her claim and not continue

28:07.040 --> 28:12.800
 to cover her. So I think it's really important that this is recognized. Health care professionals

28:12.800 --> 28:18.000
 and patients are encouraged to set achievable goals through shared decision-making and to

28:18.000 --> 28:23.760
 approach treatment by focusing on specific symptoms. So for example, if they have a headache or

28:23.760 --> 28:30.080
 conditions such as dysautonomia, a comprehensive management plan focusing on improving physical,

28:30.080 --> 28:35.120
 mental and social well-being may be helpful for some patients, but then just the honesty at the

28:35.120 --> 28:40.560
 end. Understanding of post-COVID conditions remains incomplete and guidance for health care

28:40.560 --> 28:46.720
 professionals will likely change over time as the evidence evolves and I'm going to say as we

28:46.720 --> 28:50.880
 understand better what is going on and how to help these individuals. We do actually have quite a

28:50.880 --> 28:55.760
 bit of a challenge. I'm actually in a meeting almost every day trying to look at how to address

28:55.760 --> 29:00.800
 this issue, but we do have challenges because in part it's hard to identify these individuals. We

29:00.800 --> 29:05.760
 don't necessarily have a diagnosis code, so we can't look through claims and say, oh, how many people

29:05.760 --> 29:12.400
 are, you know, suffering from long COVID, but I wasn't a meeting earlier this week hearing that

29:12.400 --> 29:19.520
 there may be a new code. This U09.9 might become active in October and that might allow a physician

29:19.520 --> 29:28.000
 to identify this is a person who not just has a new diagnosis after COVID, but may have this post

29:28.000 --> 29:34.000
 acute sequelae of COVID syndrome that we're all growing familiar with, the brain fog, the fatigue,

29:34.000 --> 29:39.200
 the other disabilities. I will finish there, but then again, thank everyone for your continued

29:39.200 --> 29:43.680
 support. I've noticed lately a lot of people are going to Patreon. It's just sort of setting up for

29:43.680 --> 29:49.680
 a monthly contribution, which thank you so much. We're continuing through May, June, and July.

29:50.320 --> 29:56.960
 Donations made to parasites without borders will be doubled up to a total contribution of $40,000

29:56.960 --> 30:02.480
 to Foundation International Medical Relief of Children. This is really a tremendous organization

30:02.480 --> 30:07.040
 that's out there helping people in the world struggling. We really want to support them because

30:07.040 --> 30:14.160
 we are not safe until everyone is safe. Time for some email questions for Daniel. If you have one,

30:14.160 --> 30:22.000
 you can send it to Daniel at microb.tv. Mark writes, wondering if you have seen any cases of PAM as a

30:22.000 --> 30:28.480
 vascular stage sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection in your practice. PAM. So who knows what PAM is,

30:28.480 --> 30:35.280
 paracetral acute middle maculopathy. So this is actually an issue where you have ischemia

30:35.280 --> 30:42.080
 to part of the eye. So you have retinal capillary ischemia. And a lot of those patients, this is

30:42.080 --> 30:47.280
 well-described, unfortunately, post-COVID. We know that COVID is not just a pulmonary disease. It's a

30:47.280 --> 30:53.040
 vascular disease. There's clotting abnormalities. And so these patients are actually being managed

30:53.040 --> 30:59.520
 by our ophthalmologist at this point. But yeah, this is a quite a challenge and I think just more

30:59.520 --> 31:07.920
 evidence of that COVID is a disease that affects the entire body. So yeah, we actually recently,

31:07.920 --> 31:13.200
 it was actually Tuesday night, we went through, we have a COVID recovery clinic here. We set up

31:13.200 --> 31:18.560
 here at ProHealth. A lot of institutions have set them up. And a lot of what we do at that intake

31:18.560 --> 31:23.600
 is connect patients with specialists that are committed to helping them. So when a person is

31:23.600 --> 31:27.040
 seen with this presentation, we connect them with one of our ophthalmologists.

31:27.040 --> 31:34.400
 Hi, I'm writes with most indoor spaces, rapidly moving to masks optional. What do I need to do

31:34.400 --> 31:39.680
 to best keep my seven-year-old safe? Is his mask enough to protect him, at least for short

31:39.680 --> 31:44.720
 exposures? What about longer, like synagogue services, should we just be keeping him away

31:44.720 --> 31:49.920
 from all public indoor places other than school for the rest of the year until he can get vaccinated?

31:49.920 --> 31:54.960
 So this is an excellent question. I know a lot of people have, you hit on several points in your

31:54.960 --> 32:00.240
 question. And one of them, I think a big issue, is a lot of people have not been going to church

32:00.240 --> 32:05.040
 synagogue mosque over the last year, or I guess wickin' outdoor circles and I'm gonna leave out

32:05.040 --> 32:13.040
 the pagans right there. But you know, there is a risk that has to do with how much virus is in

32:13.040 --> 32:17.920
 your community. And so what we're seeing in a lot of communities is an incredibly low

32:17.920 --> 32:25.920
 prevalence incidence. And so let's take my immediate area where our test positivity rate is less

32:25.920 --> 32:31.440
 than half a percent. These are places where you can start looking around high vaccination rates,

32:31.440 --> 32:35.680
 low incidence of virus. You can start doing a risk calculation. There are other parts of the

32:35.680 --> 32:40.560
 country where I'm gonna give really the opposite advice, low vaccination, still seeing lots of

32:40.560 --> 32:47.040
 infection. So you're gonna have to balance that risk here. The mask really protects us when other

32:47.040 --> 32:51.920
 people wear them. There is some protection you get from wearing it yourself. I sort of think of it

32:51.920 --> 32:56.880
 as the 80-20 rule. You're getting about 20% of that. By you wearing it, you get about 80% if

32:56.880 --> 33:02.080
 everyone else is wearing them. The other is really, as I brought up, vaccination if you're in a place

33:02.080 --> 33:07.680
 where people are vaccinated. And again, it's gonna be a sort of threshold risk tolerance.

33:08.640 --> 33:12.800
 I actually went to the gym yesterday and I took off my mask for the first time. It felt really

33:12.800 --> 33:18.240
 uncomfortable. If I had young children, I think this is really important. Parents need to know

33:18.240 --> 33:22.640
 sort of the risks, need to make decisions they're comfortable with. There's a few months left. We

33:22.640 --> 33:28.880
 think we're gonna be in September having the ability to vaccinate younger individuals. Parents

33:28.880 --> 33:34.640
 should have that as an option. Should they choose it? Come September. So you got to sort of weigh that.

33:35.200 --> 33:39.760
 Alina writes, a question regarding a B cell depleted patient with multiple sclerosis in her

33:39.760 --> 33:46.480
 40s, last infusion of retuximab, February 2021. First dose of Pfizer April, second dose three weeks

33:46.480 --> 33:52.720
 later. In May, some B cells detectable less than 0.5%. Because of a former medication,

33:52.720 --> 33:58.960
 there's a T cell deficiency. T cell responses are going to be tested anyway, as well as lymphopenia.

33:58.960 --> 34:03.280
 She was tested for antibodies three weeks after the second vaccine dose. They were none at all

34:03.280 --> 34:08.800
 detectable. Another round of shots is going to be administered July, hopefully in time before the

34:08.800 --> 34:13.760
 next round of retuximab will be needed. Surgery because of a precancerous disease is at the moment

34:13.760 --> 34:18.800
 being postponed until after vaccination, but has to happen in full this year at the latest.

34:18.800 --> 34:23.680
 Question, what's to be done if the second round of vaccines does not build an immune response?

34:23.680 --> 34:28.720
 Could monoclonals be a temporary solution for her for prevention of COVID in high risk settings

34:28.720 --> 34:33.920
 like during hospitalization, where masking is not possible? Here in Germany, monoclonals are

34:33.920 --> 34:38.400
 not licensed to prevent the use. So there happens to be the practical problem of how to get hold of

34:38.400 --> 34:43.600
 them, even as the patient is willing to pay for all medication import transportation. Any ideas

34:43.600 --> 34:50.400
 are highly appreciated. This is a great question. We brought up several tests before. There are

34:50.400 --> 34:54.560
 millions of patients here in the United States. There are millions and millions of individuals

34:54.560 --> 34:59.120
 throughout the world in very similar situations where they've received the vaccine. They don't

34:59.120 --> 35:03.920
 have detectable antibodies. It's hard to do the T cell test outside of a research setting,

35:03.920 --> 35:09.760
 to be honest. The adaptive T detect is the algorithm for analysis is set up to detect natural

35:09.760 --> 35:14.880
 infection, not great for telling us, are you immune? Do you have a T cell shield, so to speak?

35:16.240 --> 35:21.120
 The double vaccination people are definitely doing, sort of hear that kind of in there.

35:21.760 --> 35:26.720
 A lot of people are giving even at least a third dose. This is all sort of outside. It's

35:26.720 --> 35:32.640
 being actively studied at the moment. COVID is different, I got to say. If a person,

35:32.640 --> 35:38.560
 I was just going over needle stick injuries yesterday with our frontline physicians. We

35:38.560 --> 35:43.920
 tend to say, oh boy, if you were vaccinated and if you have negative serology, then people actually

35:43.920 --> 35:49.360
 get immunoglobulin to protect them after acute. There are some studies. Actually,

35:49.360 --> 35:56.560
 Regeneron published a preventive study. It makes sense. A lot of the monoclonal antibody

35:56.560 --> 36:02.640
 manufacturers are looking at that. Different monoclonal antibodies have different half-lives,

36:02.640 --> 36:08.160
 so it makes sense. There is some data to support that. A lot of it here in the US,

36:08.160 --> 36:13.040
 I'll be able to share when that is part of the EUA for another indication.

36:13.040 --> 36:18.240
 Once something is licensed, as our listeners may know, a physician could choose to use it off-label.

36:19.040 --> 36:23.600
 Germany's going to be a particular different challenge, but that is sort of what we think is

36:23.600 --> 36:28.240
 on the horizon for individuals that can't make their own antibodies. Potentially, we can give them

36:28.240 --> 36:34.640
 those antibodies. And finally, from Jonathan, I'm an internal medicine hospitalist who's getting

36:34.640 --> 36:39.840
 revenge against COVID by administering vaccines. I've been heartened to see our clinics here in

36:39.840 --> 36:44.960
 San Diego fill up with young adolescents for Pfizer vaccine. However, I'm getting questions

36:44.960 --> 36:49.440
 from parents about myocarditis in this population after the vaccine appears that the risk may be

36:49.440 --> 36:55.280
 increased. It appears most cases are mild. However, it often helps to discuss these kinds of things

36:55.280 --> 37:00.720
 in context. What is the underlying rate of myocarditis in this population? What is the relative risk

37:00.720 --> 37:06.560
 of COVID infection versus myocarditis? What are long-term effects or serious outcome percentages

37:06.560 --> 37:12.000
 in kids who get this inflammatory state? I can see a parent supportive of vaccination say, hmm,

37:12.000 --> 37:17.760
 prevalence of virus where we live now is very low. So why risk having my kid get this vaccine-related

37:17.760 --> 37:22.160
 condition? Yeah, no, so this is an excellent question. Hopefully, we've hit on some of the

37:22.160 --> 37:29.040
 topics today. And I always frame this for parents that it's really a decision about vaccination

37:29.040 --> 37:34.000
 versus getting COVID, right? Things are a little quiet here. We expect to be a little quiet over

37:34.000 --> 37:40.160
 the summer. We are expecting to see increases in the fall of the winter. So as my wife says,

37:40.160 --> 37:44.080
 boy, with what we're doing, if you don't get vaccinated, it's just a question of when you or

37:44.080 --> 37:49.040
 your child get COVID. So that's how I try to weigh it. I say, well, if your child gets COVID,

37:49.040 --> 37:55.040
 I think we put the numbers out there. There's about a one in 46 chance that they're going to end up

37:55.040 --> 38:01.040
 with myocarditis from the infection itself based upon the athlete study. A lot of those cases will

38:01.040 --> 38:05.440
 be a symptom. Actually, you won't even know that. We know that some of those cases have been

38:05.440 --> 38:10.800
 severe enough that these athletes have been unable to perform, unable to participate in sports.

38:10.800 --> 38:16.640
 So we know about the long, well, already the longer-term effects of natural infection.

38:16.640 --> 38:22.480
 But what about vaccination? We've done millions of vaccinations in our country. There are a few

38:22.480 --> 38:29.200
 hundred cases of myocarditis under investigation. The vast majority of those have really lasted

38:29.200 --> 38:33.520
 for a day or two. They've gotten better with over-the-counter medications. They've resolved

38:33.520 --> 38:38.080
 the children have done well. I understand the argument, oh, my gosh, but who knows long-term?

38:38.080 --> 38:42.160
 Well, I think we know enough long-term. If you only had a very mild case that

38:42.160 --> 38:47.280
 resolved in 48 hours or less, there's really minimal expectation that that's going to do

38:47.280 --> 38:52.880
 serious harm to the heart. But boy, if you let your child go ahead and get infected with COVID,

38:52.880 --> 38:57.200
 myocarditis is just one of the risks that you would be concerned about.

38:57.200 --> 39:03.600
 That's COVID-19 clinical update number 67 with Dr. Daniel Griffin. Thank you, Daniel.

39:03.600 --> 39:08.960
 Oh, thank you so much. And everyone, be safe.
