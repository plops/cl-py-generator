 This week in virology, the podcast about viruses, the kind that make you sick.

00:10.240 --> 00:20.320
 From Microbe TV, this is Twiv, this week in virology, episode 790 recorded on August 5th, 2021.

00:20.320 --> 00:26.480
 I'm Vincent Rackeniello, and you're listening to the podcast all about viruses. Joining me today

00:26.480 --> 00:34.080
 from New York, Daniel Griffin. Hello, everyone. You got another good number, 790, Daniel.

00:35.040 --> 00:39.120
 It's a good number. You feel lucky you're going to get 800, you think?

00:40.160 --> 00:46.480
 You know that? I was actually noticing that that we are driving towards episode 800. It's sort of

00:46.480 --> 00:52.960
 amazing how much content has been produced. Yes, thanks to COVID for sure, otherwise we'd be

00:52.960 --> 01:00.960
 far behind. But speaking of COVID, what are you seeing in your hospital? Do you have a high burden

01:00.960 --> 01:08.240
 of cases? So I would say, no, no, we are seeing some. I mean, we're seeing in all honesty what

01:08.240 --> 01:14.400
 we expected when the vaccines came out. And when we started seeing real world efficacy on them,

01:14.960 --> 01:20.160
 we are certainly seeing an increasing number of people that test positive in the communities

01:20.160 --> 01:27.840
 that show up at our urgent cares. But the number of individuals in the hospital is actually relatively

01:27.840 --> 01:35.200
 low. Just to give perspective, say the Northwell system, 22 bed, 22 hospitals, large healthcare

01:35.200 --> 01:41.280
 system in New York, back during the early peak over 4,000 patients in the hospital at any given

01:41.280 --> 01:47.120
 time. We're maybe 150 in all the hospitals, right? So that puts it sort of low numbers.

01:47.120 --> 01:54.880
 We're certainly seeing them. We're not flooding the ICUs. We're not flooding the floors. But really

01:54.880 --> 02:02.080
 what I think that reflects as we look around the country is a high vaccine uptake in our local

02:02.080 --> 02:08.480
 area, right? So all right. So first, I'm going to start with a correction. I really enjoyed the

02:08.480 --> 02:14.560
 quotation when I heard Rich Condits say it. But it turns out last week's quotation was actually

02:14.560 --> 02:20.240
 not set by Richard Feynman. I actually went back and listened to the interview itself.

02:21.600 --> 02:28.560
 And what did he actually say? If you listen, he said, you see, one thing is I can live with

02:28.560 --> 02:34.240
 doubt and uncertainty and not knowing. I think it's much more interesting to live not knowing

02:34.240 --> 02:39.840
 than to have answers, which might be wrong. So I'm always trying to be a stickler for the truth.

02:39.840 --> 02:46.000
 So I appreciate that being pointed out. Let me start with my quotation this week, which I do

02:46.000 --> 02:52.240
 believe was actually said by this individual. Being defeated is often a temporary condition.

02:52.800 --> 02:58.720
 Giving up is what makes it permanent. And that's by Marilyn Voss-Savant.

03:00.000 --> 03:05.840
 And I think that we are having a tough time across the country, around the world.

03:05.840 --> 03:11.840
 But this is our fight to lose. We can still get ahead of this. We can still make a difference.

03:11.840 --> 03:15.840
 And we have learned a tremendous amount. And we have incredible tools. So

03:17.040 --> 03:22.720
 where are we at the moment? If you follow the dashboards, some of us still check the dashboards

03:22.720 --> 03:27.600
 on a regular basis. I like world-o-meter. I like their curves and their daily counts.

03:28.400 --> 03:35.680
 If you look at August 4th, I think I predicted in last month that we would be over 100,000

03:35.680 --> 03:45.200
 new cases per day. On August 4th, we had 112,279 new cases and 656 deaths just that one day.

03:47.040 --> 03:51.440
 I'm trying to figure out, you know, people have just become numb or there's some kind of emotional

03:51.440 --> 03:56.640
 fatigue. I think a lot of it is this emotional fatigue. People really just want this to be over.

03:57.520 --> 04:01.680
 As my grandmother used to say, if wishes were horses, beggars would ride.

04:01.680 --> 04:10.000
 And wish away, you have to actually act to make this change. The case fatality rate,

04:10.000 --> 04:14.640
 if you look at the millions of people in the United States that have had confirmed COVID-19,

04:15.360 --> 04:21.600
 it's right at 2%. So one in 50 people with confirmed case of COVID here in the US have

04:21.600 --> 04:26.800
 died during the acute period. But as we started our discussion events, and this is quite different

04:26.800 --> 04:34.160
 than the about one in a million risk if a person is vaccinated. So what I like to say is if everyone

04:34.160 --> 04:41.600
 in the country was vaccinated, we'd maybe see three to 400 deaths a year instead of 600 deaths

04:41.600 --> 04:49.280
 a day with our vaccine uptake challenges. Do you think that we will ever get to a point where most

04:49.280 --> 04:55.280
 people are vaccinated in the US? You know, we're already there, right? If you use the word most,

04:55.280 --> 05:03.040
 right? So over 70% of individuals eligible have started the vaccine process. Over 50% of eligible

05:03.040 --> 05:08.960
 individuals are fully vaccinated. You know, there's all this talk about all vaccine hesitancy. But

05:08.960 --> 05:12.960
 I mean, if you start doing the numbers, you realize, you know, it's the tyranny of the minority. I

05:12.960 --> 05:17.280
 mean, the majority of the eligible people are doing their part getting vaccinated,

05:18.080 --> 05:23.920
 helping us get to a point where we can move forward. So I'm actually quite optimistic and,

05:23.920 --> 05:28.000
 you know, some people and I, you know, have a lot of conversations. They're waiting for full

05:28.000 --> 05:32.720
 licensure. They keep saying it's not, it's not fully approved when it is, I will get vaccinated.

05:32.720 --> 05:38.480
 I believe some of them, not all of them. When all of the military personnel are vaccinated,

05:38.480 --> 05:43.600
 you know, after a while, right, people look at this, I was doing a medscape interview the other

05:43.600 --> 05:47.440
 day, that's sort of an educational thing. And I compared this to polio, people like, Oh, you know,

05:47.440 --> 05:52.640
 back when polio, everyone was just rushing to get vaccines. That's not actually true. So

05:52.640 --> 05:59.440
 it took five years to get to over 90% with the polio vaccines once they were fully licensed,

05:59.440 --> 06:05.040
 right? You know, we are at 70% starting the process at seven months. That's pretty good.

06:06.000 --> 06:11.360
 You know, we keep this up three more months. We'll be at 100%. Well, maybe not, but I'm optimistic.

06:11.360 --> 06:15.040
 Okay, good. What about you, Vincent? Are you optimistic?

06:15.840 --> 06:20.560
 No, I think, you know, we were, we were stuck at about half a million doses a day way down from

06:20.560 --> 06:26.720
 over a million, right? And only now because there have been huge upticks in the south,

06:27.520 --> 06:33.840
 in the Midwest, then now it's gone back up to 750,000 a day. So if that continues, that's good,

06:33.840 --> 06:38.720
 right? But it's going to take a while for us. So I'm not optimistic, because I think too many

06:38.720 --> 06:45.840
 people have issues with the vaccine. But I hear that perhaps by Labor Day, we'll have full

06:45.840 --> 06:51.280
 licensure for Pfizer. Is that true? Is that what you're here? That is the circulating rumor. I

06:51.280 --> 06:56.160
 suspect September to be a good month. I suspect that in September, we will have full licensure of

06:56.160 --> 07:02.640
 Pfizer. We'll have expansion down to six and up. And I really think that's going to be helpful,

07:02.640 --> 07:07.360
 because I think a lot of individuals would like access, but they would like access to a licensed

07:07.360 --> 07:14.400
 vaccine. So hopefully FDA will acknowledge this. All right, well, I like to start off with a couple

07:14.400 --> 07:22.240
 stories, just actually two individuals I saw today, who did maybe not get optimal care. And I want

07:22.240 --> 07:28.800
 to point out that I'm actually seeing the majority of patients in our area really get good care.

07:28.800 --> 07:33.040
 So these are kind of the outliers that hopefully are examples for everyone.

07:34.160 --> 07:39.440
 Learning lessons, we'll say. So one was a woman in her 20s. The other was a man in his 30s,

07:39.440 --> 07:48.000
 both unvaccinated. And the woman in her 20s will start with her. She she wasn't feeling well for

07:48.000 --> 07:55.440
 about three days, you know, typical viral syndrome. What was going through the back of her head,

07:55.440 --> 08:03.440
 we can imagine she went to an urgent care where the provider suggested that she get a COVID test.

08:03.440 --> 08:10.080
 She started to cry. She explains to me that she gets very emotional when she's sick. And so the

08:10.080 --> 08:16.720
 provider did not want her to cry. So said, Oh, don't worry, you don't need a COVID test. Go home,

08:16.720 --> 08:21.920
 take some of my broken Tylenol. Well, by the next day, she was starting to feel like maybe that was

08:21.920 --> 08:30.480
 not the best shared decision and went to a different urgent care the next day. This time, she shared

08:30.480 --> 08:34.960
 with me that the provider spent a little more time connected with her, encouraged her to get

08:34.960 --> 08:42.320
 tested. And yes, the test was positive. She had COVID. Now the provider said to her, listen,

08:42.320 --> 08:47.120
 you're in the first week sounds to me pretty good so far. We can treat this symptomatically.

08:47.120 --> 08:52.160
 We're going to follow and see how you do. If you start to have issues during the second week,

08:52.160 --> 08:58.400
 then we might suggest some other things. Little miss on this is this young lady had a BMI of

08:58.400 --> 09:04.080
 greater than 30, right? So it would have been nice for her to get the monoclonals. But instead,

09:04.080 --> 09:10.320
 I met this young lady today in the emergency room, hypoxic. And so she's been admitted to the

09:10.320 --> 09:17.440
 hospital. Second individual of man in his 30s. This we got a little more learning lessons here.

09:18.880 --> 09:26.960
 This individual went also to I remember this because he said what I said was really entertaining.

09:26.960 --> 09:31.040
 He said, you know, I went to a city MD and I thought there'd be MDs there, but there weren't.

09:31.760 --> 09:39.680
 And so he was seen by a non MD, whatever provider level, I'm not sure. But again, he was feeling

09:39.680 --> 09:44.960
 ill. He had decided not to get vaccinated. A decision he was regretting as we spoke.

09:46.560 --> 09:53.280
 And when he was seen, he was about three or four days into his illness. So he was for his viral

09:53.280 --> 10:02.800
 illness has confirmed COVID. He was given steroids and antibiotics. Now, fortunately, as he told me,

10:02.800 --> 10:07.840
 he decided after taking a few of the steroids that he wasn't happy continuing and did not

10:07.840 --> 10:13.920
 continue with the steroids. He did take the antibiotics, which as we know from a lot of evidence is not

10:13.920 --> 10:19.840
 really ideal. But now he's coming in during the second week. And actually, unfortunately,

10:19.840 --> 10:25.040
 in this gentleman, he's actually escalated despite starting steroids to our higher

10:25.040 --> 10:28.960
 amount of oxygen. We had to add to Salismab to his management. He's in the hospital.

10:30.000 --> 10:34.560
 He's passed really that acute window where we consider him decivir. So he's getting

10:34.560 --> 10:40.320
 oxygen steroids, to Salismab, anticoagulation. And we're going to follow. And hopefully,

10:40.320 --> 10:46.240
 this gentleman doesn't progress to mechanical ventilation or death. So again, two sort of

10:46.240 --> 10:51.280
 misses on the monoclonals. And I'm going to keep hammering on the monoclonals because really,

10:51.280 --> 10:56.880
 if you look at the studies, 70 to 80% reduction in people progressing. If they get them in that first

10:56.880 --> 11:03.200
 week, a BMI higher than 25 is really quite widespread in our population. Both these

11:03.200 --> 11:08.240
 individuals have BMI is greater than 30. And if you look at the studies, no deaths in the arms

11:08.240 --> 11:13.280
 that got monoclonals. So even if there is some degree of progression, people tend to do much

11:13.280 --> 11:18.880
 better if you can get things in during that window. All right, children and COVID.

11:19.600 --> 11:25.760
 As I like to say, children may be at low risk, but they are not at no risk. The media, I think,

11:25.760 --> 11:31.840
 has done a good job lately of pointing out that we are seeing rising rates of infections and

11:31.840 --> 11:39.280
 hospitalizations in children. And our listeners are likely aware that more children that get infected

11:39.280 --> 11:44.240
 percentage of these children will end up hospitalized. A percentage of these will go on to develop

11:44.240 --> 11:51.280
 long COVID. The number of cases in children actually doubled last this week compared to the prior

11:51.280 --> 11:58.320
 week to over 70,000 infections in children. And some really heartbreaking stories,

11:58.960 --> 12:03.920
 description of two children that died over the weekend at the Children's Hospital in Memphis,

12:03.920 --> 12:09.920
 Tennessee. One child was so ill that by the time the decision was made to send them to the hospital,

12:09.920 --> 12:16.640
 he actually died en route to the hospital. So just a reminder, children can die from COVID,

12:16.640 --> 12:22.720
 children can end up in the hospital, children can get long COVID. So as we plan for full in-person

12:22.720 --> 12:29.360
 schools, we really need to move past the myths about children based our decisions on the science

12:29.360 --> 12:35.040
 work with the facts. Children may be at lower risk for many of these complications. But they

12:35.040 --> 12:41.440
 are at risk. You know, as Nelson Mandela said, I believe he actually said this, there could be no

12:41.440 --> 12:47.040
 keener revelation of a society sold in the way in which it treats its children. So as we open the

12:47.040 --> 12:53.520
 schools, let's think about the safety, let's think about what we can do to make it safe to get

12:53.520 --> 12:59.440
 education. One of the things that I recently heard, which I agree with, is that wearing a mask is much

12:59.440 --> 13:05.280
 less traumatic for a child than being hospitalized, infecting their loved ones, seeing the loved ones

13:05.280 --> 13:10.080
 get sick or die or developing an illness in them that can last for months or even a lifetime.

13:11.360 --> 13:16.720
 All right, this is going to be sort of the meat of something. I'll say here, the pre-exposure

13:16.720 --> 13:24.800
 period transmission testing never miss an opportunity to test. This is actually a publication that was

13:24.800 --> 13:31.360
 discussed on the last 12, a deep dive into this. And I think I'm going to recommend everyone,

13:31.360 --> 13:37.040
 well, finish listening to me first, but then go back and listen to the last 12. But the publication

13:37.600 --> 13:45.200
 outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infections, including COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough infections associated with

13:45.200 --> 13:51.360
 large public gatherings, Barnstable County, Massachusetts, July 2021. This came out as an

13:51.360 --> 13:58.160
 early release in the MMWR. I would like if they would stop using the B word. I think spending a

13:58.160 --> 14:04.640
 little time reviewing this in detail is important, because I think that interpretations of this have

14:04.640 --> 14:11.040
 misinterpretations, I will say, have frightened a number of individuals and impacted this perception

14:11.040 --> 14:18.560
 about the role of vaccinated persons in this pandemic. Now, this was a solid group of authors

14:18.560 --> 14:24.320
 affiliated with the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, the CDC COVID-19 response team,

14:24.320 --> 14:29.680
 the Broad Institute, Cambridge, Massachusetts, Barnstable County Department of Health,

14:30.400 --> 14:34.400
 and the Environment, Massachusetts, and the Community Tracing Collaborative Commonwealth

14:34.400 --> 14:43.440
 of Massachusetts. So what was this MMWR report discussing? Well, the author's reported on 469

14:43.440 --> 14:47.760
 cases, right? So this is not a, it's not really a research study. It's a report. It was a report

14:47.760 --> 14:55.040
 on 469 cases of COVID-19 associated with multiple summer events and large public gatherings

14:55.680 --> 15:01.920
 in a town in Barnstable County, Massachusetts during July 2021.

15:01.920 --> 15:10.320
 Now, they did some sequencing on the specimens from 133 of the patients, and they identified the

15:10.320 --> 15:17.760
 Delta variant as responsible for 90% of the cases. The big issue here is a number of the

15:17.760 --> 15:24.960
 individuals were fully vaccinated either with the 2-dose mRNA vaccine or the J&J vaccine,

15:24.960 --> 15:32.800
 vaccine, and had that 14-day period. I'm not going to talk about what percent of the vaccinated

15:32.800 --> 15:38.080
 persons ended up infected. I think that there's sort of a nice deep dive is the more and more

15:38.080 --> 15:42.400
 people who are vaccinated, the more percent of the people who end up with an infection will be

15:42.400 --> 15:49.440
 vaccinated. I think that's sort of a math thing. But I will point out that one of the interpretations

15:49.440 --> 15:57.680
 of this report is that only 1% of the vaccinated individuals required hospitalizations,

15:57.680 --> 16:02.800
 and there were no deaths among the vaccinated people, right? So you could sort of do the math

16:02.800 --> 16:09.200
 on this, right? Unvaccinated, we see about a 20%, and we would expect to see, you know,

16:09.200 --> 16:13.280
 at least one or two deaths, maybe more about that 2% case fatality rate.

16:13.280 --> 16:20.240
 Now, the unvaccinated did not fare as well, and as pointed out, one of the unvaccinated

16:20.240 --> 16:28.640
 individuals, they're 123, so 1%, one of them did die. So, unfortunately, we're seeing that

16:28.640 --> 16:35.200
 unvaccinated people still are at significant risk. Now, what were sort of the details of this?

16:35.200 --> 16:41.680
 Because I think there is some important information here. Persons, the persons that had COVID-19

16:41.680 --> 16:48.640
 in this report, they reported that they had attended densely packed indoor and outdoor events

16:48.640 --> 16:54.720
 at venues that included bars, restaurants, guesthouses, and rental homes. I'm going to

16:54.720 --> 17:00.320
 say so far, so good, not so far, so good. I think we've been told, right? Those are high

17:00.320 --> 17:06.160
 risk venues. So these are vaccinated individuals with a decreased risk of infection, decreased

17:06.160 --> 17:12.240
 risk of death and hospitalization, but they are putting themselves in harm's way. For the people

17:12.240 --> 17:16.720
 that got vaccinated, it had been about three months since they completed their vaccinations,

17:16.720 --> 17:21.920
 a median of 86 days. So as we've discussed repeatedly, we are expected to see a drop

17:22.800 --> 17:27.760
 in the level of the antibodies, a drop in the protection against infection and localized

17:27.760 --> 17:33.760
 mucosal replication with transmission, but continued protection against moderate and severe

17:33.760 --> 17:40.080
 disease, which was demonstrated here. So this is what we saw. No deaths, only a 1% hospitalization

17:40.080 --> 17:47.120
 rate, instead of that 2% deaths and 20% hospitalization rate that we've consistently seen

17:47.120 --> 17:54.720
 in the unvaccinated. But then things get a little bit messy here. They report that they had cycle

17:54.720 --> 18:01.280
 threshold values, so CT values. Now, we have pretty sophisticated listeners here, and they

18:01.280 --> 18:06.560
 actually say when we, when we in this report, when we looked at those CT values, that they didn't

18:06.560 --> 18:13.280
 go to the subtlety, but I think we can hear the RNA copy numbers at the initial testing that they

18:13.280 --> 18:20.320
 had were similar between the vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. Now, our listeners are

18:20.320 --> 18:24.480
 very familiar, I think with this topic, and we've repeatedly returned to this over the last,

18:24.480 --> 18:30.240
 I'm going to say now 19 months. The CT value, the cycle threshold, is the number of cycles we

18:30.240 --> 18:37.280
 have to run that PCR machine prior to detecting the RNA in the sample, the less RNA, the more

18:37.280 --> 18:44.080
 amplification to get to a level of detection. So the more RNA the sooner the signal is detected.

18:44.080 --> 18:51.760
 Now, we did have information, a correlation between the RNA copy number for the ancestral and

18:51.760 --> 19:00.720
 alpha variants of COVID and contact tracing, as well as some virus culture data, are plaque-forming

19:00.720 --> 19:06.880
 units, PFUs, that's what PFU stands for for the toy listeners. But we still don't have this

19:06.880 --> 19:12.400
 information for the delta variant, and we still don't have this information for the person. So I

19:12.400 --> 19:18.960
 want to, I saw a wonderful sort of a tweet meme where it was the bark from the Simpsons writing

19:18.960 --> 19:27.280
 on the board over and over again, by RNA copy number is not viral load. CT value is not viral load.

19:27.280 --> 19:33.360
 So I don't want anyone to make that, quote unquote, rookie mistake. Those CT values do not

19:33.360 --> 19:38.320
 necessarily tell us that vaccinated persons are carrying, quote unquote, tremendous amounts of

19:38.320 --> 19:45.760
 virus in their noses. They have a high RNA copy number. We're going to get to some data in a moment

19:45.760 --> 19:53.840
 to show that that is actually short-lived relative to an individual who is unvaccinated. And as we've

19:53.840 --> 20:01.280
 discussed with a previous study, we're not sure that this is actual virus, or just a bunch of RNA,

20:01.280 --> 20:07.680
 and that the virus has been neutralized by the immune response. So I think that this, we need

20:07.680 --> 20:13.680
 that science before we jump to scary conclusions. So what are my takeaways from this study? I'm

20:13.680 --> 20:19.440
 going to come away with four. One, persons attending densely packed indoor and outdoor events and

20:19.440 --> 20:24.400
 venues that include bars, restaurants, guesthouses, and rental homes are at risk of infection with

20:24.400 --> 20:32.080
 SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, even if vaccinated. So just in case people didn't get

20:32.080 --> 20:39.680
 this vaccinated, people can get infected with SARS-CoV-2. Vaccinated persons can transmit.

20:39.680 --> 20:44.720
 This study didn't look at that. They did not look at secondary attack rates from vaccinated

20:44.720 --> 20:51.200
 individuals. So this study did not tell us about any transmission being done by vaccinated

20:51.200 --> 20:58.640
 individuals. So I think that's key. Two, in real-world situation, even months after completing

20:58.640 --> 21:04.720
 vaccination, our current COVID-19 vaccines continued to offer protection against moderate and severe

21:04.720 --> 21:11.200
 disease. In this study, only 1% of these individuals involved in these high-risk behaviors with really

21:11.200 --> 21:19.360
 significant exposure went on to require hospitalization and no deaths. Three, we see again that vaccinated

21:19.360 --> 21:24.880
 persons can get infected. And we know from other studies that vaccinated persons can transmit to

21:24.880 --> 21:31.280
 others. But as I mentioned, this study does not look at secondary attack rates or transmission.

21:31.280 --> 21:36.800
 And I don't think you want to walk away from this with that sort of conclusion or suggestion.

21:37.440 --> 21:44.560
 Four, we need to repeat our case contact studies, our tracing studies, our viral culture studies

21:44.560 --> 21:50.720
 with each new variant, and both vaccinated and unvaccinated persons to understand the kinetics

21:50.720 --> 21:56.800
 and their correlation with shedding of infectious replication-competent virus.

21:57.520 --> 22:00.480
 And I'm actually going to talk a little bit about a study that's starting to move in that

22:00.480 --> 22:08.160
 direction. All right, so I'm going to move forward to our next study. This one I really like

22:09.360 --> 22:15.760
 that suggests that maybe I didn't like the other one so much. This was a free print. And when I

22:15.760 --> 22:23.120
 was listening to TWIV 779, I guess it was, and Brianne was talking about the biological and

22:23.120 --> 22:28.800
 serological kinetics and talking about the red and the green curve. I was yelling at my radio,

22:28.800 --> 22:33.920
 Brianne, it's the Singapore study, it's a Singapore study. And this is the Singapore study, which is

22:33.920 --> 22:41.200
 great. Virological and serological kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant, vaccine breakthrough

22:41.200 --> 22:45.840
 infections, a multi-center cohort study. This was posted as a preprint, right? So it's still

22:45.840 --> 22:51.120
 going to go through peer review. We'll still get some more input. But I really like this because

22:51.120 --> 22:56.720
 we're starting to get the important information about the kinetics of the RNA copy number in both

22:56.720 --> 23:02.880
 vaccinated and unvaccinated persons infected with the Delta variant. Now we've heard before,

23:03.520 --> 23:09.040
 and this will challenge us that individuals with the Delta variant have a thousand times more

23:09.040 --> 23:15.440
 virus in their upper airways. This study here where we're seeing kinetics does not support that

23:15.440 --> 23:22.320
 contention. The authors conducted a multi-center retrospective cohort study of patients in Singapore

23:22.320 --> 23:28.320
 and compared the clinical features, biological and serological kinetics. So anti-capsid,

23:28.320 --> 23:34.640
 anti-spikes, surrogate virus neutralization titers between fully vaccinated and unvaccinated

23:34.640 --> 23:41.120
 individuals. A couple of things I will say. One is the odds of severe COVID-19 requiring

23:41.120 --> 23:47.840
 oxygen supplementation was significantly lower following vaccination, about a 93% reduction

23:47.840 --> 23:56.400
 with a p-value of 0.001, no deaths in the vaccinated group. Now the PCR cycle threshold, right,

23:56.400 --> 24:03.040
 CT values, the RNA copy number, was initially similar between vaccinated and unvaccinated

24:03.040 --> 24:10.560
 groups at diagnosis, but decreased much faster in vaccinated individuals. So if you look at the

24:10.560 --> 24:16.960
 levels we're seeing here, we're seeing CT values at about 20 early on, at about day one or two

24:16.960 --> 24:23.520
 of illness. That is a very similar number to what we saw with the other variants. So we're not seeing

24:23.520 --> 24:29.200
 support for this contention that it's a thousand times higher. But then what I think is great,

24:29.200 --> 24:33.760
 and I am going to say people go out there. This is not behind a paywall. Hopefully we'll post

24:33.760 --> 24:39.840
 this up on parasites without borders or COVID weekly updates. But if you look at this idea,

24:39.840 --> 24:47.440
 one, we do not know if this is replication competent infectious virus. We're looking at RNA,

24:47.440 --> 24:54.240
 but that RNA level starts to really fall off the cliff at about day five or six where the

24:54.240 --> 24:59.120
 unvaccinated really it's like a slide where you're not going to get much speed. It just really

24:59.120 --> 25:04.880
 continues to very slowly go down where we're seeing the individuals who are vaccinated really clear

25:04.880 --> 25:11.120
 this RNA. So this would be for me the idea that, okay, that first number may be high,

25:11.680 --> 25:16.960
 but vaccinated individuals, even if you're just looking at RNA levels, are quickly reducing that

25:16.960 --> 25:24.880
 a shorter period of time at these high RNA levels. Really evidence for me that being around vaccinated

25:24.880 --> 25:31.280
 people, even if they're exposed to an infected with SARS-CoV-2 is safer for me as an individual.

25:31.280 --> 25:38.880
 We still need more data. We still need the viral culture data to make sense of what these RNA

25:38.880 --> 25:44.400
 copy numbers mean. We need contact tracing to look more at the secondary attack rate.

25:45.120 --> 25:49.760
 And I want to say the information I've seen so far on Delta does not suggest to me a higher

25:49.760 --> 25:55.440
 secondary attack rate. We may have a shorter replication cycle. So, okay, four days later,

25:55.440 --> 25:59.680
 you've infected those two to three other people. Eight days later, you've injected,

25:59.680 --> 26:05.200
 you've infected another two to three people per two to three people. So it may appear from the

26:05.200 --> 26:10.320
 epidemiology to have a higher reproductive number, but I think that the secondary attack rate so far,

26:10.320 --> 26:15.360
 we're not seeing that this is quote, unquote, as contagious as chickenpox. We're just seeing a

26:15.360 --> 26:21.600
 faster spread. I have to say this is stuff we're working on. And my friend, Dr. Juan Potu,

26:22.400 --> 26:27.520
 up at the Everett Clinic in Washington, is collaborating with the University of Washington

26:27.520 --> 26:34.880
 with their BSL Virology Center. And we're actually going to hopefully get some really good information.

26:34.880 --> 26:41.360
 What do those CT values mean? What do they mean as far as platforming units, viral culture,

26:42.080 --> 26:46.080
 et cetera? Because I think this is really important for those public health recommendations. So,

26:46.640 --> 26:51.520
 I do not think the sky is falling. I still feel much safer around vaccinated individuals.

26:51.520 --> 27:00.640
 All right. Exciting news this week on passive immunization, monoclonal antibodies as post-exposure

27:00.640 --> 27:09.760
 prevention. So the Regeneron, COV, monoclonal antibody cocktail got expansion of their EUA

27:10.720 --> 27:20.400
 to include post-exposure prophylaxis for individuals who are either one, not fully vaccinated,

27:20.400 --> 27:27.040
 or two, are not expected to mount an adequate immune response to complete SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.

27:27.760 --> 27:33.600
 So, for example, a person who has an immunocompromising condition, who's on immunocompromising medications,

27:34.160 --> 27:40.800
 if they come in and say, I was exposed to an individual. I made a mistake. I had an exposure.

27:41.360 --> 27:47.040
 These individuals, if they're considered high-risk for progression, can go ahead and actually be

27:47.040 --> 27:53.120
 treated with the Regeneron, COV-2 cocktail. And they go on and give a little more information.

27:54.800 --> 27:59.760
 I do think that this is really critical. We've been talking a lot. We'll get back to this about

27:59.760 --> 28:04.480
 that third dose, boosters here in the United States when half the world hasn't had firsts.

28:05.280 --> 28:11.680
 We do not know in all honesty what that third dose offers as far as protection for our individuals

28:11.680 --> 28:17.360
 with immune compromising conditions. But we do have really good data about to present it on

28:17.360 --> 28:23.840
 what happens when you post-exposure prophylaxis individuals with the monoclonal. So, I want people

28:23.840 --> 28:30.000
 to think, this is a big changer in treatment, a big expansion. So, what is the science behind

28:30.000 --> 28:37.120
 this expansion? There was a paper. We've talked about this information previously, but now the

28:37.120 --> 28:44.400
 paper subcutaneous regen COV antibody combination to prevent COVID-19 was published in the New

28:44.400 --> 28:49.440
 England Journal of Medicine. And this study, individuals, I say individuals, because they're

28:49.440 --> 28:53.760
 not necessarily patients yet. They haven't been infected. They've just been exposed.

28:53.760 --> 29:00.080
 They were randomly assigned in a one-to-one ratio within 96 hours after a household contact

29:00.080 --> 29:06.960
 received a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. And they actually were treated with a subcutaneous

29:06.960 --> 29:12.960
 injection versus placebo. So, again, we don't need to necessarily have that IV. We could do this as

29:12.960 --> 29:21.280
 a subcutaneous. So, increase our access. The primary efficacy endpoint was the development of symptomatic

29:21.280 --> 29:31.840
 SARS-CoV-2 infection through day 28. And what did they find? Well, symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection

29:31.840 --> 29:40.400
 developed in 11 of the 753 participants in the treatment group, 1.5%, but in 7.8%

29:41.280 --> 29:53.040
 in the placebo group. So, this was a p-value of 0.01 by weeks 2 to 14, a total of 2 of the 753

29:53.040 --> 30:02.800
 participants in the Regeneron-CoV group, 0.3%, and 27 of the 752 participants in the placebo group,

30:02.800 --> 30:10.240
 3.6, had symptomatic SARS-CoV-2. So, we saw a relative risk reduction of 92.6.

30:11.200 --> 30:17.520
 Among the symptomatic infected participants, the median time to resolution of symptoms was

30:17.520 --> 30:23.520
 two weeks shorter than in the individuals that were treated. And the duration of, I'm going to

30:23.520 --> 30:30.480
 translate high viral load into high RNA levels, greater than 10 to the fourth copies per milliliter

30:30.480 --> 30:39.120
 was shorter, 0.4 versus 1.3, so about a week shorter there. So, that is now out in the New England

30:39.120 --> 30:44.240
 Journal of Medicine. So, a couple of times this last week, I've run into this and sort of been a

30:44.240 --> 30:49.200
 little bit shocked. The quote, unquote, in my experience from the physician saying,

30:49.200 --> 30:52.880
 I haven't really had great experience with those monoclonals, but in my experience,

30:52.880 --> 30:57.440
 the remdesivir has been working really well. Yes.

30:58.320 --> 31:03.360
 So, Daniel, how can they do the control group, isn't that withholding standard of care in the

31:03.360 --> 31:09.040
 control group if you know they're exposed? So, this was actually the study that gave the

31:09.040 --> 31:15.040
 indication. So, prior to this, exposed individuals, there was no treatment option. Now, we know that

31:15.040 --> 31:20.640
 if you're exposed at your high-risk individual, you can go ahead, get this antibody combination,

31:20.640 --> 31:25.760
 and for about three months, have this passive antibody protection. Now, can you do a placebo

31:25.760 --> 31:29.920
 control trial in the future? Actually, the monoclonals, it's a problem they can't.

31:29.920 --> 31:34.320
 It's actually considered that effective, which sort of throws a little bit of a wrench in the

31:34.320 --> 31:41.120
 system. Why are they not FDA approved if they're considered so potent, so valuable, so impactful?

31:41.120 --> 31:49.600
 So, yeah, if the FDA is listening. All right, active vaccination, never miss an opportunity to

31:49.600 --> 31:55.520
 vaccinate. Vaccination is how this pandemic ends. We keep getting more information comparing

31:55.520 --> 32:02.400
 natural infection, induced immunity compared to vaccine-induced protection, and another article,

32:02.400 --> 32:08.400
 neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 variants, induced by natural infection or vaccination,

32:08.400 --> 32:13.680
 a systematic review and pooled meta-analysis. So, this is pulling a lot of things together.

32:14.240 --> 32:21.600
 When we pull these 106 articles together, we basically were seeing that the beta, the gamma,

32:21.600 --> 32:28.560
 and delta significantly escaped natural infection-mediated neutralization. Neutralizing antibody

32:28.560 --> 32:36.400
 levels induced by mRNA vaccines were, in general, at least the same level or higher. So, just more

32:36.400 --> 32:41.840
 and more data suggesting that vaccination is really the way to go. Don't take a chance.

32:42.560 --> 32:48.880
 I have certainly seen plenty of reinfections. And it's really at about six months when we start

32:48.880 --> 32:53.680
 to see, at 180 days when we start to see the reinfections rise. But I've seen them as early as

32:53.680 --> 32:59.520
 three months. And once you've had SARS-CoV-2, once you've had COVID-19, you really don't want

32:59.520 --> 33:07.600
 a second infection. All right. So, as I said early on, the viral replication or viral symptom

33:07.600 --> 33:12.560
 phase, what I like to say, the time for monitoring and monoclonal and not the time for antibiotics,

33:12.560 --> 33:18.320
 well, monoclonal are not just for this phase anymore. It can now be moved up to prophylaxis as

33:18.320 --> 33:24.400
 well. But remember, they are out there and we need to keep using them. They shouldn't sit on shelves.

33:25.520 --> 33:31.360
 Okay. The early inflammatory phase, right? This is that time when everyone ends up in the hospital

33:31.360 --> 33:39.440
 and gets the remdesivir. Well, let's talk a little bit about that. To be clear, the data on remdesivir

33:39.440 --> 33:45.360
 has never been very persuasive. And the FDA approval was based on the idea that this drug,

33:45.360 --> 33:51.120
 remdesivir, could reduce hospital stays, not mortality, not morbidity, but that it would reduce

33:51.120 --> 33:56.800
 the amount of time people ended up in the hospital. Well, the article association of remdesivir

33:56.800 --> 34:02.400
 treatment with survival and length of hospital stay among US veterans hospitalized with COVID-19

34:03.440 --> 34:08.400
 really supports what I am seeing, what is being seen across the country, that remdesivir may

34:08.400 --> 34:14.800
 be associated with unnecessary and prolonged hospital stays. So what did we see here? This was

34:14.800 --> 34:22.720
 a cohort study of 2,344 US veterans hospitalized with COVID-19. The investigators reported that

34:22.720 --> 34:27.760
 remdesivir was not associated with improved 30-day survival, but was associated with a

34:27.760 --> 34:33.360
 significant increase in median time to hospital discharge. The findings suggested that routine

34:33.360 --> 34:39.440
 use of remdesivir may be associated with increased use of hospital beds, but not with any improvements.

34:39.440 --> 34:44.960
 So I think this is really relevant in many areas of the country where we hear about rising

34:44.960 --> 34:50.800
 hospitalizations and it's worth asking if all these people are really benefiting from these

34:50.800 --> 34:58.640
 five-day remdesivir stays at $3,000 per course of remdesivir, the huge costs associated with

34:58.640 --> 35:05.760
 hospitalizations, the filling of those hospital beds. So a lot of these individuals, really,

35:05.760 --> 35:12.320
 to be honest, the data would suggest could be treated quite well at home with oxygen

35:12.320 --> 35:17.200
 oral steroids, keeping these beds open for people who really need them, people who are going to

35:17.200 --> 35:21.920
 have an escalation of oxygen requirements, and actually all the other individuals who need the

35:21.920 --> 35:30.480
 services of our acute care facilities. All right, so the tail phase long COVID, we keep getting

35:30.480 --> 35:37.600
 confirmation of the significant risks of developing long COVID. This is a real thing. The article

35:37.600 --> 35:43.600
 post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection and impact on quality of life, one to six months after

35:43.600 --> 35:49.120
 illness and association with initial symptom severity was published in open form infectious

35:49.120 --> 35:57.200
 disease. The authors reported that among 290 patients discharged from an outpatient telemedicine

35:57.200 --> 36:02.400
 program night, so we're starting to get information on individuals who did not require hospitalization.

36:02.960 --> 36:11.040
 39.7%, almost 40% reported persistent symptoms, including fatigue, dyspneion exertion,

36:11.040 --> 36:16.000
 mental fog among others. So fatigue was 20%, dyspnea was 14%,

36:16.720 --> 36:23.600
 mental fog was 13.5%, and 40% of individuals who are treated in this outpatient program

36:23.600 --> 36:30.720
 had symptoms that continued. So long COVID is real. Unfortunately, I'm hearing reports that we may

36:30.720 --> 36:36.960
 have even underestimated the incidents in adolescents and younger children. That will be critical to

36:36.960 --> 36:42.080
 keep an eye on those numbers as we sort of see more children getting infected. All right,

36:42.080 --> 36:47.600
 what's going on in the rest of the world outside the high income in the low and middle income

36:47.600 --> 36:55.040
 countries? As I like to say, no one is safe until everyone is safe, just a little musing

36:55.040 --> 37:01.920
 on third doses versus first doses. As we're seeing, there's already a code here in the US,

37:01.920 --> 37:08.160
 they're kind of getting ready to allow us to give third doses. There's a little bit of a dialogue

37:08.160 --> 37:14.800
 and Jen Psaki was talking about sort of the US perception on this. I do not know the right

37:14.800 --> 37:19.680
 answer, so I'm just going to put this out there. Her presentation was that our ability to give

37:19.680 --> 37:25.600
 third doses here in the US will not necessarily impact our ability to provide first doses in many

37:25.600 --> 37:30.960
 other parts of the world. I think that's really important when we make these decisions to realize

37:30.960 --> 37:36.560
 that there is an equity aspect and there's a science aspect. And now that we have the potential

37:36.560 --> 37:42.160
 to use our monoclonals for those individuals who did not respond to just two doses, I think

37:42.160 --> 37:46.640
 it's important that we balance those in our decisions. So whether that's true or not,

37:46.640 --> 37:52.080
 I think it's important to know whether or not that's true. What's the science behind a third dose,

37:52.720 --> 37:59.360
 Daniel? Yeah, we don't have any. I should say the lack of science behind the third dose.

38:00.240 --> 38:04.400
 Yeah, it would be nice to have that science before we started giving people third doses, so yes.

38:04.400 --> 38:13.680
 Good. Good call, Vincent. So let me close by thanking all our supporters. And I want to say

38:13.680 --> 38:18.320
 thanks to an anonymous donor right there under the wire at the end of last month,

38:18.320 --> 38:23.280
 we were pushed right up to our goal. So we were able to provide full support for FIMRIC.

38:24.000 --> 38:28.720
 We cut them a check for $40,000 to help them with their efforts. They're starting to do

38:28.720 --> 38:38.640
 some overseas, some in-persons traveling, starting to return. And so I was going to wear my rotary

38:38.640 --> 38:45.280
 club international polio bow tie, which I will remember to do. But just the whole point is that

38:45.280 --> 38:49.680
 we can't do this without your support. So thank you for your continued support. And we are now

38:49.680 --> 38:55.440
 moving on starting this month. So August, September, October, all donations made to parasites without

38:55.440 --> 38:59.840
 borders will support floating doctors. So go to parasites without borders.com,

38:59.840 --> 39:05.600
 click the donate button, and help us support all the work that we do, as well as floating doctors.

39:06.800 --> 39:13.280
 Great. Congratulations, FIMRIC. It's wonderful. That is fantastic. Time for some questions for

39:13.280 --> 39:19.840
 Daniel. You can send yours to Daniel at micro.tv. Jason is going to have a catered party in a few

39:19.840 --> 39:25.200
 weeks out on Long Island. Hey, Daniel, maybe you can go. I was waiting for the invite. Is there

39:25.200 --> 39:31.280
 an invite in this email? Wait, let's see how well they do to keep people safe. 130 or so guests,

39:31.280 --> 39:37.600
 we have a handful of unvaccinated. I'm assuming we need masks for them and kids who aren't vaccinated.

39:37.600 --> 39:44.640
 Can they test out of a mask requirement? Would we do a rapid or PCR or both? And how long before the

39:44.640 --> 39:50.880
 party? Well, what we try to talk about, right? Like, let's say I was in charge. I was your

39:50.880 --> 39:56.320
 infection control officer. What would I recommend? The biggest thing I recommend, you've got over

39:56.320 --> 40:03.280
 100 people. This is a large gathering by any sort of criteria. You really want to keep everyone

40:03.280 --> 40:07.440
 outdoors, right? We've got the high holidays, the Jewish holidays coming up in September.

40:07.440 --> 40:12.000
 When I'm asked about that, I always say, let's keep people outdoors. One of the things we say

40:12.000 --> 40:17.680
 about outdoors is part of what's safe about outdoors is that dilution, but also your ability

40:17.680 --> 40:22.240
 to have a little bit of space. So let's kind of keep going with that, you know, state that three

40:22.240 --> 40:29.440
 or four feet apart outdoors, starting to keep things very safe. You can do testing, but remember,

40:29.440 --> 40:34.960
 no test is 100% and tests don't predict the future. So those are important things. If someone had

40:34.960 --> 40:39.440
 a test the day before, if they had a test that morning, the day before might be a more sensitive

40:39.440 --> 40:44.480
 test. But then again, the person, you know, the test doesn't predict the future. They might

40:44.480 --> 40:51.040
 have a point of care test. Again, not every test is 100% sensitive. So as we're learning or as we're

40:51.040 --> 40:55.200
 communicating, as we're trying to reinforce, even vaccinate, people can get infected and spread.

40:55.200 --> 40:59.600
 So those would be my big things. Keep it outdoors, try to keep people spaced apart.

41:00.560 --> 41:05.200
 Mass are great, right? And you got 100, you got over 100 people, someone showing up at your party

41:05.200 --> 41:10.560
 infected with COVID, just with SARS-CoV-2. So, you know, if you don't want any transmission,

41:10.560 --> 41:16.480
 if you've got vulnerable people there, really, you know, encouraging masks is great, staying outdoors

41:16.480 --> 41:20.080
 is great, right? People are going to have drinks. They're going to eat food. So then you sort of

41:20.080 --> 41:25.040
 step aside, I always think of that as a time when my mask is off, is off and I'm not going to be

41:25.040 --> 41:31.520
 face to face with an individual. So remember, layered approaches increase safety. Nothing is 100%

41:31.520 --> 41:37.280
 safe. So balance your risks and risk tolerance. Tom writes, I know guidance from FDA and CDC at

41:37.280 --> 41:42.240
 this point is that boosters are not needed to prevent disease. However, it seems like they could

41:42.240 --> 41:46.960
 prevent infection as a third dose appears to elevate neutralizing antibodies to 100x if you take the

41:46.960 --> 41:51.840
 Pfizer data at face value. While we don't know if neutralizing antibodies are a correlate of

41:51.840 --> 41:57.520
 protection from severe disease, it does seem to correlate with infection based on small data from

41:57.520 --> 42:03.440
 NEJM paper out of Israel. As a father of two young children, I'm finding it hard not to go and

42:03.440 --> 42:07.440
 find a third dose. I'm not worried about myself. Instead, a mild case that allows me to transmit

42:07.440 --> 42:13.600
 Myers to my children. I still may wear masks in areas where I can't verify vaccination status,

42:13.600 --> 42:19.120
 but I am worried this might not be enough. For instance, do we need to go back to the days of

42:19.120 --> 42:23.840
 masking around everyone, not in our immediate family, such as my parents and in-laws? To me,

42:23.840 --> 42:28.160
 I would see, I would like to see boosters who are in an expedition to the vaccines to those less

42:28.160 --> 42:32.560
 than 12, not looking for you to comment on whether I should get a third dose, but rather,

42:32.560 --> 42:37.200
 on how the FDA full approval might change the ability of physicians to prescribe a third dose,

42:37.200 --> 42:42.160
 would full approval allow doctors to write off-label prescriptions based on the needs and risks of

42:42.160 --> 42:46.640
 their patients? Well, I'm sort of glad, Vincent, that you and I hit on this a little bit. I've

42:46.640 --> 42:52.320
 been the first thing we really need is the science. One of the aspects of vaccines,

42:52.320 --> 42:57.680
 which is really not something we have a lot of great evidence for or a lot of vaccines that have

42:57.680 --> 43:03.840
 a trackcard for is preventing infection. Vaccines are really good at preventing illness,

43:04.400 --> 43:08.240
 really good at preventing serious illness. We look at the injectable polio vaccine. Does

43:08.240 --> 43:16.160
 the injectable polio vaccine prevent infection? Vincent, I'll ask you. No. Is it a crummy vaccine?

43:16.160 --> 43:23.280
 No, it's a great vaccine. What we do not know and what people would like to know is, as we've seen,

43:23.280 --> 43:28.080
 it does look like vaccinated people may be less likely to transmit to others. And that's one of

43:28.080 --> 43:32.400
 the things that actually when we talk about, oh, health care workers should get vaccinated. We're

43:32.400 --> 43:35.840
 not worried about protecting the health care workers from getting sick. We're thinking the

43:35.840 --> 43:42.000
 vaccines may somehow protect our patients. Before we start pushing third vaccines, we need the

43:42.000 --> 43:46.320
 science. The science is something we can get. The experiments we can do, the contact tracing we

43:46.320 --> 43:53.440
 can do. And we need to do the studies. If you give individuals a shot at six months, if you give

43:53.440 --> 43:58.240
 them a quote unquote booster, does that really accomplish what we're after? We still need the

43:58.240 --> 44:02.880
 science. And I think that when we look at the amount of money we spend on so many different things,

44:03.680 --> 44:07.360
 we need to spend the money on this. We need to do these studies. We need that information.

44:09.040 --> 44:13.360
 We need to know what do the vaccines do as far as protection against severe disease.

44:13.360 --> 44:18.880
 We also need what they can do relative to transmission and even just infection. Right now,

44:18.880 --> 44:25.680
 we're just sort of guessing. And as you point out, neutralizing antibodies are not a clear, reliable

44:25.680 --> 44:31.520
 correlate of protection. Keel is right. So I'm a primary care doctor here in steamy Jacksonville,

44:31.520 --> 44:37.360
 Florida. We're having a terrible time with SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 disease here.

44:37.360 --> 44:44.480
 What, if anything, is the role of UVC light to potentially sterilize the air? If UVC

44:44.480 --> 44:48.320
 room light can be helpful, especially in places where mask mandates are prohibited,

44:48.320 --> 44:54.800
 like our schools, EGAD, or ignored, could UVC light be another mitigating measure expensive,

44:54.800 --> 45:00.080
 probably impractical? And I do wonder about long-term exposure, but at least it's passive.

45:00.080 --> 45:08.640
 What do you know, Daniel? Yeah, it's this painful. I'm so sorry. If they find out that you are

45:08.640 --> 45:14.080
 opening the windows or spending time outdoors or using UVC or any other measure to decrease

45:14.080 --> 45:18.880
 your risk of getting infected, sick, or dying, you may end up in trouble in that state.

45:18.880 --> 45:30.240
 So it's a little crazy to me that, you know, anyway, I'm so back to the science. We actually

45:30.240 --> 45:34.160
 discussed on some of the twibs, and then we actually some pretty good deep dives in some of my

45:34.160 --> 45:40.080
 non-updates looking at UVC. And so this is definitely a modality that has been looked at and may play a

45:40.080 --> 45:46.160
 role. And I think there's also a safety aspect here. Usually not shining these in people, but

45:46.160 --> 45:51.280
 there's specific frequencies that you want to look at. So I won't go too into that. And actually,

45:51.280 --> 45:55.200
 maybe in our show notes, we can put the link to when there was a deep dive and some of the data

45:55.200 --> 46:03.280
 here. But, you know, as we like to say, you know, this is something where if you can do something

46:03.280 --> 46:09.040
 about the quality of the air that can actually decrease your risk. So we've talked about a lot

46:09.040 --> 46:13.120
 of these school studies, when they've done things with improved ventilation, with open windows,

46:13.120 --> 46:18.960
 all these different strategies are part of that multilayered mitigation approach. Just don't tell

46:18.960 --> 46:23.600
 what people why you're doing it. Isn't it crazy that they're preventing you to wear a mask? I mean,

46:23.600 --> 46:28.960
 what are they thinking? Yeah, next thing you know, they're going to outlaw seatbelts because

46:28.960 --> 46:35.600
 it compromises freedom. Don't be no airbags. I'm not sure what they said. Yeah. Good thing they

46:35.600 --> 46:45.200
 can't get near airplanes, right? All right, Jennifer has two questions. First, with Delta,

46:45.200 --> 46:52.400
 do we have to change our masking? Do we need N95, K95s or double masking with a surgical under

46:52.400 --> 46:57.680
 a cloth mask? What are your thoughts on this? Yeah, I mean, let's be really clear about what

46:57.680 --> 47:03.520
 the science is, right? The science is not that you walk past someone on the street. I mean,

47:03.520 --> 47:07.840
 I was on a call yesterday and actually one of the questions was, I heard that it only takes five

47:07.840 --> 47:15.520
 seconds of exposure to get infected with the Delta variant. No, it does not. If you look at the

47:15.520 --> 47:21.280
 secondary attack rate for the alpha and the delta, there's data out of the UK, it actually looks like

47:21.280 --> 47:26.000
 at one point, it was pretty similar. Actually, current data suggests it's a lower secondary

47:26.000 --> 47:32.720
 attack rate with Delta. And these studies are really hard because you have all the non-pharmaceutical

47:32.720 --> 47:38.320
 interventions, right? The masking, the heightened awareness. So we have no compelling data in all

47:38.320 --> 47:44.320
 honesty that the Delta is going to spread, going to get through masks, things that we worry about.

47:44.320 --> 47:49.680
 It does look like it spreads faster. It does look like there's a quicker replication cycle

47:49.680 --> 47:55.440
 from exposure to you being able to spread it to the next person. But I do not think there's any

47:55.440 --> 48:01.280
 biology or any evidence that says you need to change your approaches. I still encourage people

48:01.280 --> 48:07.440
 to think about masks, the surgical mask as source control when you're coughing, sneezing, breathing,

48:07.440 --> 48:14.640
 you're catching in. But as far as you protecting yourself, the KN95s do a better job. So when I walk

48:14.640 --> 48:22.560
 into a room with an individual who has COVID, I wear an N95 mask. When my family or I travel on a

48:22.560 --> 48:30.560
 plane, we all wear the KN95 masks. Physician today walked into one of the rooms with two surgical

48:30.560 --> 48:36.000
 masks thinking that that was really a great way to protect against COVID. It's not. So think about

48:36.000 --> 48:41.040
 using the right mask in the right situation. I mean, I think it's interesting that Delta is the

48:41.040 --> 48:46.560
 symbol for change, but Delta has not changed our non-pharmaceutical interventions still work.

48:46.560 --> 48:54.160
 And Jennifer wants to know if the 15 minutes, six feet recommendations have changed?

48:55.120 --> 48:59.200
 You know, in some places they've been using 10 minutes for a while just to be sort of,

48:59.200 --> 49:05.280
 but that's been for a while. That has not really changed recently. It is interesting. I'll tell

49:05.280 --> 49:12.240
 you in New York State, the exposure is 10 minutes within six feet and they don't care whether it's

49:12.240 --> 49:18.240
 indoor or outdoor, which doesn't really sit with the science. But that's the deal.

49:18.240 --> 49:25.920
 That's COVID-19 clinical update number 74 with Dr. Daniel Griffin. Thank you, Daniel.

49:25.920 --> 49:34.080
 Oh, thank you. And everyone, be safe.
