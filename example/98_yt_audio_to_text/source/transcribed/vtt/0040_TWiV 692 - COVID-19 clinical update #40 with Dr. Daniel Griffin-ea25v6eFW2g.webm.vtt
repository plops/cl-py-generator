 This week in virology, the podcast about viruses, the kind that make you sick.

00:10.400 --> 00:20.960
 From Microbe TV, this is Twiv. This week in virology, episode 692, recorded on December 10, 2020.

00:21.520 --> 00:27.920
 I'm Vincent Rackeniello, and you're listening to the podcast all about viruses. Joining me today

00:27.920 --> 00:35.520
 from New York, Daniel Griffin. Hello, everyone. How's it going, Daniel?

00:37.200 --> 00:42.320
 Today was a long day. I think it's getting pretty bad, and we'll talk about that. But

00:43.600 --> 00:53.200
 let me start with my quotation. Wise men say, only fools rush in, but I can't help falling

00:53.200 --> 00:59.120
 in love with you. Now, some of our listeners probably know who that is by. That's Elvis Presley.

00:59.920 --> 01:06.560
 What people may not know is that he is referring to the polio vaccine when he wrote that song.

01:09.040 --> 01:13.440
 Are we going to exhumed and revaccinate him with SARS-CoV-2 vaccines now?

01:15.680 --> 01:19.040
 We probably didn't want to do it on this show, but let's do it. I just want to let everyone

01:19.040 --> 01:24.640
 know Elvis is actually still alive, and he's returning for a COVID-19 vaccination next week.

01:25.680 --> 01:31.520
 Well, you can see it here, right? No, I'm joking on that. I wish Elvis was still with us. What a

01:31.520 --> 01:37.040
 tremendous, talented individual he was. But let's start a little bit. I'll get back to why that

01:37.040 --> 01:41.920
 quotation. Why are we not quoting Winston Churchill? Why Elvis Presley? But we will get there. But I

01:41.920 --> 01:46.320
 just sort of bring some people up to date, patient updates. Everyone keeps seeing these numbers,

01:46.320 --> 01:54.000
 but I like to put a face on the numbers. We actually, Vincent and I were together on a call

01:55.120 --> 02:00.560
 about a week ago, actually, this last week. And Shane Crotty was on, and he was talking about

02:00.560 --> 02:06.960
 issues with reinfection. There were a couple of physicians on, and Shane Crotty's data is

02:06.960 --> 02:12.560
 really great and all. But we're seeing reinfection. I think I've talked about that a few times.

02:12.560 --> 02:18.480
 My partner today called me and we discussed it a case. This was a gentleman who was admitted

02:18.480 --> 02:25.760
 originally back in March, had a pretty severe case of COVID. And now they're back in the hospital.

02:25.760 --> 02:32.800
 They're septic. We did a COVID PCR, and it was positive, right? So pretty hard for me to say that,

02:32.800 --> 02:38.160
 wow, what is this? 10 months later, that that's somehow persistent from the March of 2020.

02:38.160 --> 02:43.840
 So we're seeing cases and number of physicians were on the call saying, we're seeing these,

02:43.840 --> 02:48.880
 but we're busy. We're in the trenches. We don't have samples from March and April to do the genetics.

02:49.600 --> 02:53.920
 So this raise a concern. Don't think that just because you had it, you don't have to worry.

02:53.920 --> 02:58.000
 There's a certain percent of people that are getting reinfected. We don't know what percent

02:58.000 --> 03:04.720
 that is, but we'll see as we go forward. Had another gentleman, and this brought me back to

03:04.720 --> 03:09.040
 the Irish patient. I don't know if people remember. People who've been longtime listeners may remember

03:09.040 --> 03:18.000
 the Irish patient, a young man in his 30s. And I felt like it was back to March again, admitted

03:18.000 --> 03:25.040
 another gentleman in his 30s. No past medical history, really sick. Basically did the same things

03:25.040 --> 03:30.880
 that we learned from our Irish patient. The person was so ill that we had to intubate him. We had

03:30.880 --> 03:37.840
 to lay him prone. He's really on maximal vent settings. And we're hoping that he's going to make

03:37.840 --> 03:42.960
 it through this, but really, really sick. People have another sort of myth perception out there.

03:42.960 --> 03:49.600
 Oh, the virus isn't so bad this time. Yeah, it's bad. We're seeing the aftermath of Thanksgiving,

03:49.600 --> 03:54.720
 which for me is kind of tough because now we're admitting families, right? And we admitted a couple

03:54.720 --> 04:01.680
 sisters. One of them died Monday morning. Her sister's still alive, but on a ventilator.

04:02.400 --> 04:08.000
 And today I admitted a mother and she was quite upset because she said, you know what, Dr. Griffin,

04:08.000 --> 04:12.080
 don't worry so much about me. What I'm really worried about is my daughter who's right here

04:12.080 --> 04:18.960
 in the room with me. The daughter went to see her mother-in-law for Thanksgiving. The mother-in-law

04:18.960 --> 04:25.120
 actually fainted on Thanksgiving and then was diagnosed the next day with COVID. They were

04:25.120 --> 04:28.880
 trying to help the mother-in-law. Everyone was trying to do the right thing. People were wearing

04:28.880 --> 04:32.240
 masks. The mother-in-law was wearing a mask. They took the mask off the mother-in-law,

04:32.240 --> 04:37.440
 sort of helped her kind of feel better, got her to the hospital. But that whole event led to her

04:37.440 --> 04:41.760
 getting sick. The mother getting sick, basically the whole family is sick. So,

04:44.320 --> 04:48.880
 I guess I'll move right into the pre-exposure period with this. I try to keep giving people

04:48.880 --> 04:53.520
 the facts so they can make their own decision. You know, it's difficult when people make bad

04:53.520 --> 04:58.160
 decisions. And I see the consequences of that. We're here for you. We're going to take care of

04:58.160 --> 05:01.600
 you. I'm here to educate you to give you the information you need to make the best decisions.

05:02.320 --> 05:06.000
 But just keep these facts in mind when you're thinking about what you're going to do tonight

05:06.000 --> 05:13.200
 is Hanukkah. Coming up soon is going to be Christmas, Kwanzaa, New Year. So, people are making plans

05:13.200 --> 05:20.080
 now. We had over 3,000 people die in the US just yesterday. Things are really bad out there.

05:20.080 --> 05:24.240
 And we're going to get to the fact that the vaccine is really right here on the horizon.

05:24.240 --> 05:28.960
 So, let's try to make some good decisions. Also in the pre-exposure period, let's go

05:28.960 --> 05:35.280
 back to the schools, right? There was a nice article in the CDC MMWR. This was implementing

05:35.280 --> 05:42.000
 mitigation strategies in early care and education settings for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

05:42.000 --> 05:47.280
 And you looked at eight states in the period of September through October. And that's the

05:47.280 --> 05:50.880
 time to look, right? I mean, I've seen studies where they talk about infections between like

05:50.880 --> 05:56.160
 April and September. And schools were closed. I don't really know what, you know, what you make

05:56.160 --> 06:00.880
 up stuff with that. But this was a really good article. And, you know, the CDC has been beaten

06:00.880 --> 06:04.480
 up a lot, but there's really some great people. And they're really putting some great information

06:04.480 --> 06:12.320
 out there for us. And this article described the role of mitigation for Head Start programs. And

06:12.320 --> 06:17.440
 people in the US probably know the Head Start, but the rest of the world. This is a really tremendous

06:17.440 --> 06:24.240
 program. There's Head Start and Early Head Start. And these are programs for kids five and under.

06:24.240 --> 06:29.200
 And it promotes early learning, healthy development among children. And what did they do here? So,

06:29.200 --> 06:35.280
 they provided quite a bit of guidance, information on masks, personal protective equipment,

06:35.280 --> 06:40.720
 the physical setup. So, you could do this in a safer situation. Supplies for actually maintaining

06:40.720 --> 06:46.560
 those healthy environments and operations. They even sort of, actually, there was financial aid

06:47.120 --> 06:52.800
 in all this, helping them get additional staff members so that they could have smaller class sizes.

06:52.800 --> 06:58.720
 And when they implemented all these programs, they actually saw very few cases of transmission

06:58.720 --> 07:04.480
 among the children and the staff members. So, just sort of helpful to see, you know,

07:04.480 --> 07:10.480
 we went into this, we didn't know, and we're learning, can we do things that make it safer

07:10.480 --> 07:17.360
 to be in these environments? And I think just more information that we can. I always know that this

07:17.360 --> 07:23.120
 triggers sort of a wedge issue, sending kids to school or not. And so, I always try to make

07:23.120 --> 07:27.760
 the qualification that this tells us that you can do it safely. It doesn't say you are doing it

07:27.760 --> 07:33.360
 safely. So, if you're looking at having kids in in-person learning environments, you can't just do

07:33.360 --> 07:38.160
 it. You can't just make believe it's, you know, 2018 and stick 30 kids, you know, a couple of

07:38.160 --> 07:43.520
 feet away from each other. This was a study showing that you can make it safer with proper

07:43.520 --> 07:48.400
 mitigation, with spacing. And now, we're seeing in a lot of areas, they're really introducing

07:48.960 --> 07:54.240
 testing, actually, becoming a big issue here in the New York area because, as people probably are

07:54.240 --> 08:00.320
 where our rates are really climbing, you know, and I look on the map and I see that where I live,

08:00.320 --> 08:05.120
 I now live in a red area. That doesn't mean we're socialists or communists. It means we've got way

08:05.120 --> 08:11.280
 too much COVID. So, we need to, if we're going to ask those kids to go to school, if we're going to

08:11.280 --> 08:15.600
 ask those teachers to be there and teach our kids, we got to give them the necessary resources,

08:15.600 --> 08:23.200
 the necessary guidance. Can't just, can't just send in those folks. All right, vaccines. You know,

08:23.200 --> 08:27.360
 Vincent pulled me away. It was like, you know, the Super Bowl, I had gone into extra time,

08:27.360 --> 08:33.600
 and then Vincent's like, it's time to record Twiv. So, we'll get what was going on right before I

08:33.600 --> 08:40.400
 jumped in is the FDA was having their EUA meeting and discussing what to do with the Pfizer vaccine.

08:41.120 --> 08:44.800
 I know a lot of people are thinking actually about the time this drops will know, you know,

08:44.800 --> 08:53.120
 the outcome, the final score. And it does look as though there will be an EUA for the Pfizer

08:53.120 --> 08:58.400
 vaccine. And the discussion was just about what will be the definition, what will be the confines

08:58.400 --> 09:03.840
 of that. So, we'll go through a couple of things here. But before we get into vaccines,

09:04.560 --> 09:09.360
 I want to point out we're getting here near the end. You know, we're in the 11th hour. I know

09:09.360 --> 09:15.440
 everyone's exhausted, but I want to tell a story. And hopefully this story is something that maybe

09:15.440 --> 09:20.800
 gives people a little bit of thought about, my gosh, I've got to keep safe because we're almost

09:20.800 --> 09:27.600
 there. So, this is a story that I asked my mother to retell this past week. And it's the story of

09:27.600 --> 09:35.920
 my grandfather's best friend, my mother's godfather, Howard Miller. And this takes place. It's 1945.

09:35.920 --> 09:42.320
 This is a true story. Howard Miller is at the Rhine River in Europe, right? It's World War II.

09:42.320 --> 09:47.680
 He's a captain in the second armored tank division. I don't know if people realize,

09:47.680 --> 09:53.840
 but 1945, that was when World War II finally ended. So World War II had just come to an end in

09:53.840 --> 10:00.720
 European theater. News of the German surrender is spreading across Europe. This day in 1945,

10:00.720 --> 10:06.560
 Howard gets up just like any other day, not knowing that the war is already over. The news has not

10:06.560 --> 10:13.120
 gotten to him yet. He's killed by a sniper after the Germans had already surrendered. So,

10:13.120 --> 10:19.840
 I feel like this is sort of a message for our listeners. The vaccine, by the time this drops,

10:20.400 --> 10:25.600
 the vaccines are here. We're going to start rolling these out. I want people to take a moment

10:25.600 --> 10:33.360
 and realize that Tuesday, November 8, 2020 was our modern V day, our modern vaccination day.

10:34.160 --> 10:39.520
 And really this week, mankind's war against COVID started to end. And vaccinations have started in

10:39.520 --> 10:45.200
 the UK. They're going to be coming here in the US in coming days and weeks. So they're going to

10:45.200 --> 10:50.800
 be spreading around the world. All right, let's go to where we are with the vaccine. The UK started

10:50.800 --> 10:56.960
 to administer the Pfizer vaccine. Canada approved the Pfizer vaccine. And by the time this dropped,

10:56.960 --> 11:04.000
 there will be some sort of an FDA EUA for the vaccine here in the US. Right? As I sort of got

11:04.000 --> 11:08.400
 on this, there was the discussion at the FDA, not about whether or not to give approval,

11:08.400 --> 11:13.600
 but what qualifications to give approval. So was the vaccine going to be just go ahead,

11:13.600 --> 11:18.320
 everyone can have it? Or we'll talk about a couple of the issues that were being discussed.

11:18.320 --> 11:24.400
 One was, will there be a lower age? So, for instance, the first question that was put forth

11:24.960 --> 11:35.360
 was 16 years of age and up. The bulk of scientific evidence supports the safety and efficacy of

11:35.360 --> 11:42.320
 this. But then there were a couple discussions about, well, 16, 17, should we make it 18? Should

11:42.320 --> 11:48.720
 there be something about that lower limit of age? The other was, since the plans are in the US to

11:48.720 --> 11:55.360
 vaccinate high-risk individuals, so healthcare workers, long-term care facility people first.

11:56.160 --> 12:01.360
 Should the EUA be limited to those high-risk groups, allowing more data to be generated before

12:01.360 --> 12:07.200
 it goes out to a wider audience? So, we will hear what sort of the final decision is. But

12:07.200 --> 12:12.000
 little things that we've learned in the last few days here, there was a 92-page brief

12:12.640 --> 12:17.120
 that I actually have to say I enjoyed reading through. And then today was a full day. A lot

12:17.120 --> 12:22.080
 of really hard questions asked advisor, nothing surprising, nothing concerning. A couple things

12:22.080 --> 12:27.280
 we now know. The vaccine is preservative and adjuvant-free. I almost feel like that should

12:27.280 --> 12:32.240
 be on there like advertisements. People are always worried about the vaccines. Is there

12:32.240 --> 12:36.400
 some preservative in there that might cause problems? Are there adjuvants that might cause

12:36.400 --> 12:41.520
 some sort of issue? And historically, we think of vaccines without adjuvants as maybe being

12:41.520 --> 12:48.880
 safer, maybe having less issues. A couple things from the immunology front, the two-dose regimen

12:48.880 --> 12:56.640
 elicited a robust neutralization antibody response. The titers were actually comparable and higher

12:56.640 --> 13:01.040
 actually than individuals who'd recovered from COVID-19. And in addition, I got some questions

13:01.040 --> 13:09.600
 about this the other day, it generated a strong CD4 and CD8 T cell response. There was reduction

13:09.600 --> 13:16.720
 in the risk of getting COVID-19 as early as 10 days after the first dose. There were some common

13:17.760 --> 13:24.800
 reactogenicity reactions. And we're going to touch on what is reactogenicity. But most people

13:24.800 --> 13:29.600
 said, hey, at the injection site, it hurt. Got poked with a needle, was sore there. I'd say

13:29.600 --> 13:34.880
 about half the people, a little bit more felt tired for a day or two. Headache was actually quite

13:34.880 --> 13:41.280
 common. People feeling sort of muscle aches, chills, joint pain fever. Fever was about 14%.

13:43.120 --> 13:46.880
 And one of the things that I mentioned is interesting. I don't know if a lot of people

13:46.880 --> 13:54.560
 realize this, but they actually included adolescents down to the 12 and 17-year-old ages. So we had

13:54.560 --> 13:59.600
 we had data not just on the older individuals. And that was why this was being discussed.

13:59.600 --> 14:04.720
 There actually were adolescents included in the study hundreds of them. So we have data there.

14:05.520 --> 14:11.360
 Want to address some of the fears here that were addressed in the last few days. It was

14:11.360 --> 14:15.680
 noticed when they went through the thousands of people that got the vaccine that there were four

14:15.680 --> 14:22.720
 cases of Bell's palsy in the over 20,000 people that were vaccinated. This is pointed out that's

14:22.720 --> 14:27.760
 actually what we see as a background in the population. So that was not above background.

14:27.760 --> 14:31.280
 So that was not considered in any way to necessarily be associated with the vaccine.

14:33.600 --> 14:36.880
 The other, which is interesting. I don't know if people are following this, but there's this

14:36.880 --> 14:40.400
 idea that if you get the vaccine, then you'll never get pregnant. Actually, it doesn't get

14:40.400 --> 14:44.640
 the vaccinated people when I hadn't got pregnant during this short period of time. So I thought

14:44.640 --> 14:50.240
 that was kind of interesting and reassuring. There's an interesting, and I'm going to talk

14:50.240 --> 14:54.880
 about reactogenicity here. So let's define the word first, and then I'll get more into it. So our

14:54.880 --> 15:02.880
 words for today are going to be reactogenicity, anaphylactic, and anaphylactoid. So reactogenicity

15:02.880 --> 15:08.800
 is basically the evidence you get that your immune system is responding to the vaccine. So that

15:08.800 --> 15:13.840
 might be local redness, soreness at the site of injection. That might be that feeling kind of

15:13.840 --> 15:19.360
 a little crummy. And if our listeners have gotten a shingle shot, this seems to be a very similar

15:19.360 --> 15:24.960
 experience. One of the concerns that people had is, Oh my gosh, if I get the vaccine,

15:24.960 --> 15:29.280
 I'll be out of work for two days. I don't think we're seeing that. That's not what we're seeing,

15:29.280 --> 15:33.120
 but it'll be great to have personal experience where we can talk to people who've gotten it and

15:33.120 --> 15:37.280
 actually say, you know, Francis, Dr. Griffin, were you laying on your back for two days? Because I

15:37.280 --> 15:43.040
 have a very low discomfort tolerance. There was sort of the interesting, you know, several young

15:43.040 --> 15:48.560
 men were claiming that they got such bad chills from the ultra cold vaccine, that they were shaking

15:48.560 --> 15:52.880
 so hard that their teeth were shattering and cracking their teeth. I tried to explain that

15:52.880 --> 15:56.880
 the vaccine is brought up to room temperature before you get it. So that seems entertaining

15:56.880 --> 16:02.640
 more than anything. But the other, and this has come up anaphylactic versus anaphylactoid.

16:03.280 --> 16:08.240
 And so I immediately got a call yesterday morning from one of the allergists in our area.

16:09.360 --> 16:14.640
 And there was a concern, a couple of the people in the UK who got the vaccine had allergic reactions,

16:14.640 --> 16:20.560
 right? And the difference here is between anaphylactic and anaphylactoid. So anaphylactic

16:20.560 --> 16:26.800
 is when you have antibodies, you get something, it triggers this severe reaction. Anaphylactoid

16:26.800 --> 16:31.280
 is more along the lines of what was being described, something where they got Benadryl.

16:31.280 --> 16:37.200
 It was a non-immunoglobulin mediated allergic reaction. There's discussion that here in the

16:37.200 --> 16:43.520
 states, if someone has a history of issues like that, we might suggest taking Benadryl before the

16:43.520 --> 16:48.080
 vaccine. And the way I was talking about that, should there be some kind of qualification

16:48.800 --> 16:53.920
 about people that have a history of anaphylactoid allergic reactions to things,

16:55.200 --> 17:02.640
 maybe just sort of alerting people. So I will move forward from there to what is really on the top

17:02.640 --> 17:06.160
 of people's mind, actually, I have to say. I know in the media, they're talking a lot about

17:06.160 --> 17:12.240
 vaccine hesitancy. But at this point, we're in the less vaccine relative to demand.

17:12.240 --> 17:17.760
 Some point will be into some other concerns. And this is an area where now we're talking about

17:17.760 --> 17:23.120
 equitable distribution. And so who gets the vaccine first? And the world is watching, right? So we

17:23.120 --> 17:29.120
 want to make sure we do this the right way. So I'm going to talk specifically about New York

17:29.120 --> 17:35.520
 States vaccination program, because the way it works, right, is the ultimate decisions are going

17:35.520 --> 17:40.720
 to be based at the New York State Department of Health. And we've been getting updates on this.

17:40.720 --> 17:47.520
 So high-risk healthcare workers, nursing home residents, and staff will be the first New Yorkers

17:47.520 --> 17:52.960
 to receive the vaccine. So what does that mean? So what are high-risk hospital workers? Not everyone

17:52.960 --> 17:58.480
 in the hospital is at the same risk. Emergency room workers, right? Particularly, we'll say

17:58.480 --> 18:03.440
 nurses, non-physicians, right? I think they spend a lot more time. I think anyone has ever interacted

18:03.440 --> 18:06.800
 with the healthcare profession. Your nurse spends a lot more time with you than the doctor.

18:06.800 --> 18:15.040
 So the nurses, the doctors, all the support staff, similar ICU. So all the ICU staff,

18:15.600 --> 18:21.600
 nurses, all the assistants, the pulmonary department staff, and New York State expects

18:21.600 --> 18:27.040
 all high-risk hospital staff. We'll get the vaccine actually within the next week or two,

18:27.040 --> 18:32.560
 right? So we're expecting to get vaccine here in New York next week, if this, well, when the EU

18:32.560 --> 18:38.000
 goes through, which we all expect. And then it's going to follow, right? It's going to go very

18:38.000 --> 18:45.120
 quickly to the long-term and congregative care staff and the residents there. And it's going

18:45.120 --> 18:50.800
 to be interesting, who's giving the vaccine to whom? So the big pharmacy chains have stepped up

18:50.800 --> 18:57.920
 across the nation. So CVS, Walgreens, I realize correction, Dwayne Reed is the drugstore, Dwayne

18:57.920 --> 19:04.720
 Johnson is the rock, but throw that in there. And then it's going to move out to other physicians,

19:04.720 --> 19:08.800
 other staff working in the hospital, and then it'll move out to essential workers, general

19:08.800 --> 19:14.000
 population, et cetera. But this is an interesting, I'm going to tell another little story here

19:14.000 --> 19:20.880
 about who gets first. So I was having a conversation earlier this week with the majority leader of

19:20.880 --> 19:28.960
 one of the legislative bodies here in our great country. It was not Nancy Pelosi. And this gentleman

19:28.960 --> 19:33.680
 was saying to me, well, you know, Dr. Griffith, it's obviously a no-brainer that we got to get

19:33.680 --> 19:38.640
 these vaccines to the hospitals. Because, you know, when you get COVID-19, that's where people go.

19:39.520 --> 19:44.400
 And he told me a story about how a secret service individual, you know, was talking,

19:44.400 --> 19:48.080
 there's a couple of aspects that I think they're really interesting to our listeners. One is

19:48.080 --> 19:52.400
 saying, you know, the secret service person, you know, where in the gloves, where in the mask,

19:52.400 --> 19:58.240
 he's very safe at work. So it isn't that we're thinking that it's a risk for the hospital workers

19:58.240 --> 20:03.920
 being in the hospital, though I think it is. What happened in this case was this individual's

20:03.920 --> 20:09.680
 child got infected, the wife got infected, he got infected. And now a critical person

20:10.480 --> 20:14.480
 is sick and going to the hospital. So we had a little bit of a discussion. I was actually

20:14.480 --> 20:19.760
 surprised. I think our listeners know this, but I pointed out that the majority of people who get

20:19.760 --> 20:25.680
 COVID never actually go to the hospital, that 80, 85% of people we care for in the community.

20:25.680 --> 20:30.800
 So raising the issue that as we look at the critical people that we need to make sure we

20:30.800 --> 20:35.040
 keep them healthy and protected, we've got to be looking at our primary care docs.

20:35.040 --> 20:38.720
 We've got to be looking at the people that work in the urgent care centers.

20:38.720 --> 20:42.400
 And not just the doctors, right? Think about the receptionist who's working there at the

20:42.400 --> 20:47.520
 urgent care or the busy primary care practice. Think about the nurses, the medical assistants.

20:48.320 --> 20:52.800
 Basically saying if we don't protect those people, if we can't keep them healthy enough to take

20:52.800 --> 20:58.480
 care of that 80% that we manage in the outpatient setting, and we leave them with just the ER as a

20:58.480 --> 21:03.200
 place to get care, we're going to drown. So it's a very interesting conversation as we go forward,

21:03.200 --> 21:10.240
 we'll hear more about how this all works. And I'll be talking more about our, we'll say our

21:10.240 --> 21:18.640
 pro-health riverside tri-state vaccine initiative. But once we get past these easy to vaccinate

21:18.640 --> 21:23.440
 people, I think, people working in the hospitals, urgent cares, medical practices, long-term care

21:23.440 --> 21:28.720
 facilities, I say easy. More challenging is we going out to the communities, right?

21:29.680 --> 21:35.840
 When we move from phase one, right, to these high-risk individuals, when we start moving to

21:35.840 --> 21:42.640
 people that are 65 and older, when we start moving to teachers, critical workers, so police,

21:42.640 --> 21:48.480
 firefighters, et cetera, you'll be hearing more about a lot of organizations like ours are jumping

21:48.480 --> 21:53.120
 in, reaching out to the state saying, we'll be a solution. We'll produce high-throughput

21:53.840 --> 21:59.040
 vaccination access sites where people can do drive through like we did back with the H1

21:59.040 --> 22:04.000
 and N1 vaccinations. Let's get as many people vaccinated and protected so we can move forward.

22:04.000 --> 22:10.720
 All right. Now let's move. I'm going to skip a little bit past that incubation period.

22:11.680 --> 22:17.280
 Actually, I won't skip so much. The CDC updated things where they basically said once you've

22:17.280 --> 22:23.840
 been exposed at day seven, if you've got a negative test within 48 hours, you can end that quarantine

22:23.840 --> 22:29.680
 a little bit earlier. We haven't quite embraced that in New York City or New York State, so

22:29.680 --> 22:34.000
 we're still stretching out the full thing, or at least we're recommending. No one's listening.

22:34.000 --> 22:39.600
 We're aware of that. But once you actually go ahead and actually get detectable virus, what do you

22:39.600 --> 22:45.520
 do? Or what do you do if you think that's the case? And the NIH has a nice page now really

22:45.520 --> 22:51.760
 basically pointing out that testing saves lives. So when I was talking about how we're going to roll

22:51.760 --> 22:56.640
 out the vaccines, I was talking to a lot of our urgent cares. Some of our urgent care centers

22:56.640 --> 23:02.720
 are doing over 6,000 COVID tests a day per site. I mean, this is really amazing.

23:03.440 --> 23:07.680
 And if you look at our positivity rate being five or six percent, I'm going to do five percent.

23:07.680 --> 23:13.760
 The math is easier. You're talking about 300 people testing positive at one of these sites,

23:13.760 --> 23:18.480
 each of these sites per day. This was huge when we went into Thanksgiving.

23:18.480 --> 23:23.840
 All of those people testing positive being pulled out and not going to that Thanksgiving dinner.

23:23.840 --> 23:27.680
 Think of all the contagion that you're stopping by identifying people who are positive.

23:28.400 --> 23:33.520
 So this is really critical. And there's really a push. Now, don't just get tested when you have

23:33.520 --> 23:39.920
 symptoms. Testing saves lives. It identifies the spread before it happens. And this is really

23:39.920 --> 23:44.960
 critical in being embraced. And actually, a lot of people, I think it's taken a little bit longer

23:44.960 --> 23:51.200
 than it needed to, but embracing rapid resulting. So what are we doing? This is sort of a four doctors.

23:51.200 --> 23:57.280
 We're doing rapid antigen testing at most of our sites. We do Abbott ID now at some of them as well.

23:57.280 --> 24:04.640
 We often send off a PCR as well. What sometimes happens, right? 6,000 tests. You don't tell everyone

24:04.640 --> 24:10.960
 to sort of quarantine while you're waiting for that PCR. But some of the time that antigen test

24:10.960 --> 24:16.320
 is coming back negative, but the PCR is coming back positive. We're catching some people in that

24:16.320 --> 24:21.840
 ramp up phase. We're catching some people sort of after the fact in the ramp down phase.

24:22.800 --> 24:29.360
 But what we're doing then is basically calling them up. Your PCR came back positive and then

24:29.360 --> 24:34.160
 sort of moving forward with that. So that's going to happen. When you're doing 6,000 tests per site

24:34.160 --> 24:39.520
 per day, a certain number of those negative antigen tests are going to be people that are early

24:39.520 --> 24:45.280
 enough in disease that you're getting a few hours before that antigen test term is positive.

24:45.280 --> 24:53.280
 So the early inflammatory phase. This I touched on a little bit above and just to reiterate,

24:53.280 --> 24:58.880
 it was actually interesting when I was talking to the majority leader. He was shocked when I said

24:58.880 --> 25:02.720
 that 80% of people are managed outside the hospital. They actually challenged me. Where did you come

25:02.720 --> 25:07.600
 up with that number? I was a little surprised, actually. But I think that as someone told me,

25:07.600 --> 25:14.160
 well, 80% of the focus has been on the hospitals. People are not aware of all the people out there.

25:14.160 --> 25:22.160
 When you look at 240,000 people in a single day being diagnosed with COVID,

25:22.160 --> 25:26.480
 they're not all going to the hospital. If anything, we're getting above that 80%. We're getting

25:26.480 --> 25:31.120
 better and better at managing these people outside the hospital. So what are we doing?

25:32.000 --> 25:37.120
 We're still recommending the first week, just symptomatic management. We've eased up. You can

25:37.120 --> 25:43.440
 take your leave, your ibuprofen, your Tylenol to treat those viral symptoms. We are encouraging

25:43.440 --> 25:49.200
 people to wait until the second week to consider steroids. We're limiting steroids to people who

25:49.200 --> 25:54.560
 have issues with their oxygen level dropping. Actually here in New York, we're setting people

25:54.560 --> 26:02.480
 home with post-oximeters, 15, $20. That's a good way for us to then manage them. Just speaking to

26:02.480 --> 26:07.760
 a physician friend of mine who's in that second week where each day we're checking in to see where

26:07.760 --> 26:12.640
 his post-ox is. It's in the high 90s still. As long as it stays in the high 90s, he'll continue

26:12.640 --> 26:18.560
 to take his aspirin a day, try to stay active, stay off the steroids, stay off the antibiotics,

26:19.360 --> 26:24.400
 and just manage them outside the hospital. This is critical because you can't send everyone with

26:24.400 --> 26:30.880
 COVID and a fever to the ERs. You can overwhelm the system and when you do that, no one benefits.

26:32.320 --> 26:39.040
 We did see the formal, peer-reviewed publication of the repurposed antiviral drugs for COVID-19

26:39.040 --> 26:45.200
 interim, WHO, solitary trial results that came out in the New England Journal on the second.

26:45.920 --> 26:52.320
 Again, this is where they looked at remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, lopinovir, interferon regimens,

26:53.920 --> 27:00.640
 and really did not show any overwhelming compelling evidence for mortality,

27:00.640 --> 27:05.840
 initiation of ventilation, duration of hospital stay. This is an interesting issue because the

27:05.840 --> 27:11.600
 first of those in there was remdesivir, right? A lot of the hospital systems have purchased

27:11.600 --> 27:16.720
 large orders of remdesivir here in the United States. I'm actually seeing people get admitted

27:16.720 --> 27:21.920
 just for remdesivir, even though they're not hypoxic. I think this is a decision people have

27:21.920 --> 27:28.160
 to make. Is the benefit of remdesivir enough that it's worth hospitalizing someone just for that

27:28.160 --> 27:34.240
 therapy? Because originally, the idea is it shortened your hospital stay. Here, I have people

27:34.240 --> 27:40.400
 getting admitted to the hospital without hypoxia just to get the remdesivir. Here, it's creating a

27:40.400 --> 27:45.200
 five-day hospital stay versus shortening a hospital stay. Something to think about there.

27:45.760 --> 27:51.440
 We continue to see secondary infections later on. The multi-inflammatory phase,

27:51.440 --> 27:57.600
 I think I mentioned last time the individual with the Guian Barre. We gave them the intravenous

27:57.600 --> 28:03.040
 immunoglobulin. A few days later, he's squeezing my hands, but then he actually started to get

28:03.040 --> 28:08.240
 flasset again. This continues to be a challenge. I have another gentleman. I'm not sure the

28:08.240 --> 28:14.160
 connection here, but he was a gentleman who had COVID and then at about week four developed an

28:14.160 --> 28:20.400
 expressive aphasia. Really unclear what that is, but the timing is concerning for a connection there.

28:21.360 --> 28:28.720
 A number of papers out there, case reports, suggested a connection. What is expressive aphasia?

28:28.720 --> 28:34.560
 This is a gentleman where I ask him questions. I go for a while until finally I hit an area,

28:34.560 --> 28:40.000
 and he just can't get the words out. He can't tell me. I'll ask him where he works,

28:40.560 --> 28:45.440
 and it comes out gibberish. If I let him just talk on his own, he could talk. It sounds like he's

28:45.440 --> 28:52.480
 fine. Then I say, you work at GBP. What does GBP stand for? When he tries to say GBP, it just comes

28:52.480 --> 28:58.320
 out. I ask him, do you know what GBP stands for? He nods. He knows what. He just can't get it

28:58.320 --> 29:05.680
 expressed. Really a challenge. I'm going to sort of wrap out here with our tail phase,

29:05.680 --> 29:10.240
 but in the tail phase, I want to talk a little bit about challenges we're having with DC planning

29:10.240 --> 29:18.320
 now. The tail phase is very recognized, continues to be a huge problem. Actually, one of the questions

29:18.320 --> 29:23.120
 I just got from this physician colleague was his wife, his son. They're both sick. They're an

29:23.120 --> 29:28.640
 urgent care waiting to get tested. Should he wait? Should they bother getting that test? My advice

29:28.640 --> 29:34.480
 was yes, get that test. We need that objective evidence. But one of the issues that came up

29:34.480 --> 29:41.280
 is currently COVID is considered an acute diagnosis, not a chronic. One of the nurses that I've talked

29:41.280 --> 29:47.120
 about several times is having issues getting disability coverage because they say COVID is an

29:47.120 --> 29:52.800
 acute diagnosis. You had that back in March, April. It's not a chronic disease. If you're going to

29:52.800 --> 29:58.480
 look for any kind of support, you need a chronic diagnosis. It's interesting. This has also become

29:58.480 --> 30:03.680
 an issue for oxygen. We have a number of individuals in the hospital. We're looking at trying to

30:03.680 --> 30:09.840
 discharge them, but oxygen is only paid for if you have a chronic condition requiring oxygen.

30:10.480 --> 30:15.120
 Back in March, April, the early days of the pandemic, the governor stepped in. Executive

30:15.120 --> 30:22.240
 orders basically said everyone has to cover and supply oxygen for COVID. Interesting that we're

30:22.240 --> 30:29.440
 seeing bureaucracy stand in the way of what we recommend as good care. I think the governor listens

30:29.440 --> 30:36.160
 to us, Vincent, so he can maybe jump in and give us some help on that. But before we take emails,

30:36.160 --> 30:41.360
 let me just say we're continuing to our support of the Peace Corps, HIV and AIDS programs.

30:41.360 --> 30:46.240
 Just to point out, we are in the midst of this pandemic. I hope when we get through

30:46.240 --> 30:51.280
 the other side, people don't forget about COVID-19 so that we don't go into this unprepared like we

30:51.280 --> 30:56.800
 did this time. But there's still a huge pandemic going on. We have not really gotten through the

30:56.800 --> 31:03.440
 HIV pandemic. And so go to parasiteswithoutborders.com, help us support them, but also help us continue

31:03.440 --> 31:09.360
 our mission. Daniel, have you seen an uptick in influenza cases yet this season?

31:09.360 --> 31:17.600
 So there are more influenza cases. There is an increase, but it is actually a much lower

31:17.600 --> 31:23.680
 percent of cases, a slower number of cases of influenza this season than we previously. Usually

31:23.680 --> 31:28.880
 now is when we start seeing all these flu admissions. But I think all the things we're doing is keeping

31:28.880 --> 31:34.240
 flu at a lower level. That's great. That's good. This one maybe one silver lining, right?

31:34.240 --> 31:41.280
 Yes. All right, we have some email. Remember everybody you can send an email to Daniel at

31:41.280 --> 31:48.400
 microbe.tv. And we've got a lot, but we'll just do a couple here today. This is from Sean. I'm an

31:48.400 --> 31:55.200
 orthopedic surgeon in New Orleans and have a friend who's an internist who treats COVID patients.

31:57.840 --> 32:00.960
 Yeah, I'm not sure that's what he's supposed to be doing, right? But

32:00.960 --> 32:07.040
 he's on regular zoom call clinical updates. He told me that dexamethasone is no longer

32:07.040 --> 32:11.440
 recommended to treat COVID. This seems to contradict everything I've learned so far about how dex

32:11.440 --> 32:16.080
 is one of the best therapeutics we have. What do you think? Well, I think it's his friend,

32:16.080 --> 32:21.040
 the internist who's taking care of the people. So that's good. That's what we want. As I mentioned,

32:21.040 --> 32:26.640
 80%, 85%, the majority of people with COVID do not need an infectious disease specialist.

32:26.640 --> 32:30.480
 They don't need to go to the hospital. This is something everyone should feel comfortable

32:30.480 --> 32:36.320
 managing the outpatient setting in most cases. We usually, as I point out, we don't give dexameth

32:36.320 --> 32:40.800
 zone to everyone. It isn't like connect the dots. It isn't COVID dexamethasone.

32:40.800 --> 32:46.080
 dexamethasone is reserved for the class for which it was shown to make a difference.

32:46.080 --> 32:49.840
 And these are people who are starting to develop the early inflammatory response.

32:49.840 --> 32:56.000
 It's during the second week. And it's people who are starting to get hypoxic, right? So if you're

32:56.000 --> 33:00.880
 not hypoxic, if your sats are still in the 90s and you're doing well in the outpatient setting,

33:01.600 --> 33:05.440
 or even it's the first week, don't give them steroids. Steroids is something that we should be

33:05.440 --> 33:12.160
 giving to only a select number of individuals. Is the mortality benefit huge? No, the absolute

33:12.160 --> 33:16.720
 benefit is only a couple percent in people with low oxygen requirement, a little bit higher in

33:16.720 --> 33:24.240
 people who are more serious disease. But yeah, it's not for everyone. There's a certain place for it.

33:24.240 --> 33:33.840
 Okay, we have an email from anonymous in Manchester, UK, who is worried about their dad in Australia.

33:34.560 --> 33:39.520
 Her dad had a flu vaccine 30 years ago and developed Guillain-Barre syndrome.

33:40.640 --> 33:46.880
 So anonymous wants to know, is there a reason my dad or anyone like him to worry about any of the

33:46.880 --> 33:54.320
 COVID-19 vaccines or candidates, no longer gets flu shots? And should I worry since I am, you know,

33:54.320 --> 34:02.800
 that's my father. You know, so this has come up quite a bit. And you know, questions about

34:02.800 --> 34:09.280
 the vaccine, should I worry about Guillain-Barre? And actually, I think the flu is a perfect example.

34:09.280 --> 34:14.640
 We look at people who get natural infection with influenza versus people who get the influenza

34:14.640 --> 34:19.200
 vaccine and the incidence of Guillain-Barre is certainly higher with getting natural infection

34:19.200 --> 34:24.080
 from influenza. So sort of an interesting thing in a perfect world, there's no influenza, there's

34:24.080 --> 34:30.560
 no influenza shot and there's less Guillain-Barre. But yeah, I've certainly seen it in natural

34:30.560 --> 34:35.280
 infection with influenza, I've also seen it after a flu shot. But is this going to be an issue for

34:35.280 --> 34:42.320
 people who get the different vaccines for COVID? So far, we're not seeing a signal. Pretty soon,

34:42.320 --> 34:47.760
 we're going to be having millions of people vaccinated. So by the time, you know, it rolls

34:47.760 --> 34:51.040
 out to other individuals, I think there's going to be more data to help us with this.

34:52.880 --> 34:57.280
 The next emails from a nurse in a New York City hospital who's been trying to get pregnant for

34:57.280 --> 35:04.400
 some months and wonders if she should wait until after vaccination, because the vaccines, I think,

35:04.400 --> 35:07.520
 are not being tested in pregnant women. What do you think, Dan?

35:07.520 --> 35:12.640
 Yeah, no, I think that's, yeah, no, excellent. I'm going to say, you know, interfere with your

35:12.640 --> 35:17.680
 family planning decisions here. Tell your husband to curse me if he wants to have a child immediately.

35:18.240 --> 35:24.720
 But as we saw, they excluded pregnant women in the vaccine trials as a nurse in a New York City

35:24.720 --> 35:32.240
 hospital. You're right here in phase 1A, potentially going to get vaccinated in the next few weeks,

35:32.240 --> 35:36.640
 right? And after the 10 days, you'll have some protection. Three weeks later, you get your second

35:36.640 --> 35:41.920
 dose and then you're good to go. We certainly saw people go ahead and get pregnant once they

35:41.920 --> 35:46.240
 had been vaccinated. I think I mentioned there were a dozen women that went ahead and did that

35:46.240 --> 35:51.840
 in the Pfizer trial. So yeah, just, you know, wait, wait a few weeks, you know, and then go ahead.

35:51.840 --> 35:59.120
 That would make sense. You hate to go ahead and, you know, not get vaccinated, you know, when you

35:59.120 --> 36:03.440
 could be really mad or just postponing that pregnancy by a few weeks. So that's my advice,

36:03.440 --> 36:06.560
 but I'm going to leave the ultimate decision up to you and your partner.

36:07.760 --> 36:12.720
 All right, we have the last two are the same question. We have a question from

36:12.720 --> 36:19.440
 the FISA and Katherine, whether immune compromised people can be vaccinated.

36:21.120 --> 36:25.520
 So that's an excellent question. So a lot of people are asking about this. And, you know,

36:25.520 --> 36:31.440
 there's a certain sophistication to mRNA vaccines and concerns about people with autoimmune diseases.

36:31.440 --> 36:37.440
 And when you make the RNA vaccines, right, you're basically taking DNA, you're going over to RNA,

36:37.440 --> 36:42.880
 and some of the products will be double stranded RNA. So they're early vaccines or the early trials

36:42.880 --> 36:46.480
 when they're going through this, they've realized that you were making contaminants of double

36:46.480 --> 36:50.160
 stranded DNA. And you really don't want that, right? That's potentially something we worry

36:50.160 --> 36:56.320
 could trigger autoimmunity. So they do a really careful chromatography process. They purify and

36:56.320 --> 37:02.880
 make sure it's just straight RNA. At least what we're seeing so far, I think it looks like it's

37:02.880 --> 37:08.640
 going to be okay to use in these individuals. It is not a live vaccine. That's good. It has sort

37:08.640 --> 37:16.080
 of less stuff in there. So we're anticipating that this might be a safer approach. And I throw

37:16.080 --> 37:20.640
 that in. Not only am I, at this point, saying like the RNA vaccines, but we have a couple other

37:20.640 --> 37:26.800
 vaccines on the horizon, the Chinese with their inactivated, Sino farm. That's one that was what,

37:26.800 --> 37:32.800
 86% efficacy, they tell us, we'll see the actual data on that. We've got Johnson and Johnson coming

37:32.800 --> 37:38.560
 out either this month or January, actually, so much COVID in the States, Jay and Jay said they

37:38.560 --> 37:44.480
 don't have to have 60,000 people. Looks like they'll probably stop at 40,000, just this so much COVID.

37:44.480 --> 37:48.960
 And then we'll see even more. But yeah, as we go forward, we're not expecting there to be a problem

37:48.960 --> 37:54.720
 here. We like the idea that it's not a, should I say live vaccine, I'll say active replicating

37:54.720 --> 37:59.200
 virus that we're injecting people. This is really just that sticky note with instructions for how

37:59.200 --> 38:03.840
 your immune system should respond. And we are thinking and the data seems to be supporting that

38:03.840 --> 38:09.200
 this will be a safer technology. So right now, if you're say one of these first-line people who

38:09.200 --> 38:13.520
 are going to be vaccinated next week, and you have an immune compromise, are they going to give it

38:13.520 --> 38:21.200
 to you or no? It'll be on a case by case basis. Okay, there's no general rule. Very good. All right,

38:21.200 --> 38:30.320
 that's our 40th from weekly COVID-19 clinical update with Dr. Daniel Griffin. Thanks again, Daniel.

38:30.320 --> 38:44.160
 Oh, thank you so much. Everyone be safe.
