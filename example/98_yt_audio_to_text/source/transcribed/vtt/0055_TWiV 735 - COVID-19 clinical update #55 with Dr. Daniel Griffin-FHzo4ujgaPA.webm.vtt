 This week in virology, the podcast about viruses, the kind that make you sick.

00:10.240 --> 00:21.520
 From Microbe TV, this is Twiv, this week in virology, episode 735 recorded on March 25th, 2021.

00:22.080 --> 00:26.640
 I'm Vincent Draconiello, and you're listening to the podcast All About Viruses.

00:26.640 --> 00:34.480
 Joining me today from New York, Daniel Griffin. Hello, everyone. How's it going this week, Daniel?

00:36.160 --> 00:43.600
 We are sitting on this plateau that we seem unable to get off of. As quickly as we vaccinate,

00:44.240 --> 00:53.680
 everything opens back up, so it's a constant battle. And I have to say, that's the good news,

00:53.680 --> 01:00.240
 right? Because around the world, the numbers seem to be increasing. So, here we are a year into

01:00.240 --> 01:06.240
 this, and over a year into this, and we are not where we need to be. But let's be honest,

01:06.240 --> 01:11.360
 I was listening to another podcast that said I was cheating on you, listening to other people's

01:11.360 --> 01:19.440
 podcasts. It's okay. And it was actually Anthony Fauci was talking, it was 1984.

01:19.440 --> 01:25.120
 And he was saying, we have the virus, we know the sequence, I expect to get back to you within

01:25.120 --> 01:34.320
 the year with a cure and a vaccine. And I was like 16 plus 37 years ago. So, this is miraculous,

01:34.320 --> 01:40.400
 right? Then we went in less than a year from a sequence to a vaccine. But it's not miraculous.

01:40.400 --> 01:47.280
 This is science. This is all that, did I say basic science that we spent all this money

01:47.280 --> 01:55.040
 investing in? My quotation, every great dream begins with a dreamer. Always remember, you have

01:55.040 --> 02:01.120
 within you the strength, the patience and the passion to reach for the stars to change the world.

02:02.000 --> 02:06.320
 And that was Harriet Tubman. And I think maybe that's sort of appropriate with what we were

02:06.320 --> 02:14.880
 just saying. This really has been tremendous over the last year to go from identifying that

02:14.880 --> 02:21.360
 some people are dying from a strange illness unidentified to understanding the etiology

02:21.360 --> 02:28.560
 to a really impressive vaccine. We haven't done quite so well in other measures as far as

02:28.560 --> 02:32.960
 therapeutics, but the vaccine has really been quite impressive. So I'll make sure I spend a

02:32.960 --> 02:38.080
 little time talking about that today. But my rules never miss an opportunity to vaccinate,

02:38.080 --> 02:45.920
 never miss an opportunity to test, never waste a vaccine dose. So I'm going to title today's

02:45.920 --> 02:52.800
 episode, school shots and cocktails. I'm not sure how schools fit in with the shots and cocktails,

02:52.800 --> 02:57.600
 but the shots and cocktails I call is the Irish method for ending the pandemic.

02:57.600 --> 03:03.920
 So there have been a few ID society, ID essay, ID society of America updates.

03:03.920 --> 03:08.880
 So I'm going to sort of pepper those in as we get there. But there also were some nice

03:08.880 --> 03:15.680
 reports from the CDC on schools. So in our section, children and COVID, let's start there.

03:16.320 --> 03:21.760
 I mentioned last week that I was not particularly impressed with the Massachusetts study. That was

03:21.760 --> 03:27.520
 the three six foot study. That was not even quite observational. But I did intimate that there was

03:27.520 --> 03:33.840
 good data out there, and that we had the suggestion that we would be getting more of it and the CDC

03:33.840 --> 03:41.360
 delivered on their promise. The MMWR, COVID-19 in primary and secondary school settings,

03:41.360 --> 03:47.120
 during the first semester of school reopening, Florida, August through December 2020.

03:47.120 --> 03:54.560
 So this was a report looking at close to 3 million registered students that were enrolled in approximately

03:54.560 --> 04:02.240
 6,800 public charter and private K through 12 schools range from a small size, maybe 707

04:02.240 --> 04:07.920
 to over 300,000 students per school district. And most of these schools had actually resumed

04:07.920 --> 04:15.840
 in-person instruction sometime during August of 2020, except for those in two of the largest

04:15.840 --> 04:21.200
 school districts. Broward and Miami-Dade, which began remote learning in August, but did not resume

04:21.200 --> 04:26.560
 in-person instruction until October 9th and then November 10th, respectively.

04:26.560 --> 04:33.520
 Statewide, as of September 24th, almost half 45% of registered students received full-time

04:33.520 --> 04:39.680
 in-person instruction. So really, the question here was, how did that go? So to assess the occurrence

04:39.680 --> 04:46.800
 of COVID-19 in the Florida schools after resumption of in-person instruction, the CDC and the Florida

04:46.800 --> 04:52.640
 Department of Health reviewed school-related cases and outbreaks during August through December

04:52.640 --> 04:58.560
 of 2020. And the County Health Department's staff members conducted case investigations

04:59.280 --> 05:06.000
 and contact tracing for all COVID-19 cases. So this was, I have to say, there was a lot of rigor

05:06.000 --> 05:11.760
 here. They were really looking into this and they found that fewer than 1% of registered

05:11.760 --> 05:17.600
 students were identified as having school-related COVID-19. So significant findings were that most

05:17.600 --> 05:23.440
 of the identified cases in this age group were not school exposure-related. And I know I've brought

05:23.440 --> 05:29.120
 this up on some talks. Parents get upset when I suggest that perhaps the children are safer in

05:29.120 --> 05:34.480
 the schools than sometimes they are at home. But it is not apparent in common. It's that your child

05:34.480 --> 05:40.640
 is home all day socially isolated. There's a tendency for the kids then to get together after

05:40.640 --> 05:46.320
 that period of remote learning. One of the comments here is that masks being mandated

05:47.040 --> 05:53.200
 was associated with less transmission. And that was a p-value of less than 0.01. And the other

05:53.200 --> 05:57.440
 thing that was a predictor was community case rates. So once community case rates started to go up,

05:57.440 --> 06:02.400
 this was associated with a higher risk. And that had an even more significant p-value of less than

06:02.400 --> 06:09.200
 0.01. There was another study. And actually, I've been a few, but just to highlight another one,

06:09.200 --> 06:17.200
 low SARS-CoV-2 transmission in elementary schools, Salt Lake County, Utah, December 3, 2020 through

06:17.200 --> 06:24.000
 January 31, 2021. And here, there were very similar findings, including low school associated

06:24.000 --> 06:31.680
 transmission with high mask adherence and classroom seat separation of three feet apart.

06:32.320 --> 06:36.960
 So I know here in, I have to say right here in North Shore of Long Island, our schools are

06:36.960 --> 06:45.520
 getting ready to open up for fall in person next month in April. They're looking at the three feet.

06:45.520 --> 06:52.560
 And as I mentioned, the three feet is something that's really required for getting people back

06:52.560 --> 06:57.360
 to fall in person school. Very few parts of our country have the real estate, the size,

06:57.360 --> 07:04.320
 the space to do six foot spacing. And the data I suggested last time is you get about E percent

07:04.320 --> 07:10.240
 of the benefit at three feet. You get down to 90% reduction by six feet, but you get most of that

07:10.800 --> 07:15.520
 bang for the buck in the first three feet. You couple that with masks, you couple that with

07:15.520 --> 07:22.000
 upgraded ventilation systems. You add testing. And I think that this, again, this is something

07:22.000 --> 07:29.760
 that can be done at low risk. So we're getting more data. This is a science driven recommendation.

07:29.760 --> 07:37.920
 Testing, the CDC updated its guidance on testing. So I know there's been a lot of focus on vaccines.

07:37.920 --> 07:43.120
 And we've forgotten about our poor tests, but there are key points in the updated recommendations.

07:43.120 --> 07:49.600
 So one, they said persons with signs or symptoms of COVID-19 should have diagnostic testing.

07:50.160 --> 07:56.240
 I know there's a tendency to give out the presumptive diagnosis, but we really want to confirm these.

07:56.240 --> 08:00.880
 And so the CDC is really saying, get people tested, document what's going on here.

08:00.880 --> 08:09.040
 Rapid point of care, serial screening can identify asymptomatic cases and helped interrupt SARS-CoV-2

08:09.040 --> 08:13.440
 transmission. They're going to say this is especially important when community risk or

08:13.440 --> 08:20.400
 transmission levels are substantial or high. And this sort of goes into that frequency.

08:20.400 --> 08:26.480
 And rapid results are really critical. What gets us into trouble are these resulting delays. They

08:26.480 --> 08:32.800
 really have in the CDC coming out here really endorsing the use of rapid point of care tests.

08:33.680 --> 08:40.000
 These are being used so by clinicians across the board and then making a judgment. If it's

08:40.000 --> 08:45.680
 positive and it makes sense, great. If it's negative and doesn't make sense, looking at PCR,

08:45.680 --> 08:51.440
 looking at make decisions about isolation, quarantining, etc. The selection and interpretation

08:51.440 --> 08:57.600
 of SARS-CoV-2 tests should be based on the context in which they are being used, including the

08:57.600 --> 09:03.360
 prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 and the population being tested. So testing gets a little sophisticated,

09:03.360 --> 09:08.400
 as we've talked about. There's negative and positive predictive values, which are maybe more

09:08.400 --> 09:14.560
 important than sensitivity and specificity as really sensitivity, specificity need to be

09:14.560 --> 09:19.920
 brought into the context of prevalence, which ultimately tells you when a test is positive or

09:19.920 --> 09:24.800
 negative, how confident can you be in that result? And then this, I think, is really important. I

09:24.800 --> 09:30.240
 get this question quite a lot. So it's nice to get the CDC putting up something on this prior

09:30.240 --> 09:38.320
 receipt of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine will not affect the results of SARS-CoV-2 viral tests.

09:38.320 --> 09:41.920
 All right, a lot of people ask that. So I've been vaccinated, so can I even look at the test

09:41.920 --> 09:49.520
 results? And yes, you can. You can still count on these. And I will say that there is now about

09:49.520 --> 09:56.480
 $10 billion available for K through 12 schools to expand the coronavirus screening of staff and

09:56.480 --> 10:02.640
 students. And I think this was a quote, but this funding could be used for schools to offer

10:02.640 --> 10:07.920
 rapid antigen tests that generate results in 15 minutes, allowing schools to quickly respond

10:07.920 --> 10:15.280
 when students or staff test positive for the virus. And finally, our article identifying

10:15.840 --> 10:22.560
 optimal COVID-19 testing strategies for schools and businesses, balancing testing frequency,

10:22.560 --> 10:28.160
 individual test technology, and cost was published. It was actually was interesting. It was under

10:28.160 --> 10:34.640
 embargo until about 2 p.m. today. So I couldn't talk about this until, well, a few hours before

10:34.640 --> 10:39.200
 Vincent and I recorded this, but now it's fair game once this gets dropped. But this article is

10:39.200 --> 10:44.480
 an open access article in plus one. And what we're doing is trying to create paradigms,

10:45.040 --> 10:50.880
 some sort of guidance on how people can use testing in the school and actually really any

10:50.880 --> 10:55.360
 opening plan that they might have. I've been getting a lot of questions and really goes back to

10:56.320 --> 11:01.600
 the variant thing. And the question I've got lately is whether a person infected with a variant

11:01.600 --> 11:08.720
 will still have a positive COVID PCR. So I'll cover this here in the testing section. And when I

11:08.720 --> 11:14.080
 when I get this question, I usually say yes, but then I walk through the technology of the tests.

11:14.080 --> 11:20.560
 And I point out that many of the COVID PCR tests, which really should be SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests,

11:21.440 --> 11:29.600
 go to Quest or LabCorp. The Quest PCR primers target nucleic capsid. The LabCorp PCR test says

11:29.600 --> 11:36.080
 one primer set targeting nucleic capsid and another targeting the RNA dependent RNA polymerase

11:36.080 --> 11:41.600
 sequence. Therefore, a change in the sequence of the spike protein should not impact this test.

11:42.240 --> 11:46.640
 In addition to the logic here, this has actually been studied in both Quest and LabCorp have come

11:46.640 --> 11:51.520
 out saying that, yeah, this understanding translates into reality and that these tests

11:51.520 --> 11:58.480
 continue to be sensitive and specific despite changes in the sequence of the spike protein.

11:58.480 --> 12:03.280
 So as I say, the test still gives you a positive result, even if your infection is with a variant,

12:03.280 --> 12:10.160
 but it does not tell you whether this positive result is detecting that you have or do not have

12:10.160 --> 12:14.880
 a variant. And unfortunately, we still are doing very limited amounts of sequencing,

12:15.440 --> 12:21.040
 so we don't quite have the robust surveillance that actually is probably important for monoclonals

12:21.040 --> 12:27.040
 when we get there. Okay, active vaccination. I've got a few questions I get hit with,

12:27.040 --> 12:34.000
 so I'm going to put them out here. Can a person get COVID after the vaccine? The answer is yes,

12:34.560 --> 12:40.240
 but it is much less likely. And when they do, they tend to do much better. We actually have

12:40.240 --> 12:47.120
 some pretty robust data really suggesting that the vaccines are impacting not only symptomatic,

12:47.120 --> 12:54.080
 but also asymptomatic and certainly severe or critical disease. If I had COVID, how long should I

12:54.080 --> 13:01.440
 wait to get my vaccine? The CDC and I, on the same page on this, we recommend no minimal interval.

13:01.440 --> 13:05.760
 As soon as you feel well, go get that vaccine. You don't want to go out during the first 10

13:05.760 --> 13:10.000
 days, right? You're in isolation, but as soon as that isolation ends, as soon as you start feeling

13:10.000 --> 13:16.720
 better, get yourself scheduled, get out there. If I get COVID after my first shot,

13:17.840 --> 13:22.000
 should I still get my second shot? And again, this goes back to the same thing.

13:22.000 --> 13:26.640
 As soon as you feel better, you can go ahead and get that second dose, you know, wait your 10

13:26.640 --> 13:31.520
 days of isolation. So you're not going to the vaccine center, getting everyone sick and infected.

13:32.160 --> 13:38.640
 Most of the sites have a manage my appointment feature online. So you can actually go in and

13:38.640 --> 13:43.760
 push that off a little if you're 10 day isolation, if your symptoms mean that there's going to be

13:43.760 --> 13:51.360
 a little bit of a delay here. If I had long COVID or had COVID before, should I get that second shot

13:51.360 --> 13:56.880
 of the two shot vaccines? This can get a little complicated, but I'm going to say we do recommend

13:56.880 --> 14:02.960
 two shots for everyone. And of note, we're hearing more reports. I'm going to cover one here today,

14:02.960 --> 14:10.240
 that improvement in long COVID often doesn't come until after that second shot. Certainly,

14:10.240 --> 14:16.160
 if someone has a anaphylactic or an autoimmune or a concerning reaction, then whether or not you

14:16.160 --> 14:21.200
 get a second shot should be a decision made in consultation with a specialist. But in general,

14:21.200 --> 14:27.520
 the answer is get that second shot. Do vaccines prevent asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection?

14:28.240 --> 14:32.960
 And I'll say here, although we have good data, vaccines prevent symptomatic and severe COVID.

14:34.560 --> 14:38.400
 That's really going to be ending this pandemic is really going to depend a large part

14:38.400 --> 14:46.240
 on the impact on asymptomatic infection and transmission. As we know that about 50% of the

14:46.240 --> 14:52.880
 transmission is probably done by either pre or asymptomatic individuals. So we are getting more

14:52.880 --> 14:58.000
 information suggesting that it prevents asymptomatic infection as well. All right, we have another

14:58.000 --> 15:05.920
 paper here, impact of COVID-19 vaccine on asymptomatic infection among patients undergoing

15:05.920 --> 15:12.000
 pre procedural COVID-19 molecular screening. This was published in CID and goes right at that

15:12.000 --> 15:19.120
 issue. So these are asymptomatic individuals who are being tested as a pre procedural screen.

15:19.840 --> 15:26.800
 So this group conducted a retrospective cohort study of consecutive asymptomatic adult patients

15:26.800 --> 15:34.720
 and N of 39,156. This was done within a large healthcare system here in the United States.

15:34.720 --> 15:42.160
 They underwent over 48,000 pre procedural SARS-CoV-2 molecular screening tests,

15:42.160 --> 15:49.440
 December 17 through February 8, 2021. They compared individuals who had received at least one dose

15:49.440 --> 15:57.040
 of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine versus those that had not. And they looked at the relative risk of a

15:57.040 --> 16:04.000
 positive SARS-CoV-2 molecular test among these asymptomatic persons. And then they adjusted the

16:04.000 --> 16:12.080
 relative risk. They found that compared to unvaccinated individuals, the risk of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2

16:13.120 --> 16:20.480
 detection was lower among those greater than 10 days after the first dose. Their relative risk

16:20.480 --> 16:30.240
 was 0.21. I think this is critical here. This is suggesting an 80, almost an 80% production

16:30.240 --> 16:34.960
 in the risk of an asymptomatic infection, which is interesting. How do we define infection if

16:34.960 --> 16:41.840
 you've got infected, but no symptoms. But also we are seeing, right? As we translate this,

16:41.840 --> 16:48.080
 we have vaccinated millions of individuals, which means an 80% reduction means we are still seeing

16:48.080 --> 16:53.920
 lots of people who are PCR positive after their vaccines. And as I mentioned before,

16:53.920 --> 16:58.960
 the experience we're seeing is they tend to do quite well. And I think the science and experience

16:58.960 --> 17:04.720
 support that. Now, I mentioned briefly on the last twib this observation that we're seeing this. So

17:04.720 --> 17:09.120
 just to sort of give you the real world mixed with what we're seeing in the literature.

17:09.120 --> 17:16.480
 The question of are vaccines safe in patients with long COVID a prospective observational study?

17:17.120 --> 17:22.640
 This was posted as a preprint by group out of the UK. And this is looking at that issue of

17:22.640 --> 17:27.760
 vaccine impact on long COVID. And you can see here, they're really going into this with the

17:27.760 --> 17:30.800
 question of, is it going to be safe? Are they going to be OK? Will there be harm?

17:31.440 --> 17:37.280
 And this group looked at patients that had COVID-19 severe enough to require hospitalization,

17:37.280 --> 17:42.160
 who then went on to develop long COVID. And as I'll talk later, that's a minority.

17:42.160 --> 17:45.120
 Most people with long COVID never were sick enough to end up in the hospital.

17:45.840 --> 17:51.920
 They looked prospectively at 44 vaccinated participants and 22 matched unvaccinated

17:51.920 --> 17:58.240
 participants and assessed them at a medium of 30 median of 32 days post vaccination.

17:59.200 --> 18:05.120
 These were mostly people with severe or highly symptomatic long COVID out about eight months

18:05.120 --> 18:12.880
 after acute infection. And they reported that 23.2% reported an increase in symptom resolution

18:12.880 --> 18:22.240
 versus 15.4% in the unvaccinated with a p-value of 0.035 in just this small sample size. They

18:22.240 --> 18:29.120
 reported no obvious difference in response between mRNA vaccination versus ad no viral vector vaccination.

18:29.840 --> 18:34.560
 So it's nice to actually start to have some science here instead of lots of building anecdotes.

18:35.120 --> 18:38.720
 This is encouraging and does seem in line what we've been hearing from patients,

18:38.720 --> 18:45.680
 a physician or post COVID recovery clinics and support groups, but still a few caveats, right?

18:45.680 --> 18:51.280
 This study only looked at post first dose improvement. So I wouldn't hang my hat on the percent

18:51.280 --> 18:56.240
 reporting improvement. As we're hearing, as I mentioned before, that some do not report

18:56.240 --> 19:01.280
 improvement until after their second dose or farther out with the one dose J and J vaccine.

19:01.280 --> 19:06.400
 This is also a small sample size with really short follow up. So we do not know much about

19:06.400 --> 19:13.120
 the long term as far as the durability of this reported improvement. But this study does support

19:13.120 --> 19:19.200
 the safety of vaccination for people even with severe long COVID. And there is here this

19:19.200 --> 19:25.440
 suggestion of possible benefit AstraZeneca vaccine, the white elephant in the vaccine room.

19:26.160 --> 19:31.920
 We got a press release reporting the results of the AstraZeneca U.S. Phase III trial demonstrating

19:31.920 --> 19:39.520
 statistically significant vaccine efficacy of 79% at preventing symptomatic COVID-19 and 100%

19:39.520 --> 19:44.880
 efficacy at preventing severe disease and hospitalization. A lot of people got really excited.

19:45.520 --> 19:53.040
 Anthony Fauci said this is fantastic, but maybe not. I liken this to someone's getting measured

19:53.040 --> 19:59.920
 and you notice they're standing on their tippy toes. It may be 76% at preventing symptomatic.

19:59.920 --> 20:05.600
 But we heard I think some disturbing news that maybe they had cherry picked. Maybe they had not

20:05.600 --> 20:12.160
 presented the most up to date data. It's a little disturbing because the thing we really care about

20:12.160 --> 20:18.000
 is this vaccine that keeps people from dying from ending up in the hospital. That data has

20:18.000 --> 20:23.280
 continued to be very clear. This other sort of competitive number, you know, what's the number

20:23.280 --> 20:31.360
 for mild disease, whether it's 76, whether it's 79, would have been better if this data had been

20:31.360 --> 20:38.880
 presented better. It's unfortunate here because this is really a great vaccine from a physician

20:38.880 --> 20:45.040
 standpoint. This is easy to use. It can be stored, transported, handled at normal refrigeration

20:45.040 --> 20:50.560
 conditions for out to about six months. It doesn't need any kind of preparation before you administer.

20:50.560 --> 20:57.360
 So it's a much easier vaccine for us. But as we heard, the data safety monitoring board notified

20:57.360 --> 21:03.360
 everyone that this data was not quite the data that we wanted it to be. So I will return to

21:03.360 --> 21:09.920
 the AstraZeneca vaccine when all the information is available for the FDA review and we have a

21:09.920 --> 21:15.040
 chance to go through the data. So just want to sort of remind everyone here, we're not just

21:15.040 --> 21:20.640
 oh, call it a vaccine and we're pro, we're going to be honest. And when something like this happens,

21:20.640 --> 21:27.520
 we're going to share that as I'm doing here now. Passive vaccination. This is the monoclonal antibodies,

21:27.520 --> 21:33.280
 really good uptake of the monoclonal antiviral cocktails. And we continue to see excellent results.

21:33.920 --> 21:40.160
 This is now part of the IDSA guidelines. But what exactly did the guidelines say? They advocate

21:40.160 --> 21:46.160
 for the use of BAM linibimab and the test of a map together in outpatients with mild to moderate

21:46.160 --> 21:53.440
 disease who are at high risk for progression to severe disease and say that CASA ribimab,

21:53.440 --> 22:01.280
 MDivimab, may have a similar clinical benefit, but the data are currently limited. Well, I have

22:01.280 --> 22:07.280
 to say in the days of COVID, the concept of living guidelines is presented with lots of challenges

22:07.280 --> 22:12.880
 as we live in a day of the days of the fire hose of information. And this week, Tuesday,

22:12.880 --> 22:18.400
 March 23rd, Regeneron released the data from their phase three trial as promised. So I feel like

22:18.400 --> 22:24.480
 these guidelines need to be rapidly updated. These results from Regeneron were from a phase

22:24.480 --> 22:30.160
 three randomized control trial looking at treatment in infected non-hospitalized patients,

22:30.160 --> 22:39.840
 4,567 in this trial. They met the primary endpoint of showing that the Regeneron COV,

22:39.840 --> 22:46.160
 so this is the Regeneron cocktail with the CASA ribimab and MDivimab significantly reduced the

22:46.160 --> 22:53.360
 risk of hospitalization or death by 70% with the low dose, 71% with the higher dose compared to

22:53.360 --> 23:03.840
 placebo. And the p-values for high and low dose were either 0.0024 or less than 0.001.

23:03.840 --> 23:10.720
 No safety issues were observed. So I think the data is becoming really, really compelling for

23:10.720 --> 23:17.040
 the impact of this approach, the monoclonal cocktail approach. What was really interesting,

23:17.040 --> 23:21.680
 I have to say in this press release and looking forward to the published data is they actually

23:21.680 --> 23:28.800
 provided a table of neutralization data looking at several variants from different regions of

23:28.800 --> 23:35.520
 the world. They tested key substitutions and actually showed that this therapy based on this

23:35.520 --> 23:42.480
 data would continue to be effective. So we've moved to cocktails, I think as I mentioned across the

23:43.280 --> 23:49.200
 across the country. So vaccine shots and monoclonal cocktails for everyone. The early

23:49.200 --> 23:53.760
 inflammatory phase, we have a little bit of information here. There was a paper aspirin use

23:53.760 --> 23:58.000
 is associated with decreased mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit admission,

23:58.000 --> 24:04.640
 and in hospital mortality in hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 was published in

24:04.640 --> 24:12.000
 the journal of anesthesia and analgesia. This was a retrospective observational cohort study,

24:12.000 --> 24:16.880
 right? So we got to put that in that context. They looked at COVID-19 patients admitted to

24:16.880 --> 24:23.440
 multiple hospitals in the United States between March and July of 2020. And the authors looked

24:23.440 --> 24:28.320
 back through the medical records, basically identifying who was on aspirin, who wasn't on

24:28.320 --> 24:33.200
 aspirin, and then they tried to adjust. But I want to point out this was not a randomized,

24:33.200 --> 24:41.760
 blinded prospective trial. They ultimately looked at 412 patients, 314, about 76% not getting

24:41.760 --> 24:47.760
 aspirin, 98 patients who are about 24% did get aspirin. And they reported seeing that patients

24:47.760 --> 24:52.960
 getting aspirin were less likely to end up needing to be transferred to the ICU, less likely to

24:52.960 --> 24:58.480
 end up needing mechanical ventilation, and less likely to die well in the hospital. And they did

24:58.480 --> 25:04.560
 not report any significant increase in bleeding complications. So just to put this in context,

25:04.560 --> 25:09.280
 this is not a prospective randomized control trial, but sort of interesting attention on the

25:09.280 --> 25:14.800
 possible role of aspirin. And here again, in this section, the early inflammatory phase,

25:14.800 --> 25:21.120
 the IDSA has updated its guidelines and is now recommending that tosyllism apps should be

25:21.120 --> 25:27.920
 used in hospitalized patients who are sick enough to have progressed severe or critical COVID-19.

25:27.920 --> 25:34.000
 But a note is that this is an add-on to steroid therapy. All right, we actually have a bunch

25:34.000 --> 25:42.640
 today on the long COVID, the post-acute sequelae COVID-19. So there was a really nice review,

25:43.200 --> 25:50.400
 post-acute COVID-19 syndrome that was published in Nature Medicine. And there really was so much

25:50.400 --> 25:55.600
 here that I'm going to actually say people should sit down, read this once, twice, three times.

25:56.240 --> 26:03.200
 They have a really nice box summary of the post-acute COVID-19 issues by Oregon system.

26:03.200 --> 26:09.520
 So they go through all the pulmonary issues, hematological, cardiovascular, neuropsychiatric,

26:10.240 --> 26:17.760
 renal, endocrine, GI dermatologic, and then even have a little section on the Miss C.

26:18.560 --> 26:24.000
 So this is excellent. And I think as we're working with these patients in our long COVID,

26:24.000 --> 26:30.400
 our post-acute COVID recovery centers, this is actually a helpful paper for realizing that

26:30.400 --> 26:36.240
 it actually takes a team to help these individuals. The neurologist might jump in with a lot of the

26:36.240 --> 26:43.280
 severe headaches, which seem vascular, migraine type. Pulmonary is critical, cardiology.

26:44.000 --> 26:51.280
 There's a lot of complexity here. We also saw COVID-19 survivors reports of the timing,

26:51.280 --> 26:58.480
 duration, and health impacts of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2, P-A-S-C infection was

26:58.480 --> 27:04.400
 posted as a preprint. Now, this was a very interesting paper in that the participants in the study

27:04.400 --> 27:12.560
 are members of long COVID support groups. And I think this represents an exciting development

27:12.560 --> 27:18.480
 whereby citizen scientists are working together with data and other scientists to try to understand

27:18.480 --> 27:23.920
 the challenges, the needs and characteristics of these people suffering from long COVID or

27:23.920 --> 27:30.160
 what's now termed post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2. I mean, very interesting and consistent with my

27:30.160 --> 27:37.200
 experience are the described stages or waves of this post-acute COVID experience. With this early

27:37.200 --> 27:42.800
 wave with neurological and cardiovascular manifestations, then a second wave with skin

27:42.800 --> 27:48.800
 manifestations such as COVID toes, hair loss, and then this final wave of symptoms during which the

27:48.800 --> 27:55.200
 fatigue just continues to be ongoing. So, I think that this is sort of, I think, nice for

27:55.200 --> 28:00.400
 clinicians who are taking care of these patients to see how the patients are describing this

28:00.400 --> 28:05.760
 experience. I think it helps for the patients as well to speak to a clinician that has had the

28:05.760 --> 28:09.600
 ability to sort of understand this. There's a lot of validation for the patients here

28:10.240 --> 28:15.280
 when you can sort of be almost anticipating where they are in this process and what the

28:15.280 --> 28:20.720
 challenges might be at that time. I mean, there certainly are limitations here. I mean,

28:20.720 --> 28:26.480
 one is that this was predominantly white women since the participants come from online support

28:26.480 --> 28:32.080
 groups. There's a certain amount of selection, so this isn't a random sample. But one of the things

28:32.080 --> 28:36.800
 I was going to say, I've heard several times where clinicians look at people with long COVID and

28:36.800 --> 28:41.920
 they say, you know what, these people are doing much better than the average ICU survivor. If I

28:41.920 --> 28:46.800
 was in the ICU and survived, I'd rather have long COVID than something else. And what I like to point

28:46.800 --> 28:53.200
 out here, and this was very clear from the paper, is that 84% of these people who are doing so well

28:53.200 --> 28:58.720
 compared to someone who spent a month in the ICU never were even hospitalized. A lot of these

28:58.720 --> 29:04.800
 individuals started off with a mild or even asymptomatic acute COVID. And here they are

29:05.600 --> 29:11.440
 many, many months later looking a little bit better than someone who was in the ICU for sepsis or

29:11.440 --> 29:17.840
 something else. Also another paper, persistent neurological symptoms and cognitive dysfunction

29:17.840 --> 29:24.080
 in non-hospitalized COVID-19 long haulers. This was published in the Annals of Clinical and

29:24.080 --> 29:30.880
 Translational Neurology. So they reported other results from this was a prospective study of 100

29:30.880 --> 29:38.240
 consecutive patients, SARS-CoV-2 laboratory positive, and then they had a 50 laboratory

29:38.240 --> 29:44.000
 negative control group. And these individuals presented to a neuro COVID-19 clinic.

29:44.720 --> 29:50.720
 So due to early pandemic testing limitations, patients were included. If they were never

29:50.720 --> 29:57.200
 hospitalized for pneumonia or hypoxemia and had neurological symptoms lasting over six weeks.

29:57.760 --> 30:03.680
 So this is sort of a snapshot of those people who never ended up in the hospital but had a

30:03.680 --> 30:08.320
 neurological issue that required attention. And they reported that the main neurological

30:08.320 --> 30:13.760
 manifestations were, I think this will sound familiar to people, brain fog was reported

30:13.760 --> 30:21.760
 81% that feeling that you just can't think clearly. 68% were reporting headaches. And as I've mentioned

30:21.760 --> 30:27.680
 a lot of these headaches actually seem like the intractable vascular migraine severe headaches.

30:27.680 --> 30:38.240
 Numbness tingling, 60%. Disguysia, 59%. And nausea, 55%. Myalgia, 55%. And the overwhelming,

30:38.240 --> 30:44.560
 85% had this ongoing fatigue. And they exhibited impaired quality of life in cognitive and

30:44.560 --> 30:50.480
 fatigue domains. And the patient performed worse attention and working memory cognitive tests

30:50.480 --> 30:56.640
 compared to that control population and a demographically matched US population. So

30:56.640 --> 31:01.680
 I think this points out what's really upsetting to a lot of us just how many of these patients

31:01.680 --> 31:07.280
 are continuing to suffer. So let me close on there, leave a little time for emails. But just

31:07.280 --> 31:11.040
 ask everyone for their continued support. And thank you so much for all the support we're

31:11.040 --> 31:16.720
 continuing to get. We are going to continue to support the American Society for Tropical Medicine

31:17.280 --> 31:23.840
 and Hygiene. And we're going to, it looks like we're going to succeed in being able to donate

31:23.840 --> 31:31.680
 enough money for three travel awards, bringing early career women from low income parts of the

31:31.680 --> 31:38.560
 world to come to the fall annual American Society for Tropical Medicine meeting. So thank you for

31:38.560 --> 31:44.400
 continuing to support our work. Okay, it's time for some email. You can send yours to danielatmicrobe.tv.

31:44.400 --> 31:49.680
 The first is from John Mascola, who is the director of the Vaccine Research Center at NIH.

31:49.680 --> 31:56.640
 John writes, I love Twiv. I listen every week. And as an ID doc that does mostly research,

31:56.640 --> 32:01.520
 I also appreciate the COVID clinical updates. So glad to help out Dr. Dan Griffin regarding

32:01.520 --> 32:06.960
 one question that is in my wheelhouse where he did not know the answer immunogenicity

32:06.960 --> 32:11.920
 of COVID vaccines and older subjects. There are published data showing mRNA is similarly

32:11.920 --> 32:18.320
 immunogenic across age groups. So good news. And John provides a link for that. It'll be in

32:18.320 --> 32:25.280
 the show notes. Thank you, John. I think this is great. I mean, this just sort of reinforces that

32:25.280 --> 32:30.240
 this is not actually just a one man show. I mean, I get a lot of support from my colleagues.

32:30.240 --> 32:34.000
 And I love this. I love getting emails. And you know, you can send them either directly to me

32:34.000 --> 32:39.200
 or this is even better. Send them to, you know, Daniel at Microbe TV. And yeah, this is this

32:39.200 --> 32:43.840
 is great. There's a lot of information. And thank you so much, John, for for sending this in.

32:43.840 --> 32:48.320
 Yeah, if you send them to Daniel at Microbe TV, then many more people will get the answer rather

32:48.320 --> 32:54.960
 than just you. That's better. Yeah, that makes my life easier. Send them to Daniel at microbe.tv.

32:54.960 --> 32:59.360
 So Paul in the University of Manchester in the UK wants to know if you can comment on the

32:59.360 --> 33:05.760
 AstraZeneca vaccine, specifically the clotting issues and wonders if he should be taking aspirin

33:05.760 --> 33:10.320
 around the time of vaccination. Yeah, I mean, so I actually appreciate the fact that you wrote this

33:10.320 --> 33:16.960
 and if you look at the data here, right, it looks like the incidence what 30 and about that many

33:16.960 --> 33:22.160
 million people vaccinated, you know, one in a million, which is actually not higher than we see

33:22.160 --> 33:28.000
 as a background in the population, almost seems lower to be honest. So I think that we've sort

33:28.000 --> 33:32.880
 of come down with not thinking that there's any kind of clotting complication associated with

33:32.880 --> 33:38.800
 the vaccine. But I don't think the AstraZeneca has done such a great job of instilling confidence.

33:38.800 --> 33:43.600
 So I will weigh in and say, I do not think this is an issue. I'm not going to recommend taking

33:43.600 --> 33:47.920
 aspirin around the vaccine. I actually think this vaccine is effective. I think it's safe,

33:47.920 --> 33:52.960
 but it just maybe wasn't quite as effective with a few percentage points off of what they were

33:52.960 --> 33:59.520
 trying to suggest. Anne is treating a patient, a 77 year old patient got her first vaccine on

34:00.320 --> 34:08.080
 March 6th, and then 38 was found unresponsive and finally had a diagnosis of encephalopathy with

34:08.080 --> 34:15.600
 possible seizure. So Anne wants to know what to do. The family is quite apprehensive about the

34:15.600 --> 34:20.960
 patient receiving the second vaccination never has allergic reactions. Only medical intolerance

34:20.960 --> 34:25.440
 is myalgia on statin therapy. I'm inclined to have the patient receive the second vaccination,

34:25.440 --> 34:30.960
 but wondered if you had a different response. So this is a tough one, I have to say. This

34:30.960 --> 34:36.400
 falls into this category where, you know, I think this is going to have to be an individual decision

34:36.400 --> 34:42.000
 where you look at the situation and you're going to have to try to parse out. Do you think this

34:42.000 --> 34:47.840
 encephalitis was a vaccine reaction? You know, we certainly, I think I related the story of this.

34:47.840 --> 34:55.680
 I had a gentleman who developed an autoimmune reaction. Really, it was a really a multi-inflammatory

34:55.680 --> 35:03.120
 type syndrome with his natural COVID infection. And he had issues with his vision to plopia.

35:03.120 --> 35:07.440
 And then when he got his vaccine, he actually seemed to have recurrence and responded very

35:07.440 --> 35:14.960
 quickly to steroids and IVIG. So, you know, we talk about these are agents that have efficacy,

35:14.960 --> 35:20.160
 that have effects on the human body. So I think that this is not going to be a very easy decision.

35:20.160 --> 35:25.600
 So Anne, I'm glad you're making it and not me. But yeah, you're going to, I think you probably

35:25.600 --> 35:31.680
 want to reach out to your local ID, your local allergy immunology. Really, make sure that we're

35:31.680 --> 35:35.440
 giving the best advice here. So this is complicated. All right.

35:35.440 --> 35:40.880
 Last one is from Anthony from Brown University Medical School, who's a family physician,

35:40.880 --> 35:45.360
 encountered a scenario this week, confused about despite the benefit of your teaching.

35:45.360 --> 35:49.520
 I was involved in the care of an elderly woman who lives in the community, but his homebound

35:49.520 --> 35:54.480
 has home health aides. Unfortunately, one of her aides tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 last week.

35:54.480 --> 35:59.600
 On the day that this patient received her second mRNA vaccine, four days later, the patient

35:59.600 --> 36:05.760
 has now tested positive, but is asymptomatic. She clearly meets criteria for eligibility for

36:05.760 --> 36:11.680
 monoclonal antibody based on her age. The conundrum is she's also probably derived some protection

36:11.680 --> 36:17.120
 from developing COVID from her nearly completed vaccine series. And there would be a theoretical

36:17.120 --> 36:20.800
 concern about the passive immunization provided by monoclonal therapy,

36:20.800 --> 36:25.920
 blunting her own immune response. We decided to get her treated, prioritizing short-term gains

36:25.920 --> 36:31.520
 in a patient at risk. What would you say? So I would treat in this case. And let me just run

36:31.520 --> 36:38.400
 through sort of my rule and the thinking. So if someone meets criteria, as we've shared the data,

36:38.400 --> 36:45.440
 these are really impressive tools, the monoclonal cocktails. So you take an individual, and you

36:45.440 --> 36:50.880
 look at this individually, say, OK, this is a person who is high risk for ending up in the hospital.

36:50.880 --> 36:58.880
 If they end up in the hospital, we know that people often don't do very well. The monoclonals are

36:58.880 --> 37:03.280
 really going to reduce that chance of progression. And I actually expect someone who's already had

37:03.280 --> 37:07.600
 the benefit of the vaccination, the benefit of already starting up to have some sort of a T-cell

37:07.600 --> 37:11.680
 response is going to do even better. That's actually I have to say what our experience has been.

37:12.480 --> 37:17.040
 What is really the downside? I'm going to sort of ask that question. So you give the person the

37:17.040 --> 37:23.040
 monoclonals. OK, maybe that second dose of vaccine doesn't work so well. In three months,

37:23.600 --> 37:28.960
 you can probably go ahead and give that second dose again, basically say, OK, I sort of interfered

37:28.960 --> 37:33.760
 with its ability to have efficacy. And for that three months while you're waiting,

37:33.760 --> 37:39.360
 the person has these monoclonal antibodies at a very high level. They're protected. They're

37:39.360 --> 37:44.640
 passively immunized. So basically what you're doing here is you're instantly having this person

37:44.640 --> 37:49.680
 immunized by sending them for monoclonals rather than waiting for whatever days for the staff.

37:49.680 --> 37:56.640
 And so I do not. We don't in any of our programs use prior vaccination as an exclusion criteria.

37:56.640 --> 38:02.560
 If the person ends up getting infected, it's either because it wasn't enough time for them to get

38:02.560 --> 38:08.640
 protection. But as we point out, we might do a study of 40,000 people or 20,000 get it. No one

38:08.640 --> 38:12.800
 ends up in the hospital. But you translate that into the real world where you're starting to give

38:12.800 --> 38:17.440
 this to older individuals. Maybe they have medical problems. Maybe they have an issue

38:17.440 --> 38:23.280
 bouncing that protective response. They end up infected with the virus. I would advise jumping

38:23.280 --> 38:30.240
 in with these really highly effective therapies. That's COVID-19 clinical update number 55 with

38:30.240 --> 38:43.600
 Dr. Daniel Griffin. Thank you, Daniel. Oh, thank you so much. And everyone be safe.
