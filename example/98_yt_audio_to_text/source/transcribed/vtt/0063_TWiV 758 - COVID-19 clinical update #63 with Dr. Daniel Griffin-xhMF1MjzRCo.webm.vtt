 This week in virology, the podcast about viruses, the kind that make you sick.

00:10.400 --> 00:22.880
 From Microbe TV, this is Twiv, this week in virology, episode 758 recorded on May 20, 2021.

00:22.880 --> 00:28.320
 I'm Vincent Rack in yellow, and you are listening to the podcast all about viruses.

00:28.320 --> 00:31.600
 Joining me today from New York, Daniel Griffin.

00:32.800 --> 00:41.040
 Hello, everyone. Daniel, this is clinical update number 63. How will we know when the pandemic's

00:41.040 --> 00:49.360
 over, Daniel? That's a great question. When will it shift from being a pandemic to just,

00:49.360 --> 00:54.720
 hey, there's still COVID-19 around and it's become less of a pandemic?

00:54.720 --> 00:59.360
 And maybe, Vincent, maybe you're the person to answer that question, because what was the point

00:59.360 --> 01:05.120
 when polio ceased to be a pandemic and started to be just something we were trying to get rid of?

01:06.080 --> 01:12.640
 Now, polio was around before we had this word pandemic, so we never got the call in a pandemic.

01:12.640 --> 01:16.960
 But Daniel, would you say we're still in the middle of an HIV AIDS pandemic?

01:18.160 --> 01:23.280
 Yeah, and I try to make that point. I've been offered a couple of people have reached out and

01:23.280 --> 01:29.520
 said, oh, would you like to write a book? And I am working on a book that Chuck Knersch connected

01:29.520 --> 01:36.320
 me with about sort of what happened with the vaccines and what was the rollout like.

01:36.320 --> 01:40.960
 But the whole idea about writing a book about, oh, we've survived the pandemic or I have no other

01:40.960 --> 01:46.080
 people have written these books. And it reminded me of a movie, and it was surviving the pandemic,

01:46.080 --> 01:52.480
 and it was about HIV. And I remember talking to my buddy, Joe McGowan, I was like, I don't understand.

01:52.480 --> 02:00.800
 It's not over. There are over 30 million people infected with HIV. We see another 50,000 new

02:00.800 --> 02:05.520
 infections every year in the US. We see, you know, half a million to a million people every year

02:05.520 --> 02:10.240
 dying of HIV. Explain to me how we're not still in the midst of that pandemic.

02:10.240 --> 02:15.600
 That's right. So yeah, Daniel, before you start, what's on your bow tie today?

02:16.480 --> 02:21.040
 You know, it kind of looks like a coronavirus, doesn't it? Yeah, it's very nice with the

02:21.040 --> 02:28.400
 little coronas there. So all right. Yeah, our listeners may not know this, but it was about

02:28.400 --> 02:34.400
 every one of my bow ties is an infectious disease. And whenever I appear on Friday, it's always a

02:34.400 --> 02:41.120
 sexually transmitted infectious disease. And when you take care of patients, do you wear these

02:41.120 --> 02:49.760
 infectious bow ties? I do, I do. Very good. And I started doing it in part as a teaching thing

02:49.760 --> 02:55.840
 for the residents and medical students. So that was always, I actually, my socks match. I won't

02:55.840 --> 03:00.720
 show those now, but they match the pathogen. So maybe I'm wearing like one with little red

03:00.720 --> 03:05.280
 snappers. So there's supposed to cue them that it's tuberculosis. I have an anthrax. I have

03:05.920 --> 03:07.520
 several others. Great. Love it.

03:09.200 --> 03:16.160
 All right, let's jump right in with my quotation. We are drowning in information,

03:16.160 --> 03:22.880
 but starved for knowledge. And that's by John Nasebitt. And I think this is so relevant,

03:22.880 --> 03:28.800
 because it's really this fire hose of information. We're seeing it all around COVID, but this is

03:28.800 --> 03:34.000
 just the modern world. And we're always struggling to make sense of what does all this information

03:34.560 --> 03:40.800
 mean? How do we actually get from information to knowledge? So hopefully we play a part in doing

03:40.800 --> 03:47.520
 that. Let me start with the updates. How are things? Things are really much better here in the US

03:48.480 --> 03:54.640
 here in New York. One of our local hospitals I discharged to I think is at least for the moment,

03:54.640 --> 03:59.680
 this will be no COVID patients left in the hospital after this gentleman goes home. He's

03:59.680 --> 04:06.160
 probably home already with his wife and twins. So that's very exciting. Other big hospitals

04:06.160 --> 04:12.240
 in our area down to single digit numbers of COVID cases. My partner, New Julie, just admitted

04:12.240 --> 04:17.840
 someone today with COVID. And as you can imagine, this is a woman who did not get her vaccine,

04:17.840 --> 04:23.920
 you know, diabetic who really should have been taking that opportunity. So that's what we're

04:23.920 --> 04:29.120
 seeing now. We're seeing younger individuals. We're seeing people who did not take the opportunity

04:29.120 --> 04:34.800
 to get vaccinated. But the numbers really, you know, exponentially seem to be going down.

04:34.800 --> 04:39.520
 I continue to have that optimism that we're going to be in a really great place across the

04:39.520 --> 04:44.400
 country in July. There certainly are areas with poor vaccine uptake. And you know, you worry about

04:44.400 --> 04:49.360
 those areas starting to see a rise when people get back indoors either because it got so gosh darn

04:49.360 --> 04:55.360
 hot, they're in for air conditioning or when it gets cold again and people are indoors for the warmth.

04:56.640 --> 05:01.840
 Around the world, right? I'm sort of parallel with the HIV. We are in no way at the end of this

05:01.840 --> 05:08.240
 pandemic. And until we are more generous until we're able to get everyone in the world vaccinated,

05:08.240 --> 05:13.760
 we are not safe joking today about first world problems where people complain about their chairs

05:13.760 --> 05:17.600
 not as comfortable as they would like. There's plenty of places in the world without chairs,

05:17.600 --> 05:25.520
 right? And I think that's the vaccine story at this point. I will say as we get into this,

05:25.520 --> 05:32.640
 we certainly have evolving recommendations, have people's heads a little bit spinning. But that's

05:32.640 --> 05:38.400
 actually what we wanted. We wanted to learn. We are not where we were a year ago. A year ago,

05:38.400 --> 05:43.600
 we did not know much. We actually know a tremendous amount now. And as we learn more,

05:43.600 --> 05:50.160
 as the science comes in, then we can actually revise what people are being told to do.

05:50.880 --> 05:55.280
 What we know is safe. What we know is not safe. So we'll go through that. But I'm going to

05:55.280 --> 06:01.200
 start with my children and COVID. This is always the crowd pleaser or not.

06:02.320 --> 06:08.400
 Paul Offit appeared on the podcast Track the Vax with Serena Marshall. That's another one of

06:08.400 --> 06:15.120
 the podcasts that I enjoy listening to. I actually was on, I was a guest on the 13th episode of Track

06:15.120 --> 06:22.000
 the Vax. And Serena is wonderful. I miss that it wasn't as raw, I think as Twiv is, because at one

06:22.000 --> 06:26.320
 point, she asked me a question. And I replied, and she just started laughing to the point where

06:26.320 --> 06:30.080
 she had to actually stop the recording. And she edited that out. I thought that was great. But

06:30.960 --> 06:39.600
 not all my jokes are bad. So this episode with Paul Offit was the May 18th episode. I'm giving

06:39.600 --> 06:49.760
 a little plug for them called Next Up in Line for COVID Vaccines Kids. And it was really a great,

06:49.760 --> 06:56.160
 great discussion between Serena and Paul. And Paul Offit brought up the fact really that I

06:56.160 --> 07:02.640
 try to reinforce on a regular basis that yes, kids are actually at some risk. It's not huge,

07:02.640 --> 07:08.480
 it certainly is lower. But the reason we're recommending vaccination to adolescents at this

07:08.480 --> 07:14.480
 point is not for the greater good. It's actually to protect them. It's like putting a seatbelt on

07:14.480 --> 07:20.480
 them, putting a helmet on them. And let me quote Paul Offit what he said during that discussion.

07:21.200 --> 07:27.040
 You have at least 300 children who've died from this infection and estimates are it could be as

07:27.040 --> 07:32.800
 high as 500. He's talking about just right here in the United States. He also pointed out that we

07:32.800 --> 07:38.080
 did a really great job. I like to reinforce this initially of protecting our children early in

07:38.080 --> 07:45.040
 the pandemic with only 2.4% of those total infections in the early months being in children.

07:46.000 --> 07:52.640
 Now things are changing. Now children account for 24% of the infections. My colleagues, as I

07:52.640 --> 08:00.400
 mentioned, are admitting adolescents to ICUs, number of articles and releases about the shift

08:00.400 --> 08:07.120
 into younger ages. I'm also going to add here that per CDC, the number of confirmed multi-system

08:07.120 --> 08:13.680
 inflammatory syndrome cases in children. So that's that Miss C is approaching 4,000.

08:13.680 --> 08:18.720
 And there are many more that are still under investigation, including about 500 just right

08:18.720 --> 08:23.520
 here in New York State. I don't want to blow that out of proportion because I like to say

08:23.520 --> 08:29.680
 children are at low risk. They're not at no risk. But there are things we can do to keep these kids

08:29.680 --> 08:35.840
 safe. It has been really difficult for a lot of these children. Actually, I will say for us parents

08:35.840 --> 08:40.400
 to have schools closed, to have a lot of these other social and other opportunities closed. But

08:40.400 --> 08:47.040
 there was another MMWR publication hot off the press today as we're recording this. Characteristics

08:47.040 --> 08:53.680
 of COVID-19 cases and outbreaks at childcare facilities, District of Columbia, July through

08:53.680 --> 09:01.520
 December 2020. And here the authors were reporting on 469 childcare facilities in the District of

09:01.520 --> 09:09.760
 Columbia. As far as facility associated outbreaks, they occurred in 5.8% of the facilities. The other

09:09.760 --> 09:17.600
 flip of that is you could say over 94% of the facilities had no outbreaks. The childcare facilities

09:17.600 --> 09:23.040
 in D.C. were able to adhere to many of the recommended prevention measures and reporting

09:23.040 --> 09:29.040
 requirements. And basically they did a good job. The kids were able to be in these settings and

09:29.040 --> 09:33.760
 they reported that really similar to what had been observed in other studies. The rise in the

09:33.760 --> 09:40.880
 COVID-19 cases and outbreaks correlated with level of community spread. So I think that's

09:40.880 --> 09:46.240
 really a positive message here. We can get these kids out in these settings. We can do it safely.

09:46.240 --> 09:53.360
 We've learned how to do that. We now have the lowest positive test rates across this country,

09:53.360 --> 09:58.240
 actually ever. Early on when we started testing, I remember New York, like 80% of the tests were

09:58.240 --> 10:04.080
 coming back positive. In a recent article that I tweeted out, I should tell people just follow my

10:04.640 --> 10:10.480
 Twitter at Daniel Griffin MD because I try to get a lot of these articles out there. But really

10:10.480 --> 10:16.080
 showing how a lack of testing plagued us early on. Now we are doing a lot of testing and you know

10:16.080 --> 10:20.400
 you're doing enough testing or you're doing a lot of testing when you're getting a positivity rate

10:20.400 --> 10:27.760
 of down in the 1% or 2% nationally. So really going in the right direction here for improving

10:27.760 --> 10:32.560
 the risk for our children. I should probably tell this story here. I always try to be careful

10:32.560 --> 10:37.280
 when I talk about risk and I talk about no risk. My wife asked me yesterday, she was going to give

10:37.280 --> 10:43.760
 Barnaby a sandwich with a Swiss cheese, turkey and mayo and it had been an insulated thing and

10:43.760 --> 10:48.080
 there was a blue iced thing in there. But now the blue iced thing was no longer cold. So she

10:48.080 --> 10:53.760
 wasn't enough. It was still okay for Barnaby to put in a new blue ice pack. And I had not

10:53.760 --> 10:59.280
 taken off my work hat. So I said, oh, that seems like a very low risk decision going ahead and

10:59.280 --> 11:02.960
 letting you have that. My wife's response was, I don't want a low risk. I want no risk for our

11:02.960 --> 11:10.880
 son Barnaby. I was like, no, it's fine. We can eat that's how it will be fine. So I know we want

11:10.880 --> 11:16.480
 absolutes. But even when it comes to sandwiches, we don't have absolutes. All right, pre exposure

11:16.480 --> 11:24.160
 transmission. On Friday, May 14th, the article interim estimates of vaccine effectiveness of Pfizer,

11:24.160 --> 11:31.360
 BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines among healthcare personnel, 33 US sites January through

11:31.360 --> 11:36.960
 March 2021. Right. So this is this is hot off the press. This became available as an early release.

11:37.520 --> 11:42.800
 And on the last tweet of clinical update, Vincent had asked mainly to address questions from our

11:42.800 --> 11:48.160
 audience about how we knew about safety and efficacy of vaccines beyond the initial large

11:48.160 --> 11:53.680
 RCTs, right? We were talking about the latest adolescent trials, only 2,000 people in there. But

11:53.680 --> 11:59.920
 what are they doing over time? So I brought up theirs. But here, this is one of these

12:01.600 --> 12:07.760
 trials that continues to give us information after those RCTs. So here the authors report on a

12:07.760 --> 12:16.800
 case control study of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine efficacy, V E with HCP healthcare personnel,

12:16.800 --> 12:23.040
 being enrolled at these 33 sites across the United States. So these were healthcare personnel

12:23.040 --> 12:30.080
 with the potential for exposure to SARS-CoV-2 through direct patient contact or for, you know,

12:30.080 --> 12:35.840
 indirect exposure. So think about these are these are people who are exposed, right? So you're

12:35.840 --> 12:40.960
 getting an exposure here. They had they had case patients, they had control participants.

12:41.600 --> 12:47.040
 And these were being identified through routine employee testing performed onsite

12:47.600 --> 12:52.720
 through their occupational health practices. They went ahead and the healthcare personnel with a

12:52.720 --> 13:00.320
 positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR or antigen based test result. And at least one COVID-19 like illness

13:00.320 --> 13:07.520
 were enrolled as the cases. And then we had the negatives being those who did not have a PCR.

13:08.160 --> 13:11.360
 You know, it didn't matter if these people had symptoms, right? If they had something else going

13:11.360 --> 13:21.680
 on as long as they did not have COVID. And as of March 18, 2021, 623 case patients, 1,220 controls

13:21.680 --> 13:30.160
 were enrolled. And they gave us an effectiveness estimate of a complete 2 dose regimen of these

13:30.160 --> 13:38.080
 vaccines at 94%, which is really actually consistent with the clinical trials. And I should say

13:38.080 --> 13:42.880
 surprising, right? We were not expecting, you know, the real world is usually not as good as what we

13:42.880 --> 13:50.400
 see. But what are the limitations here? So first, testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare

13:50.400 --> 13:55.920
 providers was based on occupational health practices at each facility. And, you know,

13:55.920 --> 14:00.880
 vaccinated people may have actually been less likely to go for testing, possibly underestimating

14:00.880 --> 14:04.720
 the efficacy. They, you know, thinking, hey, I've been vaccinated, I'm not as worried about a

14:04.720 --> 14:09.680
 little bit of sniffles here. So that is one issue. And the authors comment on this as well.

14:10.480 --> 14:15.680
 Second, again, limited sample size. You know, we love our tens, our 20s, our 30,000. So this

14:15.680 --> 14:22.880
 was not as big as sample size. And third, right? It's not clear that you can generalize this to

14:22.880 --> 14:30.080
 the entire US population, right? So different races, different ethnic groups age, right? We've

14:30.080 --> 14:35.440
 certainly started to get a sense that the vaccine has different efficacy based upon age, good data

14:35.440 --> 14:42.080
 starting to support that. And fourth, the healthcare personnel with a known past SARS-CoV-2 infection

14:42.080 --> 14:46.000
 were excluded, right? We're vaccinating those individuals, giving them protection.

14:46.640 --> 14:51.840
 So again, are those people going to get better or worse protection than people who did not have

14:51.840 --> 14:57.360
 that exposure prior to vaccination? We think that they may actually be even more protected. So

14:57.360 --> 15:04.000
 that 94%, another reason why maybe even underestimation. So now this was actually the data that came out

15:04.000 --> 15:09.360
 the day after our last Twiv and the headline, making comments by the current CDC director about

15:09.360 --> 15:14.560
 vaccines and masking. So I certainly have gotten a lot of questions. So I'm going to spend a little

15:14.560 --> 15:20.800
 bit of time discussing that sort of in this context. So what was that all about? So I think

15:20.800 --> 15:26.800
 there were several points that was based on. And I think the CDC director has been really clear

15:26.800 --> 15:32.400
 that the recommendations were science driven. And what is that science? Well, one of the bits of

15:32.400 --> 15:39.040
 science that has just been building, and this was another brick in that wall, is that vaccines

15:39.040 --> 15:46.160
 can be incredibly powerful at protecting a vaccinated person, right? So the person vaccinated,

15:46.160 --> 15:50.560
 as long as they have an intact immune system, as long as they come out of response, they can

15:50.560 --> 15:54.800
 have a tremendous amount of infection. I will be talking about people that can't get that.

15:55.920 --> 16:02.960
 The second, and this I think is an important point, growing evidence that an asymptomatic

16:02.960 --> 16:09.440
 vaccinated person is at very low risk for transmitting to others, right? Incredibly low

16:09.440 --> 16:13.760
 chance that they're even going to turn PCR positive. And then we have data suggesting that if they're

16:13.760 --> 16:19.600
 asymptomatic and PCR positive, that is at such a low level that it may actually be below level of

16:19.600 --> 16:24.000
 transmission. So that was the second part. What are the other caveats I think that need to be put

16:24.000 --> 16:30.480
 into this whole situation? 4% of people in the US have impaired immune systems due to disease

16:30.480 --> 16:36.480
 or medications. So that's about 10 million people that are unable to protect themselves

16:36.480 --> 16:43.840
 with active vaccination, right? So they are relying on the kindness, the decision to get

16:43.840 --> 16:51.360
 vaccinated, the masking, the non pharmaceutical and the vaccine mitigation measures. The other

16:51.360 --> 16:58.080
 is what about children 11 and under who do not have access to the vaccination and the protection

16:58.080 --> 17:03.840
 that this could offer? That's another 50 million people here, right? Who are at risk if someone is

17:03.840 --> 17:10.560
 unvaccinated, infected with SARS-CoV-2 and walking around? The other point that people are bringing

17:10.560 --> 17:16.720
 up and I think is relevant is children 12 to 15 just got access. So millions of these kids who

17:16.720 --> 17:21.440
 have not had time to get that second shot, not had time to get to that full protection.

17:21.440 --> 17:27.840
 And so many, many, rightfully so in the US worry that unvaccinated people will be dishonest

17:28.560 --> 17:34.640
 and take their masks off around vulnerable people and infect them giving them COVID. So

17:35.440 --> 17:42.480
 I think there's a lot going on here. The only state that I'm aware of with any sort of a real

17:42.480 --> 17:51.200
 robust verification system is New York here with our Excelsior Pass, which is already being used

17:51.200 --> 17:55.760
 and already planned for use for sporting events to verify that you get to sit in that vaccinated

17:55.760 --> 18:02.560
 section, et cetera. So remember, the CDC is not the police. They are a public health agency and

18:02.560 --> 18:06.960
 this is the science. The policing, that's going to be someone else's job.

18:07.920 --> 18:12.000
 Now, one of the things that comes up in this context is people who say, well, I don't know if

18:12.000 --> 18:18.800
 I need to get a vaccine because I already had the COVID. I should be fine. So what about that?

18:18.800 --> 18:24.640
 How much protection against reinfection do you get with prior infection? And boy, have we come

18:24.640 --> 18:29.280
 far in a year, right? A year ago, there was the whole discussion is reinfection even a thing.

18:29.280 --> 18:34.560
 Well, I think we've moved past that. And now really the question is, what rate are we seeing

18:34.560 --> 18:39.920
 this? If you've been infected, what percent does that protect you relative to vaccination,

18:39.920 --> 18:43.920
 for instance? And I've always been shocked that there's a group of people out there who would

18:43.920 --> 18:53.760
 who would somehow prefer natural infection to a vaccine. I'm seeing a lady now who got chicken

18:53.760 --> 18:58.960
 pox, right, instead of a vaccine. And she has this recurrent zoster all over her face. She actually

18:58.960 --> 19:05.760
 have to wear a mask. She keeps having issues trying to get employment because at job interviews,

19:06.480 --> 19:11.120
 this is an issue. Polio, right? I think Vincent right up your alley. If you could get a polio

19:11.120 --> 19:15.520
 vaccine or just take that chance of maybe a little bit of paralysis for the rest of your life. I

19:15.520 --> 19:21.360
 always shocked here. But here's some data. And this was the study Risk of SARS-CoV-2

19:21.360 --> 19:27.920
 reinfection in a university student population published in CID, Clinical Infectious Disease.

19:28.800 --> 19:38.080
 And they reported on a retrospective analysis of 2021 students with prior infection and 14,080

19:38.080 --> 19:46.880
 students without previous infection. So these were age 17 to 24. And they reported an 84% lower risk

19:46.880 --> 19:52.560
 of infection compared to the unvaccinated students over a study period of four months.

19:53.120 --> 19:56.880
 So I just want to give a comparator here. Remember, this is an age group with almost 100%

19:56.880 --> 20:04.560
 protection with vaccination. And here only an 84% reduction with prior infection. And this is

20:04.560 --> 20:11.600
 just in that window just the four months. So my takeaway here is we saw dozens of reinfections

20:12.320 --> 20:18.480
 in these young adults in this short period. Prior infection is not vaccination testing.

20:18.480 --> 20:24.880
 Never miss an opportunity to test. We are back into the realm. I want to remind everyone of the

20:24.880 --> 20:31.040
 indeterminate test. We now have rates that are dropping back so low that we are back to those

20:31.040 --> 20:35.600
 issues of what is the positive predictive value and what is the negative predictive

20:35.600 --> 20:40.560
 value of a test. And if our listeners remember that far back, but I'm glad that we're circling

20:40.560 --> 20:45.440
 back to there. This is the situation where I'll start with sort of the high numbers.

20:45.440 --> 20:52.560
 Back when we had a disease prevalence of 30%. If you used a test that was 80% sensitive,

20:52.560 --> 20:57.680
 99% specific, right? We're thinking of like PCR, some of our antigen tests here.

20:57.680 --> 21:05.840
 If a person had a positive test, 97% of the time that was truly positive. Only 3% of the time was

21:05.840 --> 21:12.000
 that false. If it was negative, your negative predictive value is up in the 90s as well.

21:12.000 --> 21:16.720
 But what happens when we drop to where we are now? What if the disease prevalence is down at 1%

21:17.760 --> 21:23.120
 using that same test? If it's negative, okay, it is negative with even higher certainty than we

21:23.120 --> 21:29.440
 had to begin with. But what if it is positive? The false positive rate now is going to exceed

21:29.440 --> 21:36.160
 50%. It's going to be at 55%. So now it's becoming really important at a lot of our testing sites

21:36.160 --> 21:40.880
 to have that second test ready to go. So if you get a positive, or what I will say,

21:40.880 --> 21:46.400
 an indeterminate initial result, you want to be ready to employ a second test to determine if

21:46.400 --> 21:51.120
 that's really a true positive. And this is also going to be a little bit of communication with

21:51.120 --> 21:55.440
 each state's Department of Health. Do they want that indeterminate reported? How are you allowed

21:55.440 --> 22:00.160
 to respond? All right, active vaccination never miss an opportunity to vaccinate.

22:01.120 --> 22:07.520
 And I will call this perhaps patience is a good thing. And so we saw the preprint results of a

22:07.520 --> 22:13.680
 study looking at extended interval boosting of the Pfizer, BioNTech vaccine entitled

22:13.680 --> 22:22.400
 extended interval, BNT162B2 vaccination enhances peak antibody generation in older people. And

22:22.400 --> 22:26.960
 can you guess what they saw? Well, yes, this is the secret of a well crafted title. It's all right

22:26.960 --> 22:34.240
 there. The authors reported on 175 people over the age of 80 and found a peak antibody response

22:34.240 --> 22:41.040
 that was 3.5 fold higher with an extended interval of 11 to 12 weeks versus the standard

22:41.040 --> 22:47.120
 three weeks, right? So 3.5 times higher by just waiting that extra point. And I think this makes

22:47.120 --> 22:53.040
 sense, right? We did our studies at three weeks at four weeks, you know, because as I tell my

22:53.040 --> 22:59.440
 daughter, Eloise, 95% is good enough. We don't need 98, you know, these older individuals where

22:59.440 --> 23:05.280
 maybe we don't have as robust responses we might like, also start thinking about those people with

23:05.280 --> 23:12.000
 immunocompromise where there were issues, maybe an extended interval, even we'll talk in the future

23:12.000 --> 23:18.640
 about some of these heterologous or mix and match boosting approaches. For a population,

23:18.640 --> 23:23.600
 we may be getting where we need to be, right? Because I think it was quoted on the last

23:23.600 --> 23:29.120
 twiv, a little bit of discussion there with Kathy and Alan and Rich and the gang about

23:29.680 --> 23:33.920
 if someone gets vaccinated, we're only seeing your chance of dying only. And I think I'm going to

23:33.920 --> 23:39.520
 use the word only here is one in 500,000 people. And that includes all these people who come back

23:39.520 --> 23:44.720
 with a negative antibody test, come back with a low tight or anybody test after vaccines.

23:44.720 --> 23:49.840
 The vaccines are incredibly effective. I don't know if we need 3.5 higher, but at least it says

23:49.840 --> 23:54.720
 that if there is a weight, depending on your vaccination strategy, you're not getting lower

23:54.720 --> 23:59.600
 antibodies, you're actually getting significantly higher. Three, the period of detectable viral

23:59.600 --> 24:04.800
 replication, the viral symptom phase, as I like to say, the time for monitoring and monoclonals.

24:05.360 --> 24:10.720
 And remember, NSAIDs are fine for symptom relief. I'm going to sort of combine pull-in passive

24:10.720 --> 24:15.760
 vaccination and the early inflammatory phase here together. And part of it, I'm going to bring up

24:15.760 --> 24:22.640
 the issue that timing matters. So what am I talking about here? So we finally saw the peer-reviewed

24:22.640 --> 24:30.080
 results of the recovery trial results on convalescent plasma in patients admitted to hospital

24:30.080 --> 24:35.360
 in the Lancet. So as people may know, I feel like that's a little bit late, right? We're waiting

24:35.360 --> 24:40.640
 until the early inflammatory phase. We're not getting convalescent plasma in during that first

24:40.640 --> 24:47.520
 week. Well, let's see what we saw here. The title was convalescent plasma in patients admitted to

24:47.520 --> 24:57.440
 hospital with COVID-19 recovery, a randomized controlled open-label platform trial. And at this

24:57.440 --> 25:03.120
 point, our listeners are perhaps familiar with their recovery trial out of the UK. And just what

25:03.120 --> 25:07.840
 are those letters stand for? This is a randomized controlled open-label platform trial, randomized

25:07.840 --> 25:15.280
 evaluation of COVID-19 therapy, looking really at several possible treatments in patients with

25:15.280 --> 25:23.920
 COVID-19 in the UK. The trial is still underway at 177 NHS hospitals from across the UK.

25:24.560 --> 25:29.840
 And this is the trial that introduced steroids at the right time, in the right patients,

25:30.640 --> 25:36.400
 at the right dose as the standard of care. We also got some significant results from

25:36.400 --> 25:43.440
 recovery on the potential harm and lack of benefit of HCQ. And most recently, the compelling data

25:43.440 --> 25:49.760
 demonstrating the mortality benefits and other benefits of adding tosyllism app to steroids

25:49.760 --> 25:56.320
 for the treatment of COVID at the right time in the right patient. And this paper describes

25:56.320 --> 26:03.280
 the results of patients who are randomly assigned one to one to receive either usual care or usual

26:03.280 --> 26:10.320
 care plus high-tighter convalescent plasma. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality,

26:10.320 --> 26:20.080
 and it was analyzed on an intent to treat basis. So between May 28th, 2020 and January 15th, 2021,

26:20.080 --> 26:28.880
 11,558 individuals were assigned to either the convalescent plasma group or the usual care group.

26:28.880 --> 26:35.920
 And what did they find? They reported no significant difference in 28-day mortality between the two

26:35.920 --> 26:44.000
 groups, 24% versus 24%. The 28-day mortality rate was similar in all pre-specified subgroups of

26:44.000 --> 26:49.440
 patients. No significant effect on the proportion of patients discharged from the hospital within

26:49.440 --> 26:59.280
 28 days, again, 66% in the convalescent plasma, 66% in the usual care. Among those not uninvasive

26:59.280 --> 27:04.560
 mechanical ventilation at randomization, again, no significant difference in the proportion of

27:04.560 --> 27:09.200
 patients, meaning the composite endpoint, a progression to invasive mechanical ventilation

27:09.200 --> 27:17.840
 or death. So in summary, this was a robust, well-powered study using high-tighter convalescent plasma

27:17.840 --> 27:22.320
 early after admission. So they were getting it in within, it was a median of two days after admission.

27:23.280 --> 27:29.040
 No benefit was observed. If anything, I feel like I'm quoting Mark Chrislep,

27:29.040 --> 27:34.560
 a non-statistically significant trend toward a 20% higher rate of mechanical ventilation if you

27:34.560 --> 27:40.480
 look closely at Figure 2. So that means that, yeah, there was a trend there, but they did not actually

27:40.480 --> 27:46.320
 find benefit anywhere. There was a little bit of a suggestion that maybe if you had a larger study,

27:46.320 --> 27:52.640
 you would have started to see harm, actually. They also did a meta-analysis of the 10 major trials

27:52.640 --> 27:59.280
 to date. And I will say here, again, the totality of data putting all these trials together did not

27:59.280 --> 28:06.480
 support a benefit to convalescent plasma for hospitalized patients. Now, the authors did comment

28:06.480 --> 28:12.240
 that recovery only included patients admitted to hospital. So this trial doesn't really address

28:12.240 --> 28:17.600
 whether or not there's maybe a narrow window early in disease where convalescent plasma might

28:17.600 --> 28:26.640
 provide some benefit. And that question has not yet been robustly tested in a sufficiently

28:26.640 --> 28:32.320
 large randomized control trial. And they actually did reference a trial that we've discussed here,

28:32.320 --> 28:37.840
 which was the New England Journal trial. This was early high Titer Plasmotherapy to prevent

28:37.840 --> 28:44.240
 severe COVID-19 in older adults. And that was that small study with 80 patients in a geriatric

28:44.240 --> 28:50.480
 unit in Argentina who got plasma within 72 hours. And there there was a report of some benefit on

28:50.480 --> 28:57.120
 disease progression. So just sort of putting, I will say, the hospitalized patients really robust

28:57.120 --> 29:04.640
 data from this trial, as well as a meta-analysis of 10 other trials, really a labor-intensive

29:04.640 --> 29:11.280
 approach. And we're not seeing data here to support it. But is there something that's sort of similar

29:11.280 --> 29:17.360
 that can be given during that first seven to 10 days? What about those monoclonal cocktails?

29:17.920 --> 29:22.960
 So we got another press release. This was actually presented at a conference. But what was the

29:22.960 --> 29:29.760
 press release? This was from Regeneron. Phase 3 data that was also presented at the American

29:29.760 --> 29:36.800
 thoracic Society 2021 meeting. Regen Kove. So this is the Casariva Mab with

29:36.800 --> 29:44.640
 MDivumab, reduced risk of hospitalization or death by 70% in non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

29:44.640 --> 29:51.600
 So this was a phase three randomized double-blind placebo control trial, evaluating the Regeneron

29:51.600 --> 30:01.120
 cocktail in 4,567 high-risk patients with COVID-19. And they studied two doses, right? The currently

30:01.120 --> 30:10.880
 authorized 2,400 milligram dose and a 1,200 milligram dose, so half the dose. And they evaluated all

30:10.880 --> 30:16.320
 these patients for efficacy. They all had one of the risk factors, right, to include them in this

30:16.320 --> 30:23.440
 study. And the Regeneron Kove cocktail met its primary and all secondary endpoints with similar

30:23.440 --> 30:30.000
 efficacy for both doses. And they saw this for 1,200 milligrams or 2,400 milligrams. So

30:30.000 --> 30:37.840
 70% and 71% reduced risk of hospitalization or death through day 29 compared to placebo for

30:37.840 --> 30:46.160
 both doses. A four-day shorter time to symptom resolution and reduced viral load. And that had

30:46.160 --> 30:56.640
 a p-value of 0.0001 for both. Great safety data, as mentioned, there's thousands of individuals.

30:56.640 --> 31:02.560
 One person had an anaphylactic reaction that resolved with therapy. A little bit more on monoclonal.

31:02.560 --> 31:09.200
 So this was again another exciting week. Updated and expanded emergency use authorization for

31:09.200 --> 31:15.200
 the monoclonal cocktails, now including more medical conditions. And the BMI has been dropped

31:15.200 --> 31:21.440
 down to only being greater than 25. So just to give a sense of what that means. So for a man

31:21.440 --> 31:28.560
 who is my height, 5 foot 10, I would only need to weigh 175 pounds or more to be allowed to

31:28.560 --> 31:34.800
 squeeze in under BMI alone. So this is really expanding down to many of us, except maybe those

31:34.800 --> 31:39.520
 really fit athletic people like my son, Barnaby, who keeps getting new personal records in the mile.

31:40.400 --> 31:47.600
 But we also had, and I think this is critical to updated info on efficacy relative to different

31:47.600 --> 31:53.760
 variants. So this is what worries me about the variants is the impact on monoclonal therapy.

31:53.760 --> 32:02.320
 So in these new updated FDA EUA documents, there are a couple tables. There's a table looking at

32:02.880 --> 32:11.760
 the variant substitutions and their impact on the Eli Lilly cocktail with the B117. No change

32:11.760 --> 32:19.760
 in susceptibility. But when we get into the B1351, originally described in South Africa,

32:20.560 --> 32:27.760
 we are seeing a 215 fold reduction in susceptibility. When we look at the P1, say originally described

32:27.760 --> 32:33.520
 in Brazil, we are seeing greater than 46. Remember, both of these have very similar

32:33.520 --> 32:47.920
 key substitutions. So the K417N or T, the E484K and the N501Y. And then the B1427 and the B1429,

32:47.920 --> 32:55.360
 originally described in California, that have the L452R about a ninefold reduction. And the B1526,

32:55.360 --> 33:02.320
 that's New York City's, that also has the E44K, that's about a 31 fold reduction in susceptibility.

33:02.320 --> 33:09.840
 So in contrast, the Regeneron cocktail did not show any fold reduction in susceptibility

33:09.840 --> 33:16.800
 for any of these key substitutions or for any of these variants. So it now becomes, I'll say,

33:16.800 --> 33:23.360
 pretty critical when you're deciding which monoclonal cocktail to use to have a sense of what variants

33:23.360 --> 33:29.840
 are prevalent in your area. Because you may be having reduced benefit to your therapy,

33:29.840 --> 33:33.760
 if you're giving it to a patient who has one of these key substitutions.

33:33.760 --> 33:37.520
 Still in this section, remember, this is that early inflammatory phase.

33:37.520 --> 33:43.600
 So if those oxygen saturations drop below 94, that's when we have data that steroids,

33:43.600 --> 33:50.560
 dexamethasone, 6 milligrams a day for 10 days, improves outcomes, is associated with a mortality

33:50.560 --> 33:57.040
 benefit. Be careful with higher or longer doses, remdesivir, minor impact at huge expense,

33:57.040 --> 34:04.640
 still recommending anticoagulation for our hospitalized patients. At least prophylactic dose is

34:04.640 --> 34:09.920
 associated with improved outcomes, mortality benefit. We still really need better studies in this space.

34:09.920 --> 34:16.480
 Oxygen and pulmonary support, as we're seeing in India, so critical to have that ability to

34:16.480 --> 34:22.400
 deliver oxygen. Antibiotics, not helpful for treating viral infections and can be harmful.

34:22.400 --> 34:28.960
 As we mentioned, tosyllizumab can be added to steroids in a certain subset of patients,

34:29.520 --> 34:35.600
 appears to have a mortality benefit if used appropriately early in patients not responding to

34:35.600 --> 34:41.520
 steroids. And all right, we're going to get into our tail phase of our discussion, our long COVID

34:41.520 --> 34:47.360
 part. We have, finally, I have the paper, I say, finally, because this was preprint. Now it's

34:47.360 --> 34:54.160
 published in BMJ. I spent some time going through this. The paper is risk of clinical sequelae

34:54.160 --> 35:00.240
 after the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection, retrospective cohort study. And this was in the

35:00.240 --> 35:10.400
 BMJ. And this was generated really from a huge data set of 266,586 individuals with SARS-CoV-2

35:10.400 --> 35:17.200
 infection aged 18 to 65. So I sort of encourage you, we're looking at a younger group of patients

35:17.200 --> 35:22.480
 here than some of the other studies. And at minimum, right, I'm hoping Vincent will post this on

35:22.480 --> 35:27.680
 parasites without borders for people to link into. But I encourage listeners to go there and to

35:27.680 --> 35:33.200
 at minimum look at figure two in this paper. There's a few takeaways from this paper.

35:33.920 --> 35:40.080
 One of them is that 14% of adults aged less than or equal to 65 who were infected with

35:40.080 --> 35:46.480
 SARS-CoV-2 had at least one new type of clinical sequelae that required medical care

35:46.480 --> 35:53.280
 after the acute phase of the illness, right? So we're seeing about 14% here in the under 65.

35:54.160 --> 35:59.520
 The people at higher risk were those people that had been in the hospital.

36:00.640 --> 36:04.560
 Just to shout out to some of the authors, actually a couple of these authors are friends of mine.

36:04.560 --> 36:10.640
 I work with them at United Health Group, Sarah Daugherty. We've been working on a bunch of long

36:10.640 --> 36:16.800
 COVID stuff and Ken Cohen. We published a paper a little while back together. But let's just hit a

36:16.800 --> 36:22.400
 little bit about why am I telling you to look at figure two. One of the really difficult things

36:22.400 --> 36:29.040
 is that people who get acute COVID can end up with a number of other clinical sequelae at

36:29.040 --> 36:35.200
 significantly higher levels. And what are those? Not surprising, interstitial lung disease,

36:35.200 --> 36:42.640
 the hazard ratio for that is greater than 7.5. This is really troubling. And I know I come back

36:42.640 --> 36:49.840
 to this a lot, but encephalopathy. This is about a hazard ratio of greater than six. And this is

36:49.840 --> 36:55.760
 really difficult. You see a lot of really high functioning individuals who now are having difficulty

36:55.760 --> 37:02.320
 on so many levels and actually being told, oh, it's all in your head, et cetera. Well, I guess it's

37:02.320 --> 37:10.800
 all inside the skull. Yes, it is damage and impact on the brain. We're also seeing cardiomyopathy.

37:11.440 --> 37:17.360
 And that's about three has ratio about three. We're seeing heart failure. We're seeing arrhythmias.

37:17.360 --> 37:22.640
 We're seeing memory difficulty amnesia. We're seeing these people being more than twice as

37:22.640 --> 37:29.360
 likely to develop a stroke, peripheral neuropathy. A lot of these are small fiber issues affecting

37:29.360 --> 37:35.360
 gut motility and other things. So really a tough space. And a lot of people are trying to jump in

37:35.360 --> 37:42.000
 and understand. And we're looking forward to the CDC guidance on this. And I guess I should say,

37:42.000 --> 37:47.600
 we're still waiting for that really good data on people with long COVID and the impact of vaccines.

37:47.600 --> 37:54.640
 So I'll say a friend and colleague of mine, Akiko Iwasaki up at Yale. She's actually come on Fridays

37:54.640 --> 38:01.280
 to our Steve Goff weekly lab meetings. So I got to know her then. And she has a long COVID study.

38:01.280 --> 38:07.360
 So people can just email covidrecovery at Yale.edu. If you have long COVID and you're thinking about

38:07.360 --> 38:13.360
 getting a vaccine, that's a great way to connect. And then we can start getting some really good data.

38:13.360 --> 38:19.040
 We continue to see this. I say anecdotally, which, you know, the plural of anecdote is not data.

38:19.040 --> 38:24.800
 It's anecdotes. And so we really want to get this quantified. We want to get a sense of who gets

38:24.800 --> 38:29.440
 better or the timing, et cetera. So all right, I'm going to close there. And I'm going to say,

38:29.440 --> 38:34.080
 thank you everyone for your incredibly generous support going to parasites without borders

38:34.080 --> 38:38.160
 and helping us support femric and all the great work Foundation International Medical

38:38.160 --> 38:43.600
 Relief of Children continues to do throughout the world. These are tough times and no one safe

38:43.600 --> 38:50.640
 until everyone is safe. Time for some questions for Daniel. You can send yours to Daniel at microbe.tv.

38:50.640 --> 38:57.920
 Patricia writes, one topic I have not seen anywhere is drug metabolism. I seem to be a poor metabolizer

38:57.920 --> 39:04.240
 of drugs. I've been like this my life. Even Asper cream can put me to sleep night quill. I'm out for

39:04.240 --> 39:10.240
 24 hours. These are just two examples. At age 58, I feel getting vaccinated is important, but I

39:10.240 --> 39:15.840
 don't dare try because of how I always react to drugs. If I can handle any, it's a child's dosage

39:15.840 --> 39:22.400
 at best. Can you point me to more info on this? I can't seem to find any discussion on this topic

39:22.400 --> 39:26.800
 as it relates to vaccine. Or if you know the answer to whether it would be safe for me to get

39:26.800 --> 39:32.400
 vaccinated, that would be helpful too. Okay. Well, I'm going to encourage you to get vaccinated

39:32.400 --> 39:37.520
 first off. But let me explain what I know. Usually I tell people, oh, these are vaccines. They're

39:37.520 --> 39:42.400
 not something that gets metabolized. But there is a little bit of detail here. And I'll go into

39:42.400 --> 39:48.480
 what do we know about this? People who are on particular medications that are metabolized by

39:48.480 --> 39:56.160
 the liver so that hepatic cytochrome SIP 450 system. We actually can see sometimes, and we think it's

39:56.160 --> 40:01.040
 cytokine induced, right? You get your vaccine, there's that reactogenicity. Sometimes if anything,

40:01.040 --> 40:06.240
 it can increase the metabolism of certain medications. And we want to know about stuff like this,

40:06.240 --> 40:10.480
 right? If somebody's on Warfarin, okay, no interaction there. Some other medications,

40:10.480 --> 40:15.200
 what actually is happening here is improving the metabolism. It's speeding up to metabolism of

40:15.200 --> 40:19.920
 certain medications. Most of the studies in this area have not suggested that it's

40:20.640 --> 40:26.480
 of significant or clinical relevance. But yeah, there is a little bit of a subtle issue here.

40:26.480 --> 40:31.440
 But if you're a poor metabolizer, well, temporarily, you're going to be a slightly better metabolizer.

40:31.440 --> 40:35.600
 Victoria writes, I'm the parent of the 13 year old daughter who has down syndrome.

40:35.600 --> 40:40.880
 My family has been careful during the year working in schooling from home, reducing our risk. But

40:40.880 --> 40:45.840
 this has come at great cost to our 13 year old schooling and social development because remote

40:45.840 --> 40:50.800
 school has been pretty much miserable and ineffective for her. So my household awaits with great

40:50.800 --> 40:55.280
 anticipation. The news that we can have our door to vaccinate when Pfizer is authorized,

40:55.280 --> 40:59.440
 but I can't help wonder, will the vaccine be sufficiently effective for people with

40:59.440 --> 41:04.720
 down syndrome? Or is it likely that my family should expect that the vaccine will not offer our

41:04.720 --> 41:10.720
 daughter substantial protection? I suspect there's scant empirical evidence. But what might you

41:10.720 --> 41:16.800
 predict based on your knowledge of the immune system of folks with trisomy 21?

41:18.160 --> 41:24.160
 Yeah, no, this, this is a great question. And we are starting to expand from just the, oh,

41:24.160 --> 41:29.520
 how does this group of 30,000 people respond to looking at some of these other populations?

41:29.520 --> 41:33.840
 And we discussed the last time about people with transplant, people with other immune issues.

41:33.840 --> 41:37.760
 Now, a couple of things I'm going to say, I'm going to say I am actually quite optimistic

41:37.760 --> 41:41.440
 from what we know about these vaccines and what we know about the immune system,

41:41.440 --> 41:45.680
 that an individual down syndrome will get excellent. I'm going to say excellent. And

41:45.680 --> 41:50.640
 adolescent with with down syndrome should get excellent response. We saw in the trial

41:50.640 --> 41:57.600
 of adolescents 100% protection against even a positive PCR test with Pfizer. And that's pretty

41:57.600 --> 42:05.040
 amazing. Let's say that you drop that down to 90%. That's still really impressive. And if it's not

42:05.040 --> 42:11.280
 a negative PCR test, is it going to at least be, should there be a positive PCR is lower level?

42:11.920 --> 42:16.880
 So I actually, I would optimistically say I would go ahead, I would get that vaccine.

42:16.880 --> 42:22.640
 The efficacy looks really impressive. So even if it's a little bit reduced in

42:22.640 --> 42:27.760
 some with down syndrome, because of the issues there, we have a lot of margin of reduction here.

42:28.640 --> 42:33.200
 Mike in South Jersey writes, the day after receiving the second dose of Pfizer vaccine,

42:33.200 --> 42:37.600
 I developed an irregular heartbeat. I have had symptoms the past six days,

42:37.600 --> 42:42.720
 which tend to be worse at rest. I have yet to determine if I also have myocarditis after going

42:42.720 --> 42:47.360
 to my primary care physician and cardiologist. I was surprised to learn that this is becoming

42:47.360 --> 42:51.760
 more and more common. Can you please discuss this issue? Do you have any idea what might be causing

42:51.760 --> 42:56.720
 it? I'm a 42 year old male who exercises regularly and eats healthy.

42:56.720 --> 42:59.840
 Yeah, so I think this is great. I want to try to put this in context.

43:01.920 --> 43:06.000
 Right now, we're getting to the point where what the majority of Americans have gotten,

43:06.000 --> 43:09.760
 at least majority of adult Americans have gotten at least one dose of vaccine.

43:09.760 --> 43:14.240
 So it's almost like in the history of every patient, like when their vaccines were done.

43:15.200 --> 43:21.040
 So it's pretty soon going to be uncommon that someone was not vaccinated. So do we see myocarditis?

43:21.040 --> 43:25.920
 Yes. Do we see myocarditis at a higher rate in people that are vaccinated? I'm not sure that's

43:25.920 --> 43:30.960
 true. I'm speaking to one of my cardiologist colleagues today about some basically things

43:30.960 --> 43:35.920
 that are noticing. One was the issue, oh, this individual had low platelets. And so in their

43:35.920 --> 43:41.440
 mind, they had made a connection. This is being actively looked into, particularly with the Pfizer

43:41.440 --> 43:49.280
 vaccine, for instance, do people who get the Pfizer vaccine have a higher incidence of really

43:49.280 --> 43:55.920
 anything, particularly myocarditis, arrhythmias. So far, we're not seeing that looking at the vaccine

43:55.920 --> 44:00.880
 reporting system, looking at all this robust tracking. We still see what we see. People get

44:00.880 --> 44:05.120
 vaccinated. They get bitten by dogs. They get bitten by cats. They get in car crashes. They

44:05.120 --> 44:12.320
 have arrhythmias. They basically, all the things that we see, we still see. And it's not clear

44:12.320 --> 44:16.080
 that the myocarditis, the arrhythmias, are actually at a higher level. So certainly that

44:16.080 --> 44:21.280
 doctor will say, boy, of the last so many people I saw, 60% of them had been vaccinated. But you

44:21.280 --> 44:29.360
 know what? 60% of all people have been vaccinated. So it's sort of tricky to actually look at what

44:29.360 --> 44:34.800
 you're seeing and then really use a robust system to determine whether or not there's any causal

44:34.800 --> 44:41.440
 link here. That is COVID-19 clinical update number 63 with Dr. Daniel Griffin. Thank you, Daniel.

44:41.440 --> 45:11.280
 Oh, thank you so much. And everyone be safe.
