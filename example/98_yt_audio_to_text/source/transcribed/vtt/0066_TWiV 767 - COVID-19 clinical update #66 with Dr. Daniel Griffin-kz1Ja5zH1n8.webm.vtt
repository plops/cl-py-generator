 This week in virology, the podcast about viruses, the kind that make you sick.

00:10.400 --> 00:21.280
 From Microbe TV, this is Twiv, this week in virology, Episode 767, recorded on June 10, 2021.

00:21.840 --> 00:28.160
 I'm Vincent Racken Yello, and you are listening to the podcast all about viruses joining me today

00:28.160 --> 00:34.240
 from New York, Daniel Griffin. Hello, everyone. Well, Daniel, you got another

00:34.240 --> 00:40.800
 wide-body aircraft, 767. That's what I was hoping. So I'm happy with that. You know,

00:40.800 --> 00:44.000
 you got to take what you can. What's the biggest aircraft do we know?

00:45.280 --> 00:50.480
 Is it Alan? We need Alan to be known as the biggest aircraft ever. I don't know. I have no idea.

00:51.520 --> 00:57.040
 When I was a kid, I actually flew as a kid, but I preferred gliders. I always been that like

00:57.040 --> 01:02.160
 sailing gliders. And it's just something amazing about being up there without an engine,

01:02.160 --> 01:09.440
 and then catching the thermals spiraling up. Gliding looks great, but I don't want to do it.

01:09.440 --> 01:17.040
 I'm good. All right, let's start with our quotation. The idea that some lives matter less is the

01:17.040 --> 01:22.480
 root of all that is wrong with the world. And that's Paul Farmer. I don't know if people are

01:22.480 --> 01:28.480
 familiar with Paul Farmer. He's actually the co-founder and chief strategist of Partners in

01:28.480 --> 01:34.880
 Health, which is a pretty significant international nonprofit organization that's existed since the

01:34.880 --> 01:41.840
 1980s, providing health care services, but also involved in research and advocacy.

01:42.480 --> 01:48.400
 And I have to admit, my first exposure to Paul Farmer was reading the book Mountains Beyond

01:48.400 --> 01:53.680
 Mountains by Tracy Kitter. And that's really a must read for. I was going to say for people

01:53.680 --> 01:59.280
 going into global health, but I'm just going to say it's a must read, just a really impressive,

01:59.280 --> 02:04.320
 inspiring individual. And really, my wife and I were actually talking about Paul Farmer the

02:04.320 --> 02:11.200
 other night, just about how he truly lives this message. He really treats every human being

02:12.320 --> 02:17.040
 as if they're the most important person in the world. My wife says that she and I are a little

02:17.040 --> 02:23.120
 too tribal. Our kids come first, and everyone else second. For Paul, I think he treats everyone

02:23.120 --> 02:29.120
 like they're his son, his daughter. So I think as we're going into the next phase, we're going to

02:29.120 --> 02:37.760
 have to realize that the developed nations, the nations with more resources really need to be

02:37.760 --> 02:44.080
 there for everyone. You know, you can't have J&J vaccines expiring while people are still

02:44.080 --> 02:49.440
 dying in many parts of the world without access. So I thought I would start with that as our quotation,

02:50.160 --> 02:59.120
 but let me give an update. Today was a milestone at the two hospitals where I spent my

03:00.000 --> 03:06.720
 morning, earlier part of the day, not a single COVID case, not a single active COVID case in

03:06.720 --> 03:12.000
 either hospital. You know, over at some of the other hospitals, there are still some COVID cases,

03:12.000 --> 03:19.520
 but boy, COVID has fallen off a cliff here in my immediate area. You know, the weather's getting

03:19.520 --> 03:25.040
 better. There's a combination of vaccines and also boy, a bunch of people got infected already.

03:25.040 --> 03:30.000
 So we really have things going in the right direction. And what I'm going to start with is

03:30.000 --> 03:36.800
 actually we have learned a lot. So we have a lot of evidence based recommendations now, which

03:36.800 --> 03:41.520
 really makes my world a lot better. So I was just going to start with sort of the executive

03:41.520 --> 03:47.040
 summary of the ID Society of America's guidelines, just what they're recommending for and against,

03:47.040 --> 03:52.400
 but I'm going to give a little context. So there's there's 19 recommendations, some of them are kind

03:52.400 --> 03:58.560
 of, you know, combinations, so to speak. So recommendation number one, hydroxychloroquine

03:58.560 --> 04:07.680
 against recommendation to hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin also against not using

04:07.680 --> 04:14.320
 lopinovir azithromycin, not using lopinovir ritonovir. The next recommendation four and five

04:14.320 --> 04:22.880
 dexamethasone, not in the outpatient, but recommended in the inpatient setting if a person has a

04:22.880 --> 04:30.800
 oxygen saturation less than 94%. Recommendation seven for those hospitalized patients with

04:30.800 --> 04:37.760
 progressive severe COVID-19 with elevated markers of systemic inflammation, escalation in that

04:37.760 --> 04:44.400
 oxygen requirement, suggesting the use of toselism map, right, the IL six receptor blocker among

04:44.400 --> 04:51.760
 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 recommending against convalescent plasma. As far as the ambulatory

04:51.760 --> 04:58.320
 patients want to get some more studies on that, but not not just doing it as a standard remdesivir

04:58.320 --> 05:05.360
 falling into that same criteria, the hospitalized patient less than 94%. But if that patient actually

05:05.360 --> 05:11.360
 is more severe, invasive ventilation recommending against it, people actually do worse. So timing

05:11.360 --> 05:19.440
 current theme really matters here and recommending five days, not 10. So five days across the board,

05:19.440 --> 05:25.920
 if you're going to be using remdesivir, again, only in the right patient jumping to femotidine,

05:25.920 --> 05:31.920
 pepsid, you know, those antacids that are going to cure your COVID recommending against

05:31.920 --> 05:39.360
 femotidine, then we get into our monoclonals. And actually now the ID Society of America

05:40.080 --> 05:44.320
 is recommending they've been doing this for a little while, but they are recommending using

05:44.320 --> 05:50.400
 combination monoclonals, such as the BAM, BAM, a testament map in areas with appropriate

05:50.400 --> 05:58.000
 susceptibilities, or the Regeneron Cocktail, Cassie M. Devamap, but not monotherapy with BAM

05:58.000 --> 06:04.640
 LIVAMap. And they haven't quite added the VRGSK monoclonal, which is our third, you know, EUA

06:04.640 --> 06:11.040
 approach. What about barit to sit to nib, right? We haven't really talked too much about that.

06:12.000 --> 06:17.840
 This is actually a therapy that is in there as a recommendation. But as people have probably

06:17.840 --> 06:23.280
 noticed, it really hasn't gotten a lot of uptake, limited evidence that maybe a shortened hospital

06:23.280 --> 06:28.400
 stay by about a day. But it's not something a lot of us are particularly comfortable using,

06:28.400 --> 06:33.440
 but it just, I will give it some mention there. No one's complete without a mention of Ivermectin,

06:33.440 --> 06:38.640
 right? So we are going to return to Ivermectin. But basically they're saying at this point,

06:38.640 --> 06:42.880
 we still need clinical trials. This isn't something that should be used outside of clinical trials,

06:42.880 --> 06:48.960
 we need those clinical trials. But we will get back to Ivermectin. Okay, children and COVID,

06:48.960 --> 06:54.400
 as I like to say, children are at low risk, but they're not at no risk. And I think that's

06:54.400 --> 07:00.320
 reasonable. I think that's accurate. Someone recently suggested to me that now that we're aware that

07:00.320 --> 07:06.640
 every year, over 100 children here in the US die from flu, perhaps now people will be more

07:06.640 --> 07:11.120
 motivated to get their children and themselves vaccinated. I'll never comprehend the lesson

07:11.120 --> 07:17.360
 warm comments I get when I talk about children and and COVID here. But I actually, we are actually

07:17.360 --> 07:21.200
 pointing out some things that maybe people didn't realize. I know early on people said, Oh, we've

07:21.200 --> 07:25.600
 we've been comfortable with 100 children dying every year. I'm not comfortable with 100 children

07:25.600 --> 07:30.560
 dying every year of the flu. And I'm certainly not comfortable with 300 to 500 children having

07:30.560 --> 07:35.520
 died of COVID. You know, I've been working with a lot of schools, summer programs, sporting programs,

07:35.520 --> 07:41.760
 businesses, trying to translate this science into safe mitigation practices, really for

07:42.400 --> 07:48.880
 over a year now. And I do like to reinforce that in all these different settings where I've

07:49.440 --> 07:55.120
 offered free advice, right? Sometimes it wasn't free actually. I think the NHL is supposed to

07:55.120 --> 08:00.720
 send me a paycheck at some point. But we haven't had any we haven't had any transmission. This is

08:00.720 --> 08:04.880
 something that can be done safely. But as I always point out, it's also something that can be done

08:04.880 --> 08:13.120
 unsafely. So more from the CDC MMWR. And this article got quite a bit of press. Hospitalization

08:13.120 --> 08:21.920
 of adolescents age 12 to 17 with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 COVID net 14 states, March 1st,

08:21.920 --> 08:30.160
 2020, April 24, 2021. And this came out as an early release. And the authors reported that COVID-19

08:30.160 --> 08:37.600
 adolescent hospitalization rates peaked at 2.1 per 100,000 in early January. Then we're headed

08:37.600 --> 08:43.920
 in the right direction with this declining to 0.6 in mid March. However, in April 2021,

08:43.920 --> 08:51.840
 the rate more than doubled up to 1.3 per 100,000. Among hospitalized adolescents, nearly one-third

08:51.840 --> 08:59.760
 were admitted to the ICU and 5% required invasive mechanical ventilation. No associated deaths

08:59.760 --> 09:03.040
 were reported during this period of time. A couple of things I want to say about this.

09:04.480 --> 09:12.240
 This is accurate. What they said is true. But doubling from 0.6 per 100,000 up to 1.3 per 100,000,

09:13.360 --> 09:21.360
 the numbers are still low. In my mind, a single preventable death or hospitalization is one too

09:21.360 --> 09:29.280
 many. I already mentioned the comparator to the flu deaths that we see. But this continues

09:29.280 --> 09:34.880
 to be low. And actually, it looks like it's dropping, right? Look at the number of cases.

09:35.760 --> 09:41.840
 It's dropping all across the board. So I think we've learned that the fact that masks and

09:41.840 --> 09:47.280
 social isolation and many other aspects of the pandemic have had a very negative impact on our

09:47.280 --> 09:53.920
 children. So a lot of discussion now and reasonable about moving forward now that the rates are

09:53.920 --> 10:00.800
 very low in a lot of our populations and also that we're rolling out expanding our vaccination

10:00.800 --> 10:06.320
 effort. So I want to say things look good relative to our children. Things look really good relative

10:06.320 --> 10:12.960
 to the summer and next fall. Pre-exposure period transmission. This remains a hot topic.

10:14.320 --> 10:20.640
 I think rightfully so. I recently was emailing a bit with Michael Mena. I think some of our

10:20.640 --> 10:27.040
 listeners know him of the liquor stick and just talking about how, for science communication,

10:27.040 --> 10:35.040
 the concept of aerosol and airborne has been quite difficult. We say, hey, one in 10,000 cases are

10:35.920 --> 10:41.520
 attributable to contact. So oh my gosh, that means COVID is contact transmission. Well,

10:41.520 --> 10:47.120
 it is, but it is usually not in that situation. We've talked about the number of cases that occur

10:47.120 --> 10:52.400
 within the three to six feet in close contact. But we've also clearly discussed that there are

10:52.400 --> 10:57.200
 a number of cases that occur even when you're outside those six feet. And we've talked about

10:57.200 --> 11:03.680
 the role of ventilation improvements where you're clearly beyond that six feet, improving the risk

11:03.680 --> 11:10.400
 reducing the risk of transmission. So hopefully we will get a little better, better language that

11:10.400 --> 11:14.640
 we will have less confusion and controversy and we can really focus on what's important,

11:14.640 --> 11:19.600
 which is keeping people safe and communicating the essential messages on how to do that.

11:19.600 --> 11:23.520
 Why are we talking about Michael Mena? He actually just published another paper.

11:24.400 --> 11:29.840
 And this was out of his group estimating epidemiological dynamics from cross-sectional

11:29.840 --> 11:36.720
 viral load distributions. And this was published in science. And the authors suggest that the

11:36.720 --> 11:43.840
 population distribution of viral loads observed in the form of CT values, right, the cycle threshold

11:43.840 --> 11:53.120
 values that you get from the ECR testing actually changes during a pandemic. And they argue that the

11:53.120 --> 12:00.320
 CT values, even from limited numbers of random samples, can provide estimates of an epidemic's

12:00.320 --> 12:03.920
 trajectory, right? So they're trying to say, this might be a tool we can use.

12:04.800 --> 12:09.440
 Should we see the next pandemic or even in this pandemic? They go on to demonstrate that

12:09.440 --> 12:15.120
 combining data from multiple samples can improve the precision and robustness of this estimation.

12:15.840 --> 12:20.800
 And they looked at CT values from surveillance conducted during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic

12:20.800 --> 12:27.440
 in a variety of settings. And they offer alternative approaches for real-time estimates

12:27.440 --> 12:34.320
 of the epidemic trajectories for this outbreak management based on these values. What they're

12:34.320 --> 12:39.920
 really trying to suggest is they bring up the observed CT values and the fact that they have

12:39.920 --> 12:47.760
 varied over the course of the pandemic and saying you do not need to invoke fitness changes,

12:47.760 --> 12:53.680
 necessarily genetic changes in the virus. There actually can be a trajectory of the pandemic.

12:53.680 --> 12:59.840
 So this is, I have to say, it is a complicated paper, but it is worth reading. So we'll get it up

12:59.840 --> 13:06.000
 there on our website. And I'm going to suggest again that sharing this information, I think it

13:06.000 --> 13:10.960
 should be a standard part of every PCR report, whether it's positive or negative, but also at

13:10.960 --> 13:16.640
 what level it's positive or negative. The more this information is out there and shared. I think

13:16.640 --> 13:23.280
 we're all smart enough, educated enough that we can handle that information and try to make

13:23.280 --> 13:30.000
 something of it. Active vaccination, never miss an opportunity to vaccinate and vaccines are how

13:30.000 --> 13:39.360
 this pandemic ends. And I'm going to try to throw some stories in here. I was throwing these

13:39.360 --> 13:46.880
 stories where a clinician has maybe not managed to patient as best as they might have. And I do

13:46.880 --> 13:52.160
 that as a way of teaching, sort of bringing out people. So I would never do that. And hopefully

13:52.160 --> 13:56.720
 that sticks in their minds. But I do, I get a lot of communication from a lot of really,

13:56.720 --> 14:02.400
 I'm going to say really, really at really hardworking primary care clinicians across the country

14:03.040 --> 14:08.800
 that are not making these mistakes. So I really apply this has been a really tough 18 months and

14:08.800 --> 14:13.600
 a lot of say a lot of our 12 listeners, a lot of physicians out there are really putting in

14:13.600 --> 14:20.000
 those extra hours and staying up to date. We're still seeing these individuals come in. I just

14:20.000 --> 14:26.160
 grabbed an individual last week. I mentioned that the two hospitals I went to today had no COVID,

14:26.160 --> 14:34.160
 but my partner, Anujali just admitted a woman late 50s diabetic, not vaccinated. She was exposed

14:34.160 --> 14:41.120
 because her dad was ill also in the hospital, sort of missed the window for vaccine, missed the window

14:41.120 --> 14:48.080
 for the monoclonals. So I think that we've got to keep hammering on this. You know, this is a

14:48.080 --> 14:54.400
 the Hail Mary as some people like to say for the unvaccinated. Let's talk about not only vaccines,

14:54.400 --> 15:02.000
 but what about prior infection? So there was a paper incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection,

15:02.000 --> 15:07.520
 according to baseline antibody status in staff and residents of 100 long-term care

15:07.520 --> 15:14.720
 facilities, Vivaldi, a prospective cohort study. And this was published in the Lancet

15:14.720 --> 15:21.520
 Healthy Longevity Journal. Now, I do not subscribe to this journal for disclosure, but perhaps I should.

15:22.240 --> 15:29.680
 I mean, who does not want healthy longevity? But this was a prospective cohort study of SARS-CoV-2

15:29.680 --> 15:36.080
 infection in staff less than 65 years of age. Interesting enough. And the residents were all

15:36.080 --> 15:43.360
 over age 65. And they looked at 100 long-term care facilities in England between October 1,

15:43.360 --> 15:50.880
 2020 and February 1, 2021. Now that sounds like a lot, right? But at the end of the day,

15:51.440 --> 15:56.720
 they only ended up looking at 682 residents from 86 of the long-term care facilities

15:57.600 --> 16:04.960
 and 1,429 staff members from 97 long-term care facilities, just, you know, who met criterion

16:04.960 --> 16:14.800
 who could be included. At baseline, IgG antibodies to nuclear capsid were detected in 226 of the

16:14.800 --> 16:23.520
 682 residents, so about a third and 408, so 29%, about a third of the 1,429 staff members.

16:23.520 --> 16:32.720
 They then observed that 20% of the 456 residents who are antibody negative and included at baseline

16:32.720 --> 16:40.560
 went on to have a positive PCR test compared with 2% of the 226 residents who were antibody

16:40.560 --> 16:48.320
 positive at baseline. What about the staff? 11% of the staff that were antibody negative at the

16:48.320 --> 16:54.080
 beginning went on to have a positive versus 2% of the staff who were antibody positive at baseline.

16:54.640 --> 17:01.920
 So they give us adjusted hazard ratio for the serology positive residents of 0.15.

17:01.920 --> 17:08.480
 And for staff, 0.39. Now, what were sort of the interesting things about this study?

17:09.200 --> 17:16.960
 One was that this study had to be kind of impacted because we have the rapid rollout of vaccines

17:16.960 --> 17:23.280
 long-term care facilities in England starting December 8th. So mixed in here is single-dose

17:23.280 --> 17:28.320
 vaccine protection in previously infected, and then the data seems a little bit less clear.

17:28.320 --> 17:33.520
 And this is going to bring up what I think is important challenge for us going forward,

17:33.520 --> 17:40.400
 trying to collect data about the impact of natural infection compared to vaccines,

17:41.120 --> 17:47.680
 and also the issue that we're going to come up to. What about variants? So there was a research

17:47.680 --> 17:52.960
 letter that hit you with another right in here in this section, assessment of SARS-CoV-2

17:52.960 --> 18:01.040
 reinfection in Lombardi, Italy. So now we're moving from UK to Italy. And here the authors are

18:01.040 --> 18:07.200
 reporting on the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 primary infection and reinfection among individuals who

18:07.200 --> 18:14.160
 during the first wave of the pandemic in Italy underwent diagnostic PCR testing. And the results

18:14.160 --> 18:20.720
 of this study suggested that patients who had recovered from SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19 had a lower

18:20.720 --> 18:26.800
 risk of reinfection, and there appeared to be a protective effect out to about a year.

18:27.520 --> 18:33.840
 And the authors here did comment that this observation all ended right before we started

18:33.840 --> 18:40.400
 to see the SARS-CoV-2 variants enter Italy. Now there's a study that actually has gotten a

18:40.400 --> 18:45.600
 lot of attention, so we'll spend a little bit of time on this. And this was a preprint,

18:45.600 --> 18:52.320
 so this is not peer reviewed, and it needs some peer review, necessity of COVID-19 vaccination

18:52.320 --> 18:58.560
 in previously infected individuals. So this preprint was a study looking at employees of

18:58.560 --> 19:04.960
 the Cleveland Clinic Health System. Now fortunately from a science standpoint, but unfortunately

19:04.960 --> 19:10.560
 from a public health standpoint, it did not look like there was great success in terms of vaccine

19:10.560 --> 19:17.120
 uptake. The authors reported that the majority of employees that had been previously infected

19:17.120 --> 19:24.000
 did not get vaccinated, and only 59% of the other employees got vaccinated.

19:24.000 --> 19:28.480
 So not a great job of employees getting vaccinated out there at the Cleveland Clinic.

19:29.200 --> 19:36.240
 They also reported that 5% of their employees ended up getting infected with COVID-19 prior

19:36.240 --> 19:41.360
 to the start of this study. So far, not really great stuff for the Cleveland Clinic here.

19:42.240 --> 19:49.200
 What they did is they performed a retrospective cohort study, and what they obtained was a waiver

19:49.200 --> 19:53.920
 of informed consent, so they did not need any of the employees to actually consent for their data

19:53.920 --> 19:59.600
 to be used here. They got a waiver of HIPAA authorization so that these researchers could

20:00.160 --> 20:04.800
 go ahead and access all these employees' personal health information and records.

20:04.800 --> 20:11.280
 And then the authors compared four groups. So you have group one. These are previously infected,

20:11.280 --> 20:19.520
 unvaccinated, previously infected, vaccinated, not previously infected, unvaccinated, and not

20:19.520 --> 20:24.960
 previously infected, vaccinated. And then they followed these individuals over five months.

20:25.600 --> 20:30.400
 And there's a plot. It's a Simon Makuk plot. Looks a lot like those Kaplan-Meyer curves we

20:30.400 --> 20:37.200
 see over time, the rates of infection. And it's sort of striking to the eyes that the only area

20:37.200 --> 20:42.720
 where you're seeing significant rates of new infection are in the not previously infected,

20:42.720 --> 20:48.560
 unvaccinated population. Now, the authors make several allowances. They do comment that their

20:48.560 --> 20:56.000
 results are quite a bit different from a large study out of Denmark looking at, well, actually,

20:56.000 --> 21:03.200
 it was a population of 4 million PCR tested individuals in Denmark study. So that paper,

21:03.200 --> 21:08.480
 assessment of protection against reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 among 4 million PCR tested

21:08.480 --> 21:15.680
 individuals in Denmark in 2020, a population level observational study. The authors commented

21:15.680 --> 21:23.680
 that that study suggested only about an 80.5% reduction and only a 47.1% reduction in those

21:23.680 --> 21:30.880
 over the age of 65. So they comment that their results in this preprint are quite a bit different,

21:30.880 --> 21:36.800
 quite a bit more rosy and encouraging than we saw in that study. Their study also was only a

21:36.800 --> 21:41.280
 five-month follow-up, right? So we sort of have this idea that you don't test people for the first

21:41.280 --> 21:45.760
 three. So a lot of people have asked me about, was it really just a two-month follow-up? So

21:46.400 --> 21:52.000
 you got to look at that in terms of the numbers. And they also comment, I think this is really

21:52.000 --> 21:57.520
 critical all across the board. It is not known how well these results will hold if or when some

21:57.520 --> 22:03.120
 of the newer variants of concern become prominent. So we're getting, we're getting, I think,

22:03.120 --> 22:09.520
 encouraging information, you know, which we expected about a lower risk of being infected

22:09.520 --> 22:14.080
 if you've been infected in the past. But unfortunately, the data we're seeing now is the

22:14.080 --> 22:19.600
 majority of infections now in the US are not with the original variant. They're with the new

22:19.600 --> 22:25.280
 variant. So we are in that world that was discussed here of newer variants. And that's the infections

22:25.280 --> 22:31.200
 we're seeing. It becomes a whole new question. We know the vaccines, we have better and better data

22:32.080 --> 22:38.640
 on vaccine efficacy against variants. We do not have as great data suggesting that people with

22:38.640 --> 22:45.280
 prior infection are going to fare well with the new variants. So I continue to recommend to my

22:45.280 --> 22:51.360
 patients who've been previously infected that they go ahead with the vaccine. Now this is going

22:51.360 --> 22:56.880
 to be a sort of a tricky one here. I didn't realize how complicated this was. But what do we as

22:56.880 --> 23:04.400
 clinicians do now when people come from overseas and they got some sort of vaccine outside the US?

23:04.400 --> 23:12.160
 How do we handle that? Well, fortunately, thanks, the CDC has given us a playbook on how to do this.

23:12.160 --> 23:18.720
 And if you go to the CDC, they have a section where they basically talk about what to do for

23:18.720 --> 23:24.800
 a person who received a COVID-19 vaccine outside the US. And they break this down into really, I'm

23:24.800 --> 23:29.840
 going to say three basic categories. But this is coming up. I get calls from clinicians all the

23:29.840 --> 23:35.440
 time. So I'm going to send them to this 12 and the answers will be here. But let's take a category

23:35.440 --> 23:42.800
 number one. This is a person who has received all the recommended doses of a COVID-19 vaccine

23:42.800 --> 23:50.640
 that is listed for emergency use by the WHO. What do we do? Nothing. We consider them vaccinated.

23:50.640 --> 23:56.000
 This is not just restricted to the FDA. Three that we have. These are any of those vaccines

23:56.000 --> 24:03.840
 on the WHO list, which I will go through scenario number two. The person has not gotten all the doses.

24:03.840 --> 24:11.040
 But they did start on one of these series of what's considered a WHO approved vaccine.

24:11.760 --> 24:16.960
 You go ahead in that case and just offer them to the opportunity to complete one of our FDA

24:16.960 --> 24:22.880
 authorized COVID-19 vaccine series. So let's hit a little scenarios here. Let's say they got a

24:22.880 --> 24:29.600
 Moderna, a Pfizer overseas. You can give them that second Moderna or Pfizer dose here in the US,

24:29.600 --> 24:35.840
 considered completed. What if they got an AstraZeneca overseas? You can then

24:36.480 --> 24:42.240
 give them a two dose of the mRNA or you can give them a J&J. So little subtlety there.

24:42.240 --> 24:48.320
 What if they received a vaccine that you've never heard of that is not on the WHO list? So

24:48.320 --> 24:53.360
 they come and they said, you know what? I got my CO vaccine, inactivated vaccine produced by

24:53.360 --> 25:00.160
 the biotech into India. What do you do? In that case, we just go ahead. We treat them as if they

25:00.160 --> 25:06.720
 were unvaccinated and we just recommend it going ahead with an FDA authorized COVID-19 vaccine series.

25:06.720 --> 25:14.000
 So those are our three scenarios here. A little subtlety. You want to wait at least 28 days after

25:14.000 --> 25:21.520
 that last dose of a vaccine that is not on the WHO list. And what are the current vaccines on

25:21.520 --> 25:28.880
 that list as of May 13th when it was last updated? That's their Pfizer BioNTech, the AstraZeneca,

25:28.880 --> 25:37.440
 the J&J, Moderna, Sinopharm, and Sinovac. Questions? Go to the CDC website. All right.

25:38.000 --> 25:43.200
 The period of detectable viral replication, the viral symptom phase, the time for monitoring

25:43.200 --> 25:47.360
 and monoclonals. And as I like to say, where you get your test is where you should be able to get

25:47.360 --> 25:54.960
 your monoclonals. So we had some exciting news. On June 4th, Regenera announced that the FDA

25:54.960 --> 26:03.440
 authorized lower 1,200 milligram intravenous and subcutaneous dose regen cove. So that's the

26:03.440 --> 26:11.360
 Casa Rivemab and the MDebemab antibody cocktail to treat patients with COVID-19. And it was the

26:11.360 --> 26:16.320
 subcutaneous part that got me the most excited because this means we can really start expanding

26:16.320 --> 26:22.080
 access to these impressive medications. I know a lot of the hospitals are going to sort of stick

26:22.080 --> 26:26.480
 with what they've got. A lot of them, I know in the New York area have switched over to Regeneron.

26:26.480 --> 26:30.560
 But this is potentially a chance for those urgent care, some of those primary care sites

26:31.280 --> 26:36.560
 to go ahead. It was a little bit harder than I wish it was. It is a smaller volume, but it's

26:36.560 --> 26:42.320
 still four shots. But that's a lot less than having to get something out of the freezer,

26:42.320 --> 26:50.560
 set up an IV. So I think that that's great. All right. So I'm going to throw a little story.

26:50.560 --> 26:56.800
 I'll call this missed opportunity. And this is this is a woman that we're currently taking care of.

26:56.800 --> 27:01.440
 I sort of alluded a woman in her late 50s, carrying a little bit of extra weight,

27:02.880 --> 27:08.080
 diabetes, just recently diagnosed with COVID. This is not the woman admitted this morning.

27:08.080 --> 27:14.720
 She was unvaccinated, sort of part of a group of individuals who are also unvaccinated. And that

27:14.720 --> 27:23.600
 was the exposure. At the time of diagnosis, monoclonals were not offered. And I think I told a little bit

27:23.600 --> 27:30.320
 about how this woman ended up doing poorly. So just kind of keep this in mind. She ended up saying,

27:30.320 --> 27:36.720
 like, I don't want to expose my family and ended up in the hospital. Unfortunately, now she's on

27:36.720 --> 27:43.280
 a ventilator. So just keep in mind, if you decide not to get vaccinated, you can still get monoclonals.

27:43.280 --> 27:49.200
 An article, Co-infections, secondary infections, and antimicrobial use in patients hospitalized

27:49.200 --> 28:00.160
 with COVID-19 during the first pandemic wave from the ISA-RIC WHO, CCP UK study. This is a multi-center

28:00.160 --> 28:06.400
 prospective cohort study published in the Lancet Microbe. And I have to say when I read this paper,

28:06.400 --> 28:18.720
 it made me sad. Really what they observed was that 85.2% of patients with COVID ended up receiving.

28:18.720 --> 28:24.720
 They did not require, but they ended up receiving one or more antimicrobials, antibiotics at some

28:24.720 --> 28:30.000
 point during their admission. And there was a lot of use of broad spectrum agents, a lot of use of

28:30.000 --> 28:35.200
 carbapenums, rather than the carbapenum sparing alternative. So really using those top shelf

28:35.200 --> 28:42.880
 restricted antibiotics in the context of a viral illness. All right, Ivermectin, yet another paper

28:42.880 --> 28:50.080
 on Ivermectin. And this one was published in the journal Viruses. And this was effects of a single

28:50.080 --> 28:57.200
 dose of Ivermectin on viral and clinical outcomes in asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects,

28:57.200 --> 29:04.880
 a pilot clinical trial in Lebanon. This was a randomized control trial conducted in 100 asymptomatic

29:04.880 --> 29:12.640
 subjects in Lebanon that had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, five days after having come in contact

29:12.640 --> 29:20.000
 with a suspected or positive case. So we really had good timing here. This is looking at early

29:20.000 --> 29:25.440
 treatment. The authors reported that at baseline, the two groups had similar viral loads as assessed

29:25.440 --> 29:35.760
 by CT values. So 15.13 versus 14.2. The treatment group received a single dose of Ivermectin. So

29:35.760 --> 29:43.520
 this is a single dose of Ivermectin adjusted by weight. They also received what is the standard

29:43.520 --> 29:50.080
 of care in Lebanon, which is zinc and vitamin C as well. And the authors reported two findings.

29:50.080 --> 29:55.840
 At 72 hours after the regimen was started, the increase in CT values was significantly higher

29:55.840 --> 30:03.280
 in the Ivermectin than the control group. So higher CT values, lower viral load. In the Ivermectin

30:03.280 --> 30:10.160
 group, the CT increased from 15 to 30 compared to the control group where it only went from 14

30:10.160 --> 30:19.200
 to 18.96. Moreover, more subjects in the control group developed symptoms. 6% of the control

30:19.200 --> 30:24.720
 population required hospitalization. Nobody in the Ivermectin treated group required hospitalization.

30:25.440 --> 30:31.760
 So I'm going to, I'm going to muse a little bit on this here. As, and people should listen to the

30:32.320 --> 30:40.880
 Twiv that came right before this big body airplane episode with David Fagan bomb. I mean, David,

30:40.880 --> 30:47.120
 David's great. David's another one of these like Paul, Paul, farmer type guys who just really what,

30:47.120 --> 30:53.440
 what a just amazing story of a man who has done so much with so many challenges. And he's really

30:53.440 --> 30:59.680
 said, listen, Ivermectin is something that we do not know the answer to. We have some studies that

30:59.680 --> 31:04.480
 are positive. We have some studies that are negative. We don't have enough data on Ivermectin where I

31:04.480 --> 31:09.760
 think it's reasonable to say that, oh my gosh, withholding Ivermectin is a crime against humanity,

31:09.760 --> 31:14.400
 a crime against humanity is that we have not done the really good trials that we need to do

31:14.400 --> 31:19.280
 to help us in this realm. So we're all fingers crossed that active six in addition to inhaled

31:19.280 --> 31:25.920
 steroids, fluvoxamine. Maybe Ivermectin will be in there because one of the issues is that people

31:25.920 --> 31:30.480
 are using this widely throughout the world, probably second only to hydroxychloroquine,

31:30.480 --> 31:36.480
 which unfortunately some people are still using and they should stop that. And we need to know

31:36.480 --> 31:41.360
 either way with a really good trial so that clinicians patients can make decisions about

31:41.360 --> 31:45.040
 whether or not this is something that should be included in the treatment.

31:45.680 --> 31:51.760
 All right, early inflammatory phase. Did we talk about aspirin before? Well, aspirin,

31:51.760 --> 31:58.960
 we finally got the recovery data on aspirin. And aspirin does not seem to be making a difference.

31:58.960 --> 32:04.880
 So the aspirin in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 recovery, a randomized control

32:04.880 --> 32:10.560
 open label platform trial. This was posted as a preprint. I think all our listeners are familiar

32:10.560 --> 32:17.120
 with the big UK recovery trial. Basically, end of the day, aspirin was not associated with

32:17.120 --> 32:23.200
 reduction in 28 day mortality or in the risk of progressing to invasive mechanical ventilation

32:23.200 --> 32:31.360
 or death. So this is basically 150 milligrams of aspirin once per day versus standard care without

32:31.360 --> 32:38.960
 that and not showing a benefit here. So I'm going to just close quickly with a mention of long COVID.

32:38.960 --> 32:44.720
 We're trying to find what are the centers of excellence. We're trying to establish some

32:44.720 --> 32:50.640
 definitions of what are excellent outcomes. So hopefully we can get patients, unfortunately,

32:50.640 --> 32:56.480
 a growing number of patients into those centers. And we are going to continue to support femuric.

32:57.040 --> 33:02.240
 So May, June and July, all donations made to parasites without borders will be doubled. We're

33:02.240 --> 33:08.800
 hoping to get up to $40,000 to support femuric. So thank you very much. Time for some emails

33:08.800 --> 33:16.560
 for Daniel. If you want to send one in, Daniel at microbe.tv. Patty writes any data and or I would

33:16.560 --> 33:21.840
 like to know your thoughts on the effectiveness of the Pfizer COVID vaccine on patients who receive

33:21.840 --> 33:30.640
 intravenous ocrevis to modulate multiple sclerosis symptoms. Okay, so I've actually gotten a lot

33:30.640 --> 33:36.400
 of questions. Actually, ocrevis is one of the one of the culprits that often triggers people to

33:36.400 --> 33:43.360
 reach out to me. And what is ocrevis for our listeners? So this is a B cell and plasma cell

33:43.360 --> 33:48.720
 depleting therapy. So this targets CD 20. So it's going to get rid of your B cells, your plasma

33:48.720 --> 33:53.840
 cells. Basically, you're going to get rid of those antibody producing cells really more of a B cell,

33:53.840 --> 33:59.120
 right? You're going to lose your CD 20 when you differentiate the plasma cells. But when someone

33:59.120 --> 34:06.800
 gets this, they have very few B cells, they get the vaccine. If you go ahead and check a anti spike

34:06.800 --> 34:13.120
 antibody serology, it's going to be negative. Just just to just to say, the B cells are not

34:13.120 --> 34:18.240
 there to make those antibodies. So you were relying on a T cell response. What about that T cell

34:18.240 --> 34:24.640
 response? I heard there's a T cell test, this T detected by adaptive. The way that that is set

34:24.640 --> 34:31.760
 up, the algorithm they use is good for detecting natural infection. It is not yet calibrated to

34:31.760 --> 34:37.760
 give us a T cell correlate of immunity. So when these individuals, blood testing is not going to

34:37.760 --> 34:42.960
 be helpful. We are concerned, right, that these people have gotten these therapies that they're

34:42.960 --> 34:48.160
 not getting the B cell serology response, we hope that we're just relying on T cells.

34:48.960 --> 34:53.680
 And we do not know the answer to this. There certainly are people out there giving extra doses

34:53.680 --> 34:59.200
 of vaccines. I think we need to study this just like everything else. What we are not seeing,

34:59.200 --> 35:03.360
 and I think this is reassuring, we are not seeing these patients ending up in the hospital, right?

35:03.360 --> 35:10.000
 I'm not seeing patients who got a crevice. I'm not seeing patients on methadrexate. I'm not seeing

35:10.000 --> 35:16.080
 lots of renal transplant or other transplant patients who got vaccinated ending up in the hospital. So

35:16.080 --> 35:22.400
 despite a lack of this serological support, we're not seeing the breakthrough that would be as

35:22.400 --> 35:27.920
 concerning as people might think in these populations. So I'm a bit reassured in these populations.

35:27.920 --> 35:32.080
 I'm also reassured that the level of the virus is going down. But what is the best way to protect

35:32.080 --> 35:36.960
 these individuals? It's for everyone else to get vaccinated. Christie from Seattle writes,

35:36.960 --> 35:41.840
 is it possible for the COVID vaccine Pfizer to cause an allergy such as cat grass, etc.

35:41.840 --> 35:46.480
 To develop a week after my partner got the second shot, he started getting itchy eyes and sneezing

35:46.480 --> 35:51.040
 around our cats that we've had for three years. Obviously, there are plenty of coincidental

35:51.040 --> 35:56.080
 conditions as you've talked about on the show, and there's still consequences far better than

35:56.080 --> 36:01.520
 getting COVID. If possible, why would this happen? Yeah, so this one, you're going to have trouble

36:01.520 --> 36:05.200
 doing much of a search on, right? Because everyone's all worried about the anaphylaxis.

36:06.720 --> 36:13.040
 I am not sure that there's a relationship here. This has been a particularly bad allergy season.

36:13.040 --> 36:17.040
 I have to say I never had allergies before this season. Oh my gosh, I just got COVID shots.

36:17.040 --> 36:21.200
 And maybe it's no, no, I'm joking. I don't think there's a connection here. I just think this

36:21.200 --> 36:27.200
 is a really bad allergy season. The world's in a slightly better place with how much carbon

36:27.200 --> 36:32.720
 mitigation, how much reduction in travel and the rest. We may just be seeing lots of things blooming.

36:33.280 --> 36:40.080
 The cat connection, I'm not sure. Joseph writes, in preparing for reopening a program for seniors,

36:40.080 --> 36:45.200
 I was asked by my wife to review their reopening policy. Their program provides continuing educational

36:45.200 --> 36:52.640
 and recreational programming for seniors. Their program will require COVID vaccination to attend

36:52.640 --> 36:57.280
 the program, the average age of the participants about 80 years old. Given their age, the possible

36:57.280 --> 37:01.600
 high risk medical conditions of these seniors, would you still recommend that the staff and

37:01.600 --> 37:06.960
 participants still mask after vaccination? Yeah, this is a tough one. We've really doubled

37:06.960 --> 37:11.520
 down on boy, those vaccines really make a big difference. But I think that you've got to make

37:11.520 --> 37:15.840
 individual decisions here. If you're over 80, if you have a number of medical problems,

37:15.840 --> 37:21.120
 I think we've talked about people on different medications. That's when if you feel comfortable

37:21.120 --> 37:27.280
 continuing to wear a mask, it is a reasonable thing to do. We're still not through this pandemic.

37:28.000 --> 37:34.080
 We're only learning about the impact of the vaccines on different variants. Everyone is unique,

37:34.080 --> 37:38.720
 as far as their ability to respond to the vaccines, particularly once they get above the age of 80.

37:38.720 --> 37:45.520
 So I see no problem continuing with masks. I point out when I go to the gym, I am a robust

37:45.520 --> 37:50.400
 healthy individual on no medications with no medical problems in my 50s. I still wear a mask.

37:51.040 --> 37:54.160
 I don't think there's a problem with continuing to have extra levels of safety.

37:54.160 --> 37:59.600
 And from Stacy, I'm a psychologist in private practice. I have several patients prescribed

37:59.600 --> 38:06.720
 either atypical antipsychotics or neuroleptic antipsychotic medication for bipolar disorder,

38:06.720 --> 38:11.440
 schizoaffective disorder, borderline personality disorder, and schizophrenia. Their medications

38:11.440 --> 38:18.240
 include lithium, clopazine, olanzapine, lemotrigine. Many have expressed concerns about possible

38:18.240 --> 38:22.560
 negative interactions between the COVID vaccine and their psychiatric medication.

38:22.560 --> 38:27.760
 Several concerns relate to possible toxicity, decrease in efficacy of psychotropics and side

38:27.760 --> 38:31.920
 effects. One patient mentioned a fear about the COVID vaccine causing a drop in white blood cells.

38:31.920 --> 38:37.040
 I would like to know if there is any evidence to suggest patients on psychotropic medication

38:37.040 --> 38:42.560
 should not get vaccinated, and or what resources, research, etc. are available that I can access

38:42.560 --> 38:47.120
 to help assure my folks that all the COVID vaccines are safe and effective for individuals

38:47.120 --> 38:52.640
 with serious mental illness. Yeah, so I'm going to say you can feel very reassured here.

38:53.920 --> 38:59.360
 There's a very robust reporting system, right? Hundreds of millions, over 300 million doses of

38:59.360 --> 39:03.520
 COVID vaccines have been given in the United States. We have a robust reporting system.

39:04.160 --> 39:07.840
 Any of the concerns, you hear about them. You hear about them in the popular press.

39:08.880 --> 39:15.280
 We are really good at watching for these things. We are not seeing any issues in this population,

39:15.280 --> 39:20.000
 not seeing any issues with these medications. If there's an issue, we're going to hear about it.

39:20.000 --> 39:25.840
 Even if it's something as rare and one in 10 or 20,000, boom, we're going to see that come up on our

39:25.840 --> 39:31.840
 adverse reporting systems. I'm going to say very comfortably that this is a safe thing to do.

39:31.840 --> 39:35.600
 Being vaccinated is so much safer than not being vaccinated for these individuals.

39:35.600 --> 39:41.600
 That's COVID-19 clinical update number 66 with Dr. Daniel Griffin. Thank you, Daniel.

39:41.600 --> 39:55.440
 Oh, thank you so much, and everyone be safe.
