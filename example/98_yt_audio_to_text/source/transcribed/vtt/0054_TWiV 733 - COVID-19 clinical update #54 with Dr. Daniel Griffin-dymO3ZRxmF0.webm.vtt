 This week in virology, the podcast about viruses, the kind that make you sick.

00:10.240 --> 00:21.040
 From Microbe TV, this is Twiv, this week in virology, Episode 733, recorded on March 18, 2021.

00:21.680 --> 00:27.760
 I'm Vincent Draconiello, and you're listening to the podcast All About Viruses. Joining me

00:27.760 --> 00:37.360
 today from New York, Daniel Griffin. Hello, everyone. This is clinical update number 54.

00:37.360 --> 00:43.840
 How's things going, Daniel? You know, I continue to be optimistic. You know, as I was saying the

00:43.840 --> 00:49.200
 other day, you know, that we've said over time, it's, you know, it's a race, the vaccine against

00:49.200 --> 00:54.240
 the virus, but, you know, that the governors are doing everything they can to help out the virus,

00:54.240 --> 01:02.160
 right? So we are doing everything we can to ramp up the vaccinations. And I actually don't have

01:02.160 --> 01:08.640
 people heard, but there have already been over a hundred million vaccine doses given out in the

01:08.640 --> 01:14.080
 United States. We haven't quite got to 100 million people fully vaccinated, but we are cranking through

01:14.080 --> 01:20.160
 the vaccines. I know a lot of our listeners, I don't know what percent at this point, are here

01:20.160 --> 01:25.280
 on Long Island. Long Island has been a little bit of a vaccine desert, I have to say, but

01:25.920 --> 01:31.440
 when this drops on Saturday on Friday, three mass vaccination sites will open on Long Island. So

01:32.160 --> 01:39.200
 exciting stuff for getting getting people a lot more chance to get vaccinated. But I'm sort of

01:39.200 --> 01:43.760
 jumping into my sit rep before my quote, but that's okay. We'll get to the quotation. We're sort of

01:43.760 --> 01:49.600
 sitting on this plateau. And as I'll discuss a little bit later, what we're seeing as far as cases,

01:49.600 --> 01:55.600
 we're seeing a disproportionate number of these in the younger population, so in kids. So we'll

01:55.600 --> 02:02.160
 make sure we discuss that. But let's start with our quotation. And this is again, Eleanor Roosevelt.

02:03.120 --> 02:09.600
 Great minds discuss ideas, average minds discuss events, small minds discuss

02:09.600 --> 02:14.560
 people. And the reason I throw it out there, my whole hope is as we come out of this,

02:14.560 --> 02:21.200
 that we learn what went wrong. And we learn what to do so that this never happens again.

02:21.920 --> 02:26.720
 And I know a lot of the discussion is about people who did what wrong. I don't think we

02:26.720 --> 02:32.800
 learn from that. Those people will probably not be here the next time around. But the lessons

02:32.800 --> 02:38.560
 will be there. The events will be there. The ideas about how we can do better the next time. So

02:38.560 --> 02:44.880
 I just want to throw that out there. I really do hope we learn from this. I do hope it doesn't

02:44.880 --> 02:50.480
 become about just about blame and take the focus off the fact that this was a horrible thing that

02:50.480 --> 02:55.920
 happened. This still is a horrible thing that is happening. But we can respond better the next time

02:55.920 --> 03:03.440
 I do hope. So never miss an opportunity to vaccinate. Never miss an opportunity to test and never waste

03:03.440 --> 03:12.320
 a vaccine dose. So as I mentioned, we're here on this plateau. Our plateau in New York is not

03:12.320 --> 03:18.080
 as low a plateau as I would like. So we're sort of going against this with our vaccines.

03:18.800 --> 03:25.360
 But as I mentioned, children and COVID, this has become a very hot topic. And the hottest topic

03:25.360 --> 03:32.240
 I think this last week is three feet versus six feet. And I know I heard one of the physicians,

03:32.240 --> 03:38.480
 scientists who was sort of discussing this saying, oh, this is just a distractor. But let me actually

03:38.480 --> 03:42.960
 go into the weeds in this because I actually want to say that my involvement with schools,

03:42.960 --> 03:47.520
 camps, different venues to get children sort of back into more of a normal situation.

03:48.480 --> 03:55.520
 This actually is a critical issue. So what got this all being discussed? And there was a publication

03:55.520 --> 04:03.120
 Effectiveness of three versus six feet of physical distancing for controlling spread of COVID-19

04:03.120 --> 04:09.600
 among primary and secondary students and staff, a retrospective statewide cohort study. And this

04:09.600 --> 04:16.720
 was published in CID. So one of the things I am going to say as I go through this is I do want

04:16.720 --> 04:23.200
 our listeners as painful as it is to try to actually read this article. Because the headlines,

04:23.200 --> 04:29.520
 I do not think really match with what's in this article. So let me discuss a little bit about

04:30.480 --> 04:41.600
 what this article contained. So they reported on 251 eligible school districts. So 537,336

04:41.600 --> 04:50.480
 students and 99,390 staff who attended in-person instruction during a 16-week period. And they

04:50.480 --> 04:57.280
 gave us incidence rate ratios with confidence intervals. Now I'm going to focus on the students

04:57.280 --> 05:03.600
 and not the staff, but there is data there on the staff. So they reported, this is sort of their

05:03.600 --> 05:10.560
 conclusion, that student case rates were similar in the 242 districts with greater than three feet

05:10.560 --> 05:17.520
 versus greater than six feet of physical distancing between the students. And they give us an IRR,

05:17.520 --> 05:26.560
 an incident rate ratio of 0.891 with a really wide confidence interval. And the results were

05:26.560 --> 05:35.120
 similar after they adjusted for community incidents. That came in 0.904 with, again, a wide confidence

05:35.120 --> 05:41.840
 interval stretching from 0.6 all the way up to 1.325. And they concluded that they did not see any

05:41.840 --> 05:50.800
 significant difference in the staff incident rate ratios. And also, as they say here with

05:50.800 --> 05:55.280
 these wide confidence intervals, they couldn't show that there was any significant benefit to

05:55.280 --> 06:01.200
 six feet versus three feet. Now let's go a little bit into this, because I think this paper will

06:01.200 --> 06:06.080
 impact policy. So therefore, I think it's important that we spend a little time understanding how

06:06.080 --> 06:12.880
 reliable this data is. So first off, this is not any kind of a prospective control trial,

06:12.880 --> 06:20.720
 but rather was a retrospective analysis of publicly available data derived from case reporting to

06:20.720 --> 06:28.000
 the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education. And they looked at publicly

06:28.000 --> 06:33.280
 available district plans. I want to make the point here. This wasn't even an observational study.

06:33.280 --> 06:37.760
 They actually didn't even go out and observe to see what was going on. They basically looked at

06:37.760 --> 06:42.080
 what were the published plans. There was no verification what was actually going on.

06:42.800 --> 06:47.440
 They just looked through the plans, and then they looked at some publicly reported

06:47.440 --> 06:53.120
 case rates. So they looked and they said, OK, districts that permitted a minimum of greater than

06:53.520 --> 06:59.600
 three feet in distancing, even if greater distances were preferred, they're going to classify them as

06:59.600 --> 07:07.120
 the three feet group. Districts that allowed greater than three for some grades, but not all.

07:07.120 --> 07:12.560
 Those were all classified as greater than three. Now, schools, the only ones that were greater

07:12.560 --> 07:17.920
 than six schools that open in hybrid learning mode with requirements of greater than six feet

07:17.920 --> 07:23.840
 in the hybrid model were classified as the greater than six feet physical distancing.

07:23.840 --> 07:31.280
 Then what they tell us is of these over 500,000 students, they identified 4,226 cases.

07:31.280 --> 07:37.680
 So of all these students, we are seeing reported positive cases to the Department

07:38.720 --> 07:42.480
 of Health, based Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education

07:43.920 --> 07:49.440
 that they had a case rate of 0.8%, right? So this is a very small number.

07:49.440 --> 07:54.160
 A couple of things to also add. The majority of the campuses that did open had less than

07:54.160 --> 07:59.600
 80% of enrolled students on campus. They do comment on the fact that active surveillance

07:59.600 --> 08:05.360
 was rare, right? So we have to throw in what we learned from last time that the majority of cases

08:06.000 --> 08:13.040
 in this age group are missed. They also lumped all the schools together and based their analysis

08:13.040 --> 08:18.160
 on, as I mentioned, publicly available plans. There was no verification of what was the actual

08:18.160 --> 08:26.160
 practice. And then what they saw was this rate ratio of 0.9% for six feet over three,

08:26.160 --> 08:32.800
 but this really wide confidence interval. So I think the tough thing I had with this paper was,

08:32.800 --> 08:38.080
 this falls into what I say of things that we want to be true or don't want to be true.

08:38.800 --> 08:42.880
 And I don't think that there was anything here in the data that really gave us clarity on this

08:42.880 --> 08:50.320
 issue. So what I did want to do was sort of bring people back to, I think, a paper that actually

08:50.320 --> 08:55.200
 was a little bit better at giving us insight. What I looked at this paper and I said,

08:55.200 --> 09:00.000
 people now want to say that we need three feet or three feet is fine compared to six feet.

09:00.000 --> 09:05.920
 And the reason there's so much focus here is that most schools in our country,

09:05.920 --> 09:11.200
 if six foot separation is required between the students, between the desks, that's going to

09:11.200 --> 09:17.600
 prevent them from a full in-person opening, a sort of return to this full in-person class.

09:18.320 --> 09:22.720
 So there really was, I want to say, sorry to the authors of that paper,

09:22.720 --> 09:28.320
 but there was an excellent paper published in the Lancet back in June. And I think we've spent

09:28.320 --> 09:33.200
 some time on this before, but I want to sort of bring people back to it. It's amazing that

09:33.200 --> 09:39.200
 something in June is old news, but physical distancing, face masks, and eye protection to

09:39.200 --> 09:46.640
 prevent person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, a systematic review and meta-analysis,

09:46.640 --> 09:52.240
 right? So this was back in the Lancet. And the point this paper made, which is really something

09:52.240 --> 09:57.440
 consistent with what we've learned over the years, is that there's a continuum to risk.

09:57.440 --> 10:04.160
 There's no invisible barrier at six feet or at three feet. I still remember having a discussion

10:04.160 --> 10:09.360
 with, I think it was a reporter back in April who really wanted to be within three feet of our

10:09.360 --> 10:16.720
 friends, and six feet seemed excessive. Now in medicine, we talk about droplets, we talk about

10:16.720 --> 10:22.400
 aerosols, we've looked at diseases like measles and laryngeal tuberculosis, where really an infected

10:22.400 --> 10:26.960
 person comes into the office waiting room minutes later, just about every susceptible person is

10:26.960 --> 10:34.240
 infected. Now influenza, in contrast, where a mask, distance, good ventilation really makes

10:34.240 --> 10:41.040
 sitting across the room a much lower risk activity, right? And I know there was a lot of time spent,

10:41.040 --> 10:47.120
 you know, is it airborne? What is an aerosol? You know, and I think we need to be careful of sort

10:47.120 --> 10:52.960
 of getting mired down in the medical terminology. And I think there were in some quarters, and

10:52.960 --> 10:58.320
 there still actually continues to be in many quarters, challenges with science communication

10:58.320 --> 11:04.720
 around this issue. We've talked about larger droplets, which in some situations, in some

11:04.720 --> 11:08.880
 percent of them will travel more than six feet, so they don't all drop magically.

11:10.560 --> 11:16.160
 And some some virions, infectious virus particles, to use that as it's supposed to properly be used,

11:16.160 --> 11:22.320
 I understand, they can actually be in those smaller size droplets. So nothing is black and white

11:22.320 --> 11:28.080
 here. There are continuums here. But I think this translates into the fact that if you have poor

11:28.080 --> 11:36.160
 ventilation, the law of averages is such that a small percentage of these smaller size particles

11:36.160 --> 11:41.680
 that might have virions in them are going to start to build up in a room. So if you go back to this

11:41.680 --> 11:46.800
 paper, and I'm going to say, you know, not all you're driving, but this was a good read, you can

11:46.800 --> 11:52.640
 actually really see a beautiful figure where they show that the absolute risk really does drop in

11:52.640 --> 12:01.360
 that first meter. So that 3.3 feet by about 80%. But then if you get out to about three meters,

12:01.360 --> 12:06.000
 you're seeing you're getting down to about a 90% reduction. So you can see you get the most

12:06.000 --> 12:11.680
 bang in that first meter, but you get even more in that second meter. So it's a continuum. We've

12:11.680 --> 12:17.920
 talked before about how a mask drops our risk by about 80, 85%. We've talked about eye protection

12:17.920 --> 12:24.800
 being associated with another drop in risk. And I know this study in Lancet didn't really spend

12:24.800 --> 12:30.720
 much time on proper ventilation, but I think we can add that into the mix. So I think as we hear

12:30.720 --> 12:38.400
 that the CDC is continuing 3 feet versus considering 3 feet versus 6 feet, what's really being considered

12:38.400 --> 12:45.840
 is a full plan. If you have masks, if you have 3 feet, if maybe you put up plexiglass barriers,

12:45.840 --> 12:51.520
 if you upgrade your ventilation system or have open windows, putting also into the equation

12:51.520 --> 12:58.000
 community prevalence, we do know that schools, we think we know that we don't have a lot of

12:58.000 --> 13:04.000
 actors surveillance that schools can be opened safely. We also know they can be kept closed and

13:04.000 --> 13:09.040
 we also know they can be opened unsafely. So I think as we get into this decision, it's important

13:09.040 --> 13:14.480
 to look at the science and balance our risks. And as we get into our tail end about long COVID,

13:14.480 --> 13:18.240
 I'm going to be talking a little bit about long COVID in children again,

13:18.240 --> 13:22.000
 because this is getting more attention and we're getting more stories about what's happening there.

13:22.880 --> 13:28.880
 All right, let's move into testing. Testing is sort of a short section. I'm sort of

13:28.880 --> 13:35.520
 a little bit dismayed at the drop in the amount of testing that is going on. If you actually go

13:35.520 --> 13:40.640
 to these mass vaccination sites and you start asking the volunteers and the people working there,

13:40.640 --> 13:45.600
 hey, what were you doing before you came and started working here, a lot of them were involved

13:45.600 --> 13:53.280
 in the mass testing sites. So we're seeing a shift of resources, a shift of focus, a shift of energy

13:53.280 --> 13:59.920
 from testing to vaccinations. And we still, if you look around, we're at a higher level now than we

13:59.920 --> 14:04.880
 were during the quote unquote second peak of the summer in a lot of parts of our country. So

14:04.880 --> 14:10.080
 we really have to continue having testing as part of our approach. And there really was a lot of

14:10.080 --> 14:14.560
 money in that last plan that just came out to have testing as part of an approach. So

14:15.280 --> 14:20.000
 there's been a lot of good work done on this. We actually did some like to think it was good work.

14:20.000 --> 14:25.360
 It's now published. I'll have to tweet that out to everyone. But you can actually look at cases

14:25.360 --> 14:29.840
 prevented, how much does it cost per case prevented, and particularly if someone else is paying for

14:29.840 --> 14:33.920
 those testing bills, which is now what's supposed to be happening with this new stimulus bill,

14:33.920 --> 14:40.320
 we can make testing part of a safe reopening plan. Active vaccination. We actually saw really

14:40.320 --> 14:46.160
 encouraging data. And this was a big discussion before. If you're going to approach a disease

14:46.160 --> 14:51.680
 with a double dose vaccination strategy, how many of those people are really going to come back

14:51.680 --> 14:59.440
 for that second dose. So we saw a bit of information from the CDC and the MMWR COVID-19 vaccine,

14:59.440 --> 15:05.520
 second dose completion, and interval between first and second doses among vaccinated persons,

15:05.520 --> 15:16.480
 United States, December 14, 2020, February 14, 2021. And this was impressive. As per the CDC data,

15:16.480 --> 15:23.680
 only about 3% of individuals are reported as missing that second dose. So this is, I have to

15:23.680 --> 15:29.360
 say, very encouraging. This may even be, I'm going to venture to say even an overestimation,

15:29.360 --> 15:33.680
 because we know a lot of individuals, maybe they went down to Florida, got that first dose,

15:33.680 --> 15:37.760
 and then they came up to Massachusetts to complete their series, is the track and

15:37.760 --> 15:43.040
 good enough to catch that they really got that second dose. What we're seeing, I think, is a

15:43.040 --> 15:48.480
 really good uptake of people who get that first dose getting that second dose. So I have to say,

15:48.480 --> 15:53.520
 this is really encouraging. The other thing I want to throw in here is something that we're

15:53.520 --> 15:59.360
 getting more and more information about. We're hearing more and more confirmatory experiences

15:59.360 --> 16:08.320
 of people with long COVID, go ahead, get vaccinated, and actually feel significantly better.

16:09.360 --> 16:14.080
 This is something I started to notice early and early in January. I was a little bit worried,

16:14.080 --> 16:18.960
 is this going to hold after that second dose? After the second dose, it's holding, which is

16:18.960 --> 16:24.480
 pretty impressive. Say, my personal experience is probably about 30 or 40% of my patients.

16:24.480 --> 16:32.320
 My wife was just asking me, is it still holding? And of course, today, I got a call from one of my

16:32.320 --> 16:40.960
 patients who works in education, really a lot of difficulties, including, well, really, almost

16:40.960 --> 16:49.840
 anything. She seems the hair loss, the fatigue, pretty significant cognitive issues, the brain fog,

16:49.840 --> 16:55.840
 really concerned about her ability to function. Today, the call was just about a rash. And she

16:55.840 --> 17:01.440
 said, boy, I really am continuing to improve. I'm continuing to feel better. So this is really

17:01.440 --> 17:08.080
 exciting. We'll get maybe a little bit more ideas into why this is happening. We have a couple

17:08.080 --> 17:14.320
 theories out there we don't know. But that is definitely exciting to see vaccine as therapeutic.

17:14.320 --> 17:19.680
 We also have vaccine trials in children, and they're all up, they're getting filled, they're

17:19.680 --> 17:25.920
 running forward. We actually heard that some of the vaccine trials are looking at going as low as

17:25.920 --> 17:33.600
 children, as young, as six months of age. And this is fantastic. I think we've talked about,

17:33.600 --> 17:40.960
 you know, will we ever reach this herd immunity? If we don't have vaccinations in our children,

17:40.960 --> 17:45.840
 then it's going to be pretty challenging unless Peter Hotez wins over the hearts and minds of

17:45.840 --> 17:53.360
 every single adult. Passive vaccination. This was an exciting, complicated,

17:53.360 --> 17:58.480
 challenging last week, I have to say. So this last week, the US Department of Health and Human

17:58.480 --> 18:05.920
 Services said it would limit distribution of BAM, linibimab, monotherapy, in a few of our states,

18:05.920 --> 18:12.960
 California, Nevada, Arizona. And this was due to high levels of variants, hate those variants,

18:13.600 --> 18:20.400
 that contained L452R, right? So they've got a mutation that seems to be impacting the efficacy

18:20.400 --> 18:28.960
 of BAM linibimab, wanting us to switch over to cocktail treatment. Not only have we started to do

18:28.960 --> 18:35.440
 that in those three states, but we've switched over almost all our sites, I have to say here in

18:35.440 --> 18:40.000
 the tri-state area. So by the time this drops on Saturday, I think almost all the sites will

18:40.000 --> 18:47.920
 successfully switch over. You know, in research, all our home infusion, we are rapidly switching

18:47.920 --> 18:52.480
 everything over to cocktails. And I think I'll sort of explain, like, why are we doing that?

18:52.480 --> 18:58.960
 Why not just these three or four states? We do not have the level of surveillance of the genetic

18:58.960 --> 19:06.640
 sequence of the virus. So it was actually on a call to name Volta, who's my boss, at Optum Labs

19:06.640 --> 19:11.520
 and Health Group. And she said, Daniel, you know, if your mother was in one of these states that

19:11.520 --> 19:16.480
 does not have good surveillance, and she got COVID, would you want to give her the monotherapy,

19:16.480 --> 19:20.640
 or would you want to give her the cocktail? And, you know, so we'll call that the mother test.

19:20.640 --> 19:25.360
 And the mother test was, no, I would want my mother to get the cocktail. I think everyone

19:25.360 --> 19:31.120
 should get the cocktail. Clearly, and David Ho sort of heads up about this, we're seeing

19:31.760 --> 19:36.880
 the sequences in New York City, maybe a third or more. And that's actually from March 10th

19:36.880 --> 19:42.400
 when he emailed me. We're already having resistance mutations that would suggest a lack of efficacy

19:42.400 --> 19:49.120
 to bambling of a map. And we're seeing increasing rates around. So it's really a switch over to

19:49.120 --> 19:54.960
 cocktails. We're going to go even a little more detail here, right, is the ID Society of America

19:54.960 --> 20:02.320
 has now embraced monoclonal antibody therapy. But what have they embraced? It's very specific.

20:02.320 --> 20:09.200
 They've embraced therapy with Eli Lilly cocktail, with bamlinivumab and a test of a map based upon

20:09.200 --> 20:16.320
 those phase three trial results showing 87% reduction in progression, and that impact on

20:16.320 --> 20:21.120
 mortality as well. So this last week was a challenge, right? Because the Catholic hospitals were the

20:21.120 --> 20:26.480
 first ones to have cocktails. So we were flooding them. We had some pretty bad experiences with

20:26.480 --> 20:32.080
 people waiting six, seven hours, sort of a monoclonal antibody line to get the cocktails,

20:32.080 --> 20:37.040
 because we were not wanting them to get monotherapy with bam bam until everyone had switched over

20:37.040 --> 20:41.680
 to cocktails. So fortunately, I think we are by the time this drops, we will have made the

20:41.680 --> 20:47.440
 conversion across all over the place. So sort of tip my hat to everyone, sort of switching and

20:47.440 --> 20:54.720
 doing what needed to be done to make this happen. All right. And now this is, I'm going to hopefully

20:54.720 --> 21:00.000
 make this not as long as my other ones. We're going to spend a little bit of time on the tail

21:00.000 --> 21:06.640
 phase before we go into our fundraiser and answer some emails. So I mentioned recently that things

21:06.640 --> 21:11.440
 have been getting better and better with vaccination. But one of the things that has not been

21:11.440 --> 21:18.240
 getting better is we're seeing lots and lots of COVID positive kits. And now what's getting a

21:18.240 --> 21:23.360
 lot of attention is not just what we heard from the UK in terms of numbers, but we're hearing more

21:23.360 --> 21:29.520
 and more stories. We're hearing more and more focus on children getting COVID and then not getting

21:29.520 --> 21:34.480
 better. We don't know the exact percentages. I think I mentioned before, I don't want to hang

21:34.480 --> 21:41.120
 my hat yet on what percent of children at what age end up with long COVID. But it is clearly

21:41.120 --> 21:47.280
 more than we want to get long COVID. And the number of stories, the number of experiences

21:47.280 --> 21:52.000
 that are being shared are growing. So this is going to have to factor into that discussion.

21:52.560 --> 21:56.800
 I don't want to oversell this. I want to try to basically say this is what the science is.

21:57.680 --> 22:03.280
 We know that children are at low risk of hospitalization. We know that children at low risk of death.

22:03.280 --> 22:09.840
 We know that children are at lower risk seemingly for long COVID. But though children are at lower

22:09.840 --> 22:15.920
 risk, they're not at no risk. So as we learn more and more about this, I think this needs to be

22:15.920 --> 22:20.560
 part of that decision about letting the kids go back to school, letting the kids get back

22:20.560 --> 22:25.440
 into all these activities, just realizing that you can't just say, oh, it doesn't matter if a child

22:25.440 --> 22:31.680
 gets COVID because there can be consequences. So all right, as promised, I didn't keep people

22:31.680 --> 22:38.160
 too long. But I do want to bring people to sort of my vision that I am concerned about.

22:38.160 --> 22:42.880
 So I'm going to encourage everyone to go to parasiteswithoutporters.com and help us

22:42.880 --> 22:47.920
 continue to support the American Society of Tropical Medicine. We're trying to create these

22:47.920 --> 22:54.320
 scholarships, these annual meeting travel awards, for we're hoping to bring three women

22:55.200 --> 23:00.480
 from economically challenged parts of the world to the annual meeting, trying to sort of help

23:00.480 --> 23:05.760
 push them forward. I think it's really critical that we don't leave the rest of the world behind.

23:05.760 --> 23:12.320
 What I fear is this sort of dystopian vision I have. It's December 4th, it's July 4th.

23:12.960 --> 23:18.880
 We're celebrating Independence Day in the United States. We have massive numbers of people vaccinated.

23:19.440 --> 23:24.640
 We're having our small gathering barbecues in the backyard, but still thousands of people

23:24.640 --> 23:30.800
 are dying per day in many other parts of the world. So as we move, I think at a really good

23:30.800 --> 23:37.520
 pace here towards vaccinating people here in the United States. I am glad to hear that we already

23:37.520 --> 23:43.840
 have plans as we vaccinate people here to share those vaccines, to get those vaccines out to the

23:43.840 --> 23:50.400
 rest of the world. So let's not just worry about ourselves. We're not safe until everyone's safe.

23:50.400 --> 23:56.960
 Looking forward to understanding Daniel, how vaccinating resolves long COVID. That's a surprise

23:56.960 --> 24:07.760
 to me. Email for Daniel, Daniel at microbe.tv. Martha, question regarding age and COVID vaccine

24:07.760 --> 24:12.000
 dose. Does it seem that the elderly might need a larger dose than younger? If so, do you know of

24:12.000 --> 24:18.160
 any plans to test this? Similarly, should younger people get a smaller dose? My elderly father has

24:18.160 --> 24:24.560
 been asking about this. We'd love to find out the current thinking. It's always shocked me in

24:24.560 --> 24:29.840
 medicine. This is the difference between the pediatrician and the adult physician. Once you

24:29.840 --> 24:37.920
 turn 18, one size fits all. You could be that 75 pound woman. You could be the 320 pound

24:39.680 --> 24:46.640
 man or woman, I guess. It's really amazing to me that we don't individualize that we haven't

24:46.640 --> 24:52.320
 studied a lot of our medicines to really adjust. Some of them we have right now that we're using

24:52.320 --> 24:59.600
 tosyllism for people that escalate. We clearly use a weight-based dosing. For our anticoagulation,

24:59.600 --> 25:05.520
 we use a weight-based dosing. When we're looking at some of our antibiotics, we're actually looking

25:05.520 --> 25:09.760
 at how much an individual weighs and we're dosing how many milligrams per kilogram.

25:10.400 --> 25:14.800
 Most of our vaccines are one size fits all and the idea is we're going to overdose.

25:15.360 --> 25:20.320
 But then we end up with discussions about vaccines. Oh, they work better in the young.

25:20.320 --> 25:26.720
 They're less responsive in the older individuals. But we already saw with flu shots, for instance,

25:26.720 --> 25:33.120
 maybe adjusting the preparation or the amount actually results in more protection.

25:33.920 --> 25:39.840
 I think that's a lesson we've learned from the influenza vaccine story that it is worth looking

25:39.840 --> 25:46.960
 at different doses, different formulations, definitely based upon a person's age, but also

25:46.960 --> 25:53.120
 based maybe upon a person's size if we think about it. And I think that as we're more interested,

25:53.120 --> 25:58.640
 more exciting of vaccines, I'm hoping we learn more about this. I actually remember one of our

25:58.640 --> 26:04.240
 discussions when I was having my PhD was about really the difference in the immune system and

26:04.240 --> 26:12.160
 the vaccine efficacy in children versus the elderly versus people in sort of between the two.

26:12.160 --> 26:18.240
 And I'm supposed to say elderly or older individuals. But no, I think this is an excellent question,

26:18.240 --> 26:24.800
 and these are unanswered questions. And if we keep seeing maybe treatment vaccine failures in

26:24.800 --> 26:30.080
 people who are older, it might make sense to actually use increased doses in those individuals and

26:30.080 --> 26:35.360
 study that. Walter writes, is there any known downside to any of the anti-sars COVID-2 spike

26:35.360 --> 26:42.080
 protein vaccines for older kidney patients who do not yet require dialysis? I imagine vaccination

26:42.080 --> 26:48.240
 produces at least some antibodies against the ACE2 spike protein complex that could engender

26:48.240 --> 26:53.280
 cross reactivity against ACE2 receptors, the heart kidney and lungs are rich in those.

26:53.280 --> 26:59.280
 I noticed that kidney patients were not included in the original Pfizer biotech or Moderna vaccine

26:59.280 --> 27:06.080
 trials and have wondered why. Yeah, they weren't. That's a good observation. They have been clearly

27:06.080 --> 27:11.360
 included in the millions of people that are now being vaccinated. So we have good experience

27:11.360 --> 27:16.160
 in this population. They tend to be tolerating the vaccines very well. We're not seeing any

27:16.160 --> 27:21.280
 safety concerns. So if someone has kidney problems, even if they're on dialysis, we're not seeing

27:21.280 --> 27:27.760
 concerns. So dialysis, no dialysis. If you've got a place to get that vaccine, go ahead and get that

27:27.760 --> 27:32.160
 vaccine. All right, one more from Thomas. Our facilities are beginning to revisit policies for

27:32.160 --> 27:38.480
 pre-operative SARS-CoV-2 testing, as well as reconsidering wait times in our ORs after aerosol

27:38.480 --> 27:44.240
 generating procedures. For roughly the last year, we've been testing all our elective surgical

27:44.240 --> 27:49.840
 patients within 72 hours of their procedures and asking them to isolate following their testing

27:49.840 --> 27:55.200
 until day of surgery to reduce both the risks associated with an infected patient coming to

27:55.200 --> 28:00.080
 this hospital surgery center and spreading SARS-CoV-2 and more importantly, the risks of increasing

28:00.080 --> 28:07.200
 complications with a patient to have pre-op COVID-19, perioperative. Additionally, we have had

28:07.200 --> 28:12.480
 various wait times after both intubation, extubation or other aerosolizing procedures,

28:12.480 --> 28:18.960
 depending on air exchange rates. Proposals are to one, eliminate pre-op testing in fully vaccinated

28:18.960 --> 28:24.480
 patients to decrease or eliminate wait times after AGPs of patients are either vaccinated or have

28:24.480 --> 28:29.680
 tested negative. The latter certainly goes against our current practice. Since all elective cases

28:29.680 --> 28:33.760
 for the last many months would have had negative pre-op tests and we currently do wait for the

28:33.760 --> 28:38.640
 requisite number of air exchanges prior to opening the rooms up. The vast majority of the staff has

28:38.640 --> 28:43.360
 been fully vaccinated since early to mid-February, so risk of serious disease in our staff shouldn't

28:43.360 --> 28:48.480
 really be the concern. Since some facilities have 14-minute pre and post wait, you can imagine

28:48.480 --> 28:54.000
 efficiency isn't what it was pre-pandemic. Admittedly, item one goes against your mantra

28:54.000 --> 28:59.840
 never miss an opportunity to test, but I suspect the risks are at least markedly reduced. Given

28:59.840 --> 29:05.680
 the current CDC recommendations regarding travel for vaccinated people, it sounds like data still

29:05.680 --> 29:11.920
 lacking to definitively be say vaccinated individuals can't transmit to other people. Curious if you

29:11.920 --> 29:16.160
 and your crew have any thoughts on these proposed changes. Do you have any thoughts on if there

29:16.160 --> 29:24.400
 is an ideal time to schedule a COVID-19 vaccination either before or after a planned elective surgery?

29:24.400 --> 29:30.240
 We have administrators and high proclaiming patients shouldn't receive a vaccination for 14 days before

29:30.240 --> 29:35.280
 or after the scheduled surgery. I've heard surgeons proclaim you could get a fever from the vaccine

29:35.280 --> 29:40.320
 and might mimic a surgical side infection. And similarly, others have worried about side effects

29:40.320 --> 29:45.280
 mimicking COVID and leading to postponement. I tend to err on the side of never miss an

29:45.280 --> 29:49.760
 opportunity to vaccinate. So that was a lot there. That was like a that was like a

29:49.760 --> 29:58.560
 Twip email, right? So let me pick the winners out. Maybe I'll go in reverse order and then I'll

29:58.560 --> 30:05.760
 like remember as I go. So one of the things that definitely has been an issue is surgeons do not

30:05.760 --> 30:11.520
 like us vaccinating anywhere around when they might be doing surgery, particularly the cancer

30:11.520 --> 30:16.720
 surgeons. They're all worried that if we vaccinate particularly with an mRNA vaccine, particularly in

30:16.720 --> 30:22.320
 the field, let's say you've got a woman who has breast cancer in her left breast and you're going

30:22.320 --> 30:28.400
 to stick an mRNA shot into the left deltoid and then potentially have the enlarged lymph nodes

30:28.400 --> 30:33.440
 that we clearly see. That might be an issue when they want to do lymph node dissection,

30:33.440 --> 30:38.640
 sentinel, lymph node sampling, all these other things. And then that actually is reasonable.

30:39.360 --> 30:42.480
 And this is complicated, right? So it can be very hard on a

30:42.480 --> 30:48.560
 Twip to give the full answer. But yeah, there certainly are circumstances where I would defer

30:48.560 --> 30:53.440
 that vaccine. I know that breaks my rule, but never missed a chance to immunize. Yeah, there

30:53.440 --> 30:57.920
 are times when you're not missing the opportunity, you're moving that opportunity to a different

30:57.920 --> 31:03.760
 time. Now we have started in the New York area, giving the J and J vaccine to a lot of patients

31:03.760 --> 31:09.520
 before they leave. I do not think you need to wait a full 14 days. Much seems to be a much lower

31:09.520 --> 31:15.520
 incidence of fever and tolerance issues. So in this case, I actually have a patient right now.

31:15.520 --> 31:22.400
 She's in the hospital. She had a biopsy for her breast cancer. And we're actually going to go

31:22.400 --> 31:29.760
 ahead and give her the J and J vaccine in the opposite arm before she leaves. And I think that

31:29.760 --> 31:36.000
 this is going to have to be sort of an individual thought out. But I actually would not want there

31:36.000 --> 31:41.360
 to be this hard and fast rule for any vaccine. If someone's planning on a hernia operation and

31:41.360 --> 31:47.040
 they've got a chance to get a vaccine and it's 13, 12, 11 days before, I'm not sure we want to have

31:47.760 --> 31:51.520
 too many barriers. We want to get those people vaccinated. Because unfortunately,

31:51.520 --> 31:57.120
 when they come into a healthcare setting, we, sorry to say, have had exposure events.

31:57.120 --> 32:01.040
 And so I think we want to be careful. We don't want to have rigid rules there.

32:01.040 --> 32:07.440
 Now, the next is about testing. Hey, we have more and more testing capacity. We have quicker

32:07.440 --> 32:13.440
 turnaround. Those whole ideas about getting your test 72 hours ahead of time were in large part

32:13.440 --> 32:20.560
 based upon testing delays. If anything, I think we can ramp this up and have the day before

32:21.520 --> 32:26.480
 get a test and have results available in time for that surgery. We really do not want people

32:26.480 --> 32:32.160
 coming in, bringing them into healthcare settings, potentially exposing people who are

32:32.160 --> 32:36.640
 immunocompromised, who maybe wanted to get vaccinated, but didn't have an opportunity to.

32:36.640 --> 32:41.760
 I know we're all vaccinated, healthcare workers who wanted to. But a lot of our patients have

32:41.760 --> 32:45.920
 not been vaccinated. And I think that's going to be an issue for a while either through choice

32:45.920 --> 32:49.920
 or because they have an issue with an immune system failing. So I think we still have a

32:49.920 --> 32:56.240
 commitment to try to keep our healthcare settings as safe as possible. It was related a story today.

32:56.240 --> 33:03.360
 Unfortunately, where one of my good friends, his son had a skiing accident. They went to a hospital

33:03.360 --> 33:09.680
 near the ski mountain. They wanted to do a CAT scan because they were concerned about head trauma.

33:10.640 --> 33:14.720
 And the dad asked, well, why is this taking so long? And they said, oh, we just had a person

33:14.720 --> 33:18.400
 in the CT scanner with COVID. We're just going to give it a few more minutes before we put

33:18.400 --> 33:23.920
 your son in there. Five days later, the son started feeling poorly. He started feeling poorly.

33:23.920 --> 33:29.120
 The wife started feeling poorly. That was the only exposure they could really think about was

33:29.120 --> 33:34.640
 all that time spent in a healthcare setting. So we got to keep those places safe. It's a small

33:34.640 --> 33:40.800
 price to pay to continue to test to keep these places safe. And not only is a small price to say,

33:40.800 --> 33:44.400
 I'm going to say it's going to destroy the confidence. People are going to fear going to

33:44.400 --> 33:50.720
 healthcare settings if we can't keep them safe for them. I think that was most of it.

33:50.720 --> 33:58.560
 Yeah, I think that's great. All right, that's COVID-19 clinical update number 54 with Dr. Daniel

33:58.560 --> 34:04.320
 Griffin. Thank you, Daniel. My pleasure is always on everyone. Be safe. We're coming to the end of

34:04.320 --> 34:09.440
 this. You do not want to get sick now. There's lots of virus out there. We're sitting on a pretty

34:09.440 --> 34:21.680
 high plateau. Get vaccinated. Don't get COVID. Stay positive, but stay negative.
