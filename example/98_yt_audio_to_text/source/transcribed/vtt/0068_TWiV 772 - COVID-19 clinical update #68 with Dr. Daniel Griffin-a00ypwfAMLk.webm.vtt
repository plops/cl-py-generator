 This week in virology, the podcast about viruses, the kind that make you sick.

00:10.240 --> 00:20.720
 From Microbe TV, this is Twiv, this week in virology, Episode 772, recorded on June 24, 2021.

00:20.720 --> 00:25.920
 I'm Vincent Rackeniello, and you're listening to the podcast all about viruses.

00:25.920 --> 00:29.120
 Joining me today from New York, Daniel Griffin.

00:29.120 --> 00:38.720
 Hello, everyone. This is number 68, Daniel. And, you know, over a year of updates, it seems to me

00:38.720 --> 00:44.960
 that at least here in the US, things are getting better. You know, they certainly are, particularly

00:44.960 --> 00:51.440
 in many parts of the US. We still have our regional pockets, a little shout out to Missouri, right,

00:51.440 --> 01:00.000
 where the positivity rate is over 6%. So, but areas, I'll say, I was on a call earlier this week where

01:00.000 --> 01:04.640
 we were talking about can we start doing nebulizers, things like that, you know, with a little bit

01:04.640 --> 01:11.040
 more flexibility. So, nebulizers, if people are not familiar, is where maybe an individual comes in,

01:11.040 --> 01:17.040
 they're having trouble breathing. And we actually use a device called a nebulizer, which creates

01:17.040 --> 01:24.640
 small particles, right, that can be inhaled that have maybe bronco dilators, medicines that will

01:24.640 --> 01:28.880
 open up the airways, help them breathe better. Maybe they're having an asthma attack or a

01:29.680 --> 01:35.040
 COPD exacerbation. And we've been hesitant to use those, but we actually were saying, boy,

01:35.040 --> 01:40.560
 if a person's vaccinated, if your prevalence is, you know, your test positivity rate is under 1%,

01:41.680 --> 01:45.680
 you could start thinking about being a little bit more flexible. I mean, we've always done that

01:45.680 --> 01:50.080
 when it's been really severe at an emergency. And one of the people on the call said, that's

01:50.080 --> 01:56.240
 pretty strict under 1%, and I was proud to say here in New York, our test positivity rate is under

01:56.240 --> 02:01.520
 1%, and we are doing a lot of testing. But that's not true everywhere as we sort of bring up.

02:02.720 --> 02:07.280
 All right, so let's start with our quotation, and then let's get right into the thick of it. So,

02:07.840 --> 02:14.080
 the quotation, prejudice is a burden that confuses the past, threatens the future,

02:14.080 --> 02:21.280
 and renders the present inaccessible. And that's by Maya Angelou. And I like that because I think

02:21.280 --> 02:27.440
 that I feel like we all need to keep being reminded that we don't want, we don't want confirmation

02:27.440 --> 02:32.560
 bias. We don't want to go into something thinking we know what the truth is. We want to have our

02:32.560 --> 02:37.680
 eyes open so that we can actually continue to learn and move forward. Not everything that we

02:37.680 --> 02:42.240
 thought we knew a year ago has turned out to be true. And not everything we thought a year ago

02:42.240 --> 02:48.720
 that was untrue. That's turned out to be such. So, I think we still need to keep learning. We still

02:48.720 --> 02:53.520
 have so much to learn, and we'll get into that as we go forward. But the update really hits home

02:53.520 --> 03:00.080
 with Vincent, your first question, which was how are things going? And I'd say this is sort of a

03:00.080 --> 03:07.440
 tough day, a tough week on several levels. I don't know if our listeners know, but one of my cows,

03:07.440 --> 03:14.080
 my cow, I suppose, and my heifer actually died in Uganda. There was a viral disease. The

03:14.080 --> 03:19.280
 hoof and mouth disease was sweeping through Eastern Uganda, which periodically happens. And so my

03:20.000 --> 03:28.000
 cow died, which is tragic. I mean, tragic because you care about your animals, but also this was a

03:28.000 --> 03:34.000
 cow that was providing seven liters of milk a day to help feed people. And it was even economically.

03:34.000 --> 03:39.840
 This is part of the income that was helping to support Mary, my little heifer, who is only about

03:39.840 --> 03:46.640
 a year old. So that's difficult, right? For those of us, we talk about how difficult the pandemic

03:46.640 --> 03:51.440
 has been. We couldn't go to that bar. We couldn't see that movie. We were trapped in our houses. But

03:52.000 --> 03:57.520
 just really to bring home people in Uganda, where the virus is surging again, and there's a vaccine

03:57.520 --> 04:04.880
 shortage, this is about not having food. This is about going to bed hungry. Here, though, in the US,

04:04.880 --> 04:10.560
 right? Today, I was covering three of the hospitals, and my other partner was covering the other

04:10.560 --> 04:17.040
 three, just two of us covering these six hospitals, because one of my partners, Dr. Anujali, was off

04:17.040 --> 04:23.760
 attending the funeral of her brother's wife. And this, I think, was tragic. Anujis, sister-in-law,

04:23.760 --> 04:29.360
 was in her early 50s. She did not want to get vaccinated because she had learned through social

04:29.360 --> 04:36.320
 media that there were microchips in the vaccines. She went ahead, she got infected. Little over a

04:36.320 --> 04:42.800
 week later, she ended up in the hospital, intubated, died, leaving behind a husband and her teenage

04:42.800 --> 04:50.480
 children. This is just tragic. I think when people make up stuff like these microchips and

04:50.480 --> 04:57.920
 all these other crazy things, there's no science there. This is not a scientific debate. It's just

04:57.920 --> 05:04.000
 untrue. And that has repercussions. And someone's got to explain to these teenage children that they

05:04.000 --> 05:11.760
 no longer have a mom. So, as mentioned, we started our country as a patchwork with different ideas

05:11.760 --> 05:17.440
 about and different vaccination rates. Areas with high vaccination rates tend to be the areas with

05:17.440 --> 05:23.520
 low COVID. Areas with low vaccination rates tend to be the areas where we're seeing high COVID rates

05:23.520 --> 05:27.840
 and hospitalizations and deaths. What we're also seeing, and I'm sort of putting this in right

05:27.840 --> 05:32.720
 before the children, but we'll get into this, is that we're actually seeing all those common

05:32.720 --> 05:38.960
 winter viruses packed into June. So, now that everyone's taking off their masks, everyone's

05:38.960 --> 05:44.880
 celebrating, everyone's getting all the kids together and such, the CDC actually had to issue

05:44.880 --> 05:51.600
 an alert regarding a rapid rise in RSV, respiratory syncytial virus, particularly in the south.

05:52.240 --> 06:00.800
 But we're also seeing spikes in para-inchluenza, common coronavirus, particularly OC43.

06:01.920 --> 06:08.080
 I actually had recently a question from actually a clinician, which sort of shocked me. And they

06:08.080 --> 06:12.880
 were asking whether or not I thought the COVID vaccines were causing these people to develop

06:12.880 --> 06:18.320
 upper respiratory infections. And there is, I have to say, no way that a COVID vaccination

06:18.320 --> 06:24.880
 will give you para-influenza virus or RSV. So, no, this is behavioral. And I think a lot of

06:24.880 --> 06:30.640
 times we like to try to blame something else. But no, these viruses are now spreading. We're seeing

06:30.640 --> 06:36.880
 a lot of this. And in New York, we're not seeing much COVID-19, but we are seeing a lot of these

06:36.880 --> 06:44.080
 ERIs. So, important for people to realize that. Children and COVID, children are at low risk,

06:44.080 --> 06:50.320
 but they're not at no risk. So, never miss an opportunity to test. I'm going to jump right

06:50.320 --> 06:54.960
 forward here. I don't think this will shock anyone, but it's going to tie right into the

06:54.960 --> 07:00.240
 kids again. And this was the article assessing the association between social gatherings and

07:00.240 --> 07:07.440
 COVID-19 risk using birthdays. And this was published in Java Internal Medicine. And this was a cross

07:07.440 --> 07:14.640
 sectional study using administrative healthcare data on 2.9 million households from the first

07:14.640 --> 07:20.640
 45 weeks of 2020. And they found that among households in the top decile of the country,

07:20.640 --> 07:26.480
 as far as COVID-19 prevalence, those with birthdays had more diagnoses of COVID-19

07:26.480 --> 07:32.880
 compared with households that it had not had a birthday in the two weeks after that birthday was

07:32.880 --> 07:39.280
 held. Now, what I will say here is this really was significant in areas where there was a high

07:39.280 --> 07:44.880
 incidence of COVID, right? If there's a high incidence of COVID and you have a birthday party,

07:44.880 --> 07:50.960
 that's what's going to spread. If COVID incidence is low, they did not see this. And here, and I

07:50.960 --> 07:54.560
 think this is a perfect example here in New York, when people are having birthdays and other

07:54.560 --> 08:00.480
 celebrations, it's the common coronaviruses. It's RSV. It's the rhinoenteroviruses. It's the

08:00.480 --> 08:04.640
 the other common colds that are spreading. And I think that this is critical, right? As people

08:04.640 --> 08:10.960
 are making decisions, this really prevalence issue is important as you're making decisions

08:10.960 --> 08:15.920
 about what to do. And the other thing that is coming up here, and I'm going to sort of a subtlety

08:15.920 --> 08:22.240
 and nuance here, is that we're back in the times of low prevalence and poor positive

08:22.240 --> 08:28.720
 predictive value in many parts of our country. So this, people maybe remember that word orthogonal

08:28.720 --> 08:36.240
 for orthogonal testing. So if an individual comes in, maybe it's a screening, they're asymptomatic,

08:36.240 --> 08:42.640
 they need a negative test for some reason, it comes back positive. If your prevalence is less

08:42.640 --> 08:48.640
 than 1%, that's probably false positive. From a medical scientific point of view, you can repeat

08:48.640 --> 08:55.520
 that to clarify the picture. But most jurisdictions, the Department of Health is still operating

08:55.520 --> 09:01.040
 under the, and I hate these words, abundance of caution. You still need to treat that positive

09:01.040 --> 09:04.960
 as a positive. So if that individual is going to be heading off the camp, they've got to wait

09:04.960 --> 09:11.920
 those 10 days of isolation. So we'll see where that goes going forward. Active vaccination,

09:11.920 --> 09:17.360
 never miss an opportunity to vaccinate. And as I still believe vaccines are how this pandemic ends,

09:17.360 --> 09:23.920
 this comes up all the time. So I will touch on it. Maybe this is, I guess, more of interest to

09:23.920 --> 09:28.960
 physicians, more of interest to people with immune suppression, but I think it's of interest to

09:28.960 --> 09:37.040
 everyone. Another article was published, safety and immunogenicity of a third dose of SARS-CoV-2

09:37.040 --> 09:43.440
 vaccine in solid organ transplant recipients, a case series published in the Annals of Internal

09:43.440 --> 09:49.040
 Medicine. So a little background with which our regular listeners are probably familiar.

09:50.080 --> 09:57.360
 The antibody response after two doses of an M RNA vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 is excellent

09:57.360 --> 10:03.280
 in the general population, but can be markedly attenuated or even undetectable in transplant

10:03.280 --> 10:10.160
 recipients. So here, the authors reported on 30 patients that received a third dose of vaccine

10:10.160 --> 10:19.920
 in 22 patients. Maintenance immunosuppression included cachrolymus or cyclosporin plus mycofenolate.

10:20.960 --> 10:28.320
 In addition, corticosteroids were used for 24 patients, ceralymus for one, bilatosept for one,

10:28.880 --> 10:36.320
 the median time between transplantation and initial vaccination was 4.5 years. So what did they find?

10:36.320 --> 10:42.800
 Well, before they received their third dose of vaccine, 24 of the 30 patients had negative

10:42.800 --> 10:49.280
 antibody titers and six had low positive antibody titers. So remember, this is a case series that

10:49.280 --> 10:56.400
 we're looking at. The patients received the third dose of vaccine a median of 67 days

10:57.200 --> 11:05.200
 after the second dose of that initial vaccine series. So 15 patients received the J&J, the Johnson

11:05.200 --> 11:12.960
 and Johnson Janssen, nine received Moderna, six received Pfizer, BioNTech. And what did they find?

11:13.760 --> 11:19.120
 Repeated antibody testing a median of 14 days after the third dose, in this case,

11:19.120 --> 11:25.360
 a vaccine revealed that of the six patients with low positive antibody titers before the third dose

11:25.360 --> 11:32.160
 all had high positive antibody titers after the third dose. In contrast, the 24 patients

11:32.160 --> 11:39.200
 with negative antibody titers before the third dose, 25% went on to have high positive titers.

11:40.080 --> 11:46.960
 8% had low positive titers, and the remainder, so 67% just remained negative.

11:46.960 --> 11:52.080
 This is interesting, and I agree with the author's comments. There were certain limitations here.

11:52.080 --> 11:58.640
 I mean, limitations of the study, obvious right off, was this was a small and heterogeneous

11:58.640 --> 12:05.120
 convenient sample, and there were no assays for neutralizing antibody, no specific B cell memory,

12:05.120 --> 12:11.520
 or T cell response assays. This is interesting. We still need additional trials to determine

12:11.520 --> 12:16.000
 whether booster doses to prevent COVID-19 in transphine patients is warranted.

12:16.000 --> 12:21.920
 And of course, in my mind, the biggest thing here is we do not have a correlate of immunity

12:21.920 --> 12:27.760
 in the antibody test, right? So we keep asking this question, what does it mean if you are vaccinated

12:27.760 --> 12:33.200
 and your antibody test is negative? And we still, across the board, say, in general,

12:33.200 --> 12:38.240
 don't rush out and get your serology test after vaccination. These vaccinations are incredibly

12:38.240 --> 12:43.760
 effective. The conversation I was having with one of the oncologists today is we're not seeing all

12:43.760 --> 12:50.160
 these transplant patients, all these people with hematological malignancies who've been

12:50.160 --> 12:55.520
 vaccinated ending up in the hospital. So we're actually getting an experience that supports the

12:55.520 --> 13:01.120
 efficacy of these vaccines. Another article, and I think this sort of goes into the same area,

13:01.120 --> 13:06.800
 on natural infection and protection against reinfection. I have a few comments on this,

13:06.800 --> 13:14.080
 but the article is reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 in patients undergoing serial laboratory testing.

13:14.080 --> 13:22.560
 This was published in CID. Here, the authors analyzed 9,119 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection

13:22.560 --> 13:28.320
 who received serial tests in total of 62 healthcare facilities in the United States

13:28.320 --> 13:37.520
 between December 1, 2019 to November 13, 2020. They identified reinfection in 0.7%

13:38.720 --> 13:46.400
 during an average mean of 116 days or about four months, and there were two deaths associated

13:46.400 --> 13:54.640
 with reinfections. So the reinfections were associated with a 3.2% mortality. A great discussion

13:54.640 --> 14:00.640
 here where they compare their data to the 1.8% reinfection rate seen in the UK siren study,

14:01.360 --> 14:06.080
 and that had been published in SARS-CoV-2 infection rates of antibody positive,

14:06.080 --> 14:11.680
 compared with antibody negative healthcare workers in England, a large multi-center prospective cohort

14:11.680 --> 14:17.840
 study siren that had been published in Lancet back in April. So I did find it interesting that

14:17.840 --> 14:22.240
 the infection fatality rate was higher than most of us think, right? Most of us are thinking,

14:22.240 --> 14:27.440
 well, if you get reinfected, it'll be more mild, but an infection fatality rate of over 3%.

14:29.040 --> 14:35.760
 In this case, a couple of people died in this small cohort. We would not only expect with

14:35.760 --> 14:40.080
 improved therapeutics and close monitoring, right? These people are being closely monitored and

14:40.080 --> 14:45.840
 picked up early. I would not have expected to see deaths in people who've been previously infected,

14:45.840 --> 14:53.360
 and vaccines are available. I know the authors use the word only, but my interpretation is that

14:53.360 --> 14:57.360
 in about four to five months after infection, we're already seeing reinfections, we're already

14:57.360 --> 15:04.480
 seeing deaths. I think the data has continued to support that vaccines are a little bit better

15:04.480 --> 15:10.640
 than just natural infection. All right, the period of detectable viral replication,

15:10.640 --> 15:14.800
 the viral symptom phase, what I like to say, the time for monitoring and monoclonals,

15:15.520 --> 15:19.200
 and I like to add where you get your test is where you should get your monoclonals.

15:20.080 --> 15:26.320
 I have a couple things here before we hit monoclonals. So the first is what about antibiotics, right?

15:26.320 --> 15:32.720
 We all know a significant amount of antibacterial therapeutics have been given for this viral disease.

15:32.720 --> 15:42.800
 So the article, efficacy and safety of Zithromycin in COVID-19 patients, a systematic review and met

15:42.800 --> 15:48.640
 analysis of randomized clinical trials was published in reviews of medical virology. Now,

15:48.640 --> 15:58.560
 the authors analysis included seven studies with 8,822 patients. The use of a Zithromycin, that is

15:58.560 --> 16:05.120
 an antibacterial antibiotic, the Z-pack, which is quite popular here in the US, was not associated

16:05.120 --> 16:11.280
 with an impact on mortality in COVID-19 patients. The use of a Zithromycin was not

16:11.280 --> 16:16.640
 associated with an impact on need for invasive mechanical ventilation or length of stay.

16:17.440 --> 16:23.440
 The results in this rather large study showed that a Zithromycin as routine therapy in COVID-19

16:23.440 --> 16:30.000
 patients is not justified due to a lack of efficacy and potential risk of bacterial resistance.

16:30.000 --> 16:34.000
 I thought it was interesting because I looked through the comments and one of the comments was

16:34.000 --> 16:37.280
 someone said, you know, we already know this and this doesn't add much to the literature.

16:37.840 --> 16:43.120
 But unfortunately, as I pointed out, 88% of people with COVID have ended up getting

16:43.120 --> 16:49.920
 antibiotic. So unfortunately, no, people seem not to know this. I recently had a conversation

16:49.920 --> 16:54.320
 with someone taking care of a patient in India and the comment was, you know, we really had nothing

16:54.320 --> 17:00.480
 to give them except for antibiotics. They said, what do you mean except for antibiotics? They're

17:00.480 --> 17:05.520
 like, well, we didn't have oxygen. We didn't have steroids. All we had on hand was antibiotics and

17:05.520 --> 17:10.480
 we wanted to give them something. Don't give them antibiotics. That is not giving them something.

17:10.480 --> 17:15.360
 That's not helpful. That's like giving them HCQ, hydroxychloroquine. You're going to do harm.

17:15.360 --> 17:20.320
 You are not being helpful. This concept that only a minority of patients admitted with COVID

17:20.320 --> 17:26.800
 have a secondary bacterial infection. We had another article, characterization of bacterial

17:26.800 --> 17:33.600
 and fungal infections in hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 and factors associated

17:33.600 --> 17:40.240
 with healthcare associated infections. This was published in open forum infectious diseases.

17:40.240 --> 17:45.840
 And whenever I read a good article, I always remember Steve Goff giving me a hard time asking me if

17:45.840 --> 17:51.520
 that was a real journal. So I want to point out, if Steve is listening, that this was published by

17:51.520 --> 17:58.960
 the Columbia infectious disease physicians. They're at this prestigious university, Columbia University.

17:58.960 --> 18:04.560
 They're in New York City, Magda, Sobiesik. The head of our department was among the authors.

18:04.560 --> 18:10.720
 I was actually presenting to the group this morning. So if anyone's listening, I'm reading and

18:10.720 --> 18:17.040
 highlighting your article. My colleagues evaluated adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19 between

18:17.760 --> 18:25.040
 the 2nd of March and the 31st of May 2020 that had been hospitalized for greater than 24 hours.

18:25.760 --> 18:33.440
 They included a total of over 3,000 patients, community associated co-infections when they were

18:33.440 --> 18:40.480
 admitted or identified in only 6% of patients. And this is an important point. This is during

18:40.480 --> 18:47.760
 that acute inflammatory phase. This is when they're ending up in the hospital. 94% did not have an

18:47.760 --> 18:55.120
 acute bacterial infection that would benefit from antibacterial therapy. Later on, and we've

18:55.120 --> 19:01.440
 talked about this before, if you continue in the hospital, you can go on to develop a healthcare

19:01.440 --> 19:07.760
 associated infection. This is usually in week 2 or 3 of your hospital stay. They did see that

19:07.760 --> 19:16.240
 in 12% of these patients. Most of those infections were gram negative bacteria, but also about 20%

19:16.240 --> 19:22.880
 were due to fungi. And then as time went on, they were actually seeing more drug-resistant

19:22.880 --> 19:29.680
 organisms causing these. Monoclonals can't leave monoclonals out. There's always a little more data.

19:29.680 --> 19:36.320
 The article effect of monoclonal antibody treatment on clinical outcomes in ambulatory patients with

19:36.320 --> 19:43.440
 COVID-19, also an open form infectious disease. The authors reported when they compared rates of

19:43.440 --> 19:49.200
 emergency department visits or hospitalizations among ambulatory COVID-19 patients treated with

19:49.200 --> 19:58.240
 monoclonal antibody. That was an N equals 305 versus untreated. That was 6,354. That treatment was

19:58.240 --> 20:06.320
 associated with decreased encounters within 30 days. So odds ratio of 0.23. So about a 77%

20:06.320 --> 20:12.960
 reduction. So just we keep hitting on this. The most effective thing we can do, if we have missed

20:12.960 --> 20:18.160
 that opportunity to get someone vaccinated, is treatment with monoclonals. And as we mentioned

20:18.160 --> 20:23.600
 last time, if they show up at the hospital and they're still serology negative, meaning they do

20:23.600 --> 20:29.520
 not yet have detectable antibodies, there may still be some benefit, not this dramatic benefit

20:29.520 --> 20:34.560
 we're seeing in that first week, but still a little bit in some patients. Early inflammatory

20:34.560 --> 20:42.240
 phase, we did get a press release from Gilead. And this was Gilead's remdesivir. I've actually

20:42.240 --> 20:48.400
 replaced their brand name with remdesivir all throughout this, but associated with a reduction

20:48.400 --> 20:54.640
 in mortality rate in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 across three analyses of large

20:54.640 --> 21:01.280
 retrospective real world data sets. So real world evidence from nearly 100,000 hospitalized

21:01.280 --> 21:06.560
 patients provides clinical insights on the use of remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19.

21:07.520 --> 21:11.840
 Now this was data was presented at World Microbe Forum. Vincent, I don't know if you were at

21:11.840 --> 21:18.720
 if you attended World Microbe Forum. He's shaking head no. Okay. Well, at that

21:20.080 --> 21:29.040
 forum, they presented three real world data analysis that included 98,654 patients hospitalized

21:29.040 --> 21:35.120
 with COVID-19. So let's let's run through the three trials. So one was the double pine placebo

21:35.120 --> 21:44.000
 controlled adaptive COVID-19 treatment trial. So that's ACTT1. And this was looking at hospitalized

21:44.000 --> 21:54.000
 patients with COVID-19. There was a trend toward reduced mortality, 11% versus 15%. And the remdesivir

21:54.000 --> 22:00.800
 treated patients. So that was an N of 541 compared with the placebo N equals 521. Now in the overall

22:00.800 --> 22:06.320
 study population, a trend means this was not statistically significant looking at over 1,000

22:06.320 --> 22:12.960
 treated patients. But then they went and did a post hoc analysis. And in this post hoc analysis,

22:12.960 --> 22:19.360
 remember this data mining, as I like to say, patients requiring low flow oxygen at baseline

22:19.360 --> 22:26.240
 achieved a 70% reduction in mortality that they did claim was statistically significant.

22:26.240 --> 22:32.080
 The difference in mortality in the other subgroups was not statistically significant.

22:32.080 --> 22:37.680
 I think this plays into our practice, right? We are not giving remdesivir and not

22:38.240 --> 22:44.000
 recommending remdesivir for people who come in without the requirement of low flow oxygen.

22:44.000 --> 22:47.360
 And we already have some data we were concerned about there once they progress,

22:47.360 --> 22:51.280
 once they end up in the ICU or a ventilator that maybe they do worse.

22:51.280 --> 22:58.240
 Then we have the real world retrospective comparative analysis from the premier healthcare

22:58.240 --> 23:03.360
 database. This looked at mortality and hospitalized patients who were treated with remdesivir.

23:03.360 --> 23:11.760
 Bigger numbers here, N equals 28,855 versus matched patients who were not treated. Those were the

23:11.760 --> 23:21.120
 N of 16,687. And this looked between August and November of 2020. So the analysis included

23:21.120 --> 23:26.400
 adult hospitalized patients treated within the first two days. Patients were matched on

23:26.400 --> 23:32.800
 baseline level of oxygenation. And they all stayed in the hospital for a minimum of three days.

23:32.800 --> 23:38.720
 The primary endpoint was time to death. And in this large analysis, they report that they saw a

23:38.720 --> 23:45.760
 significantly lower risk of mortality in patients that got remdesivir versus those that not across

23:45.760 --> 23:50.160
 all severity levels, right? So people coming in with low amounts of oxygen, higher amounts of

23:50.160 --> 23:58.000
 oxygen, et cetera. And finally, they referred in this press release to the simple severe study,

23:58.000 --> 24:03.760
 which is a randomized open label, multi-center phase three study and hospitalized adult patients

24:03.760 --> 24:10.480
 with severe COVID-19, oxygen saturation less than 94% on room air, or receiving supplemental

24:10.480 --> 24:16.720
 oxygen and radiological evidence of pneumonia. As the primary objective of the study, five-day

24:16.720 --> 24:21.120
 and 10-day dosing durations of remdesivir, they did not include a standard of care

24:21.120 --> 24:26.560
 comparator arm when they initially set this up. But then ahead, the retrospective real-world

24:26.560 --> 24:32.320
 analysis that was presented at the WMF compared mortality outcomes of hospitalized patients who

24:32.320 --> 24:39.040
 received remdesivir in the open label extension phase, right? So they continued this study into

24:39.040 --> 24:48.960
 an open label extension phase. Here we had in that an N of 1,974, and then they created a propensity

24:48.960 --> 24:57.120
 score weighted comparator arm. Patients not treated with remdesivir was an N of 1,426.

24:57.120 --> 25:04.080
 The primary endpoint was time to all cause death, and the analysis found that in the overall population,

25:04.080 --> 25:08.960
 treatment with remdesivir was associated with a statistically significant mortality risk,

25:08.960 --> 25:14.320
 at 28 days versus those not treated, again, regardless of the baseline oxygen requirement.

25:14.320 --> 25:18.800
 So getting just a little bit, I'm starting to feel a little bit better about all the

25:18.800 --> 25:25.440
 money and resources we're putting on remdesivir, but these are huge numbers needed to show a

25:25.440 --> 25:35.360
 significant impact. So do you use remdesivir on your patient? So we still do, and there's really

25:35.360 --> 25:42.720
 a window in a sense of when we consider it, and so this is not giving it to every patient who walks

25:42.720 --> 25:48.400
 in the door, only patients who have an oxygen requirement or are oxygen saturation less than

25:48.400 --> 25:53.680
 94% in room air, and then not giving it to people with advanced disease who require mechanical

25:53.680 --> 25:58.640
 ventilation. But in that little window, we are doing five days of treatment. And I guess I'll

25:58.640 --> 26:02.160
 throw in the caveat, Vincent, if that person is getting better, we're not keeping him in the

26:02.160 --> 26:06.320
 hospital for that extra day for day five. If they're getting better, we let them go,

26:07.200 --> 26:13.360
 again, not feeling like that extra day in the hospital is worth getting an extra one or two days

26:13.360 --> 26:17.120
 of remdesivir. But at the same time, you're probably giving them monoclonals, right?

26:17.840 --> 26:22.880
 Well, so that's the challenge, right? So again, it's all back to our timing. If they show up

26:22.880 --> 26:27.840
 within the first seven to 10 days, we're giving them monoclonals and a 70%, 80% reduction in them

26:27.840 --> 26:33.360
 even coming to the hospital. If they do come to the hospital, the data would now say if they

26:33.360 --> 26:38.160
 show up and there's still serology negative have yet to mount an antibody response, monoclonals are

26:38.160 --> 26:44.320
 still potentially of some benefit. But that's the group that we're looking at at remdesivir.

26:44.320 --> 26:48.080
 So it's after the first week, we're getting into the second week, they're starting to get some

26:48.080 --> 26:52.000
 degree of hypoxemia. That's when we're giving them remdesivir. Got it.

26:52.800 --> 26:56.160
 It is interesting, right? Because you would think we'd want to give it during that first week.

26:56.160 --> 27:01.760
 Yes. You know, right? It's an antiviral. Let's give it when they have. But interesting enough,

27:01.760 --> 27:07.440
 we have not been able to show. And I think it's because we don't know in that group, right? 97%

27:07.440 --> 27:12.880
 of people are going to survive probably 80% or not even going to progress to need the hospital.

27:12.880 --> 27:17.600
 So you end up treating so many people who probably don't need exposure to remdesivir.

27:17.600 --> 27:22.000
 So now I'm going to jump to the long phase, long COVID. I'm going to try to keep these

27:22.000 --> 27:25.920
 down to 30 minutes. People have been letting me know we've been getting a little long.

27:26.960 --> 27:30.880
 And then maybe that's okay. Here we are at long COVID. But a couple things I want to say at the

27:30.880 --> 27:35.760
 end. And this is really important. If you're a clinician, pause it here, get yourself a pen and

27:35.760 --> 27:42.480
 some paper, be ready to go back to this. It's really critical for us as far as long COVID to

27:42.480 --> 27:49.040
 know who has it. And this, as silly as it seems, we need to have this coded so that people can look

27:49.040 --> 27:54.720
 through and see, hey, we're starting to see a lot of people with long COVID. So what have we heard?

27:54.720 --> 28:02.080
 I talked a little bit about this last time is we got some guidance from the CDC. So we have a code

28:02.080 --> 28:10.640
 on the horizon. This is U09.9 post COVID-19 condition code, not yet available in the US,

28:10.640 --> 28:17.040
 but we expect it to be available in October 2021. In the meantime, when you see someone

28:17.040 --> 28:23.280
 more than four weeks after acute COVID, they're still continuing to suffer. The CDC is recommending

28:23.280 --> 28:31.360
 we use the code B 94.8 sequelae of other specified infectious and parasitic diseases.

28:32.400 --> 28:37.440
 We really need to start tracking who are these people? Where are they? What resources do they need?

28:38.160 --> 28:44.400
 This is really a huge issue. It's a huge issue for the millions of people that are still suffering.

28:44.400 --> 28:49.520
 It's a huge issue for the employers. It's a huge issue for us as a society. So it's really

28:49.520 --> 28:53.760
 important that we're able to identify who these people are so that we can connect them with the

28:53.760 --> 29:00.480
 resources they need. And one of the resources they need is research. And so I do want to offer a

29:00.480 --> 29:06.240
 bit of hope to all these individuals suffering with long COVID. It's unfortunate that this is

29:06.240 --> 29:11.200
 impacting so many people, but the other side of that is it is impacting so many people. This

29:11.200 --> 29:18.000
 cannot and will not be ignored. There's a tremendous amount of research and medical attention being

29:18.000 --> 29:25.040
 put on this topic. So I'm really optimistic in the coming months. We'll be sort of shifting

29:25.040 --> 29:30.480
 some of our discussion away from vaccinations and monoclonals to what are the therapeutics

29:30.480 --> 29:35.440
 for these individuals who got COVID before we could prevent it or even who got COVID after we

29:35.440 --> 29:41.280
 could prevent it and are still suffering from long COVID. So before we hit emails, I will say

29:42.080 --> 29:48.000
 please take a moment. Through the months of May, June and July, we are continuing to

29:48.960 --> 29:54.320
 help support Foundation International Medical Relief of Children. They operate throughout the

29:54.320 --> 30:02.960
 world, South America, the Pacific, India, Africa. These places are really having a tough time.

30:02.960 --> 30:07.600
 You know, when you're planning that big celebration, maybe take a moment and send a few

30:07.600 --> 30:12.080
 dollars to parasites without borders so we can continue to help.

30:13.360 --> 30:18.400
 Daniel, what happened to the observation in the long COVID patients that vaccination

30:18.400 --> 30:25.680
 seemed to help some of them? So we are still seeing that in about 40% of patients. I should

30:25.680 --> 30:33.920
 mention that they are doing a study up at Yale, COVIDRecovery, at Yale.edu. I'm waiting for a

30:33.920 --> 30:38.000
 little bit more science, but we just keep seeing this clinically. We're seeing not quite half,

30:38.000 --> 30:44.080
 but a little less than half of patients who have the brain fog, the loss of smell, the fatigue.

30:44.080 --> 30:48.080
 You know, if you have pulmonary scarring, if you've had heart damage, if you had a stroke,

30:48.080 --> 30:52.640
 the vaccine isn't going to is going to undo the permanent damage. But it continues to be

30:52.640 --> 30:57.280
 encouraging seeing patients that have had this. I guess the next question, I think about the

30:57.280 --> 31:03.120
 renal transplant, the people that, you know, 25% got better with the first dose. We get up to 40%

31:03.120 --> 31:08.160
 with the second dose. Do we give them a third dose? I'm looking forward to studies on that.

31:08.160 --> 31:13.920
 And also, this will be an interesting population to look at, do antivirals work in these people?

31:13.920 --> 31:18.960
 Is this being driven by viral persistence? Or is it a pure immunological issue? So

31:18.960 --> 31:21.760
 I'm looking forward to some more insights into this.

31:22.400 --> 31:28.160
 Time for some email questions. If you'd like to send one to Daniel, it's Daniel at microbe.tv.

31:28.880 --> 31:33.840
 Jenny writes, I got J&J vaccine back in March. Recently, I heard on the news that J&J vaccine

31:33.840 --> 31:39.360
 is less effective against Delta variant than any two dose vaccines. I'm wondering if I should

31:39.360 --> 31:44.160
 consider getting a second dose Pfizer Moderna to increase my protection against Delta variant from

31:44.160 --> 31:51.440
 60 to 80%. So that's, I have to say, that's a great question. And a lot of people are asking it.

31:52.800 --> 31:55.280
 The party line, I'm going to give you the party line first, but then we'll go into the

31:55.280 --> 32:01.200
 week. So the party line is all of these vaccines are incredibly effective. Even should you get

32:01.200 --> 32:06.720
 COVID after vaccination, it goes from being a severe life threatening disease to maybe the

32:06.720 --> 32:12.960
 sniffle, something mild in most cases. The subtleties would be, if you said, oh, but I'm 80 years old,

32:12.960 --> 32:17.600
 and I have multiple comorbidities, and I'm homebound and I don't have a good care network,

32:17.600 --> 32:22.160
 then you start thinking about it. But in general, the vaccines are all incredibly

32:22.160 --> 32:27.440
 effective. We're not recommending that someone who is vaccinated with J&J go ahead and get an

32:27.440 --> 32:32.880
 mRNA vaccine. David writes, I'm especially vulnerable to COVID as the result of age

32:32.880 --> 32:37.600
 in a number of underlying conditions that was vaccinated in February was beginning to feel

32:37.600 --> 32:42.880
 freer in what I could do until I read a newspaper article reporting on a study finding that even

32:42.880 --> 32:47.440
 low doses of prednisone could dramatically reduce antibody production from the vaccine.

32:47.440 --> 32:53.440
 I was taking five migs of prednisone at the time. I was vaccinated for an autoimmune lung disease.

32:53.440 --> 32:58.000
 I took the antibody test and the result was that there were no detectable antibodies.

32:58.000 --> 33:03.040
 My doctor informs me that I probably still have some protection through other mechanisms,

33:03.040 --> 33:07.520
 but there's no way of knowing if this is the case or how significant the other protections are.

33:07.520 --> 33:11.680
 Dr. prescribing prednisone has told me I could stop it temporarily to get

33:11.680 --> 33:16.160
 re-vaccinated. If I do this and then resume the prednisone, are the antibodies likely to be

33:16.160 --> 33:19.920
 suppressed? Is there any way of measuring what degree of protection I have absent

33:19.920 --> 33:25.680
 measurable antibodies? Any advice for me? We keep hitting on this with the literature,

33:25.680 --> 33:30.480
 and I keep bringing up these articles because people really care. We have a majority of our adult

33:30.480 --> 33:36.080
 population now vaccinated, and people want to know did it work. A lot of our other vaccines have

33:36.080 --> 33:41.600
 titis B. Even though we don't think it's the antibodies that give you the protection, we think of it as a correlate.

33:41.600 --> 33:45.680
 You can measure that. A lot of people are asking these questions. A couple of things I'll say

33:45.680 --> 33:50.000
 they're encouraging. One is five milligrams of prednisone is actually quite a low dose

33:50.880 --> 33:56.480
 compared to what we're seeing in other populations. As I mentioned my discussion with the oncologist,

33:56.480 --> 34:01.600
 we are not seeing a lot of individuals like you end up coming in as vaccine breakthroughs that

34:01.600 --> 34:08.240
 end up in the hospital. We do think that the vaccines continue to be quite effective.

34:08.240 --> 34:12.880
 Now, what about your doctor's strategy that he's bringing up? Stopping the prednisone for a

34:12.880 --> 34:18.080
 period of time, let's say two or three weeks, getting vaccinated. This is something we did a lot of

34:18.080 --> 34:24.000
 times upfront as if we could. We would stop immunosuppressive medicines. We would have a person get vaccinated,

34:24.000 --> 34:28.400
 and then once they had finished the series, then they would potentially be resumed.

34:28.400 --> 34:34.560
 I think that's a reasonable strategy, but again, it gets back to this issue. The vaccines are

34:34.560 --> 34:41.280
 incredibly effective. We are not seeing individuals like you end up in the hospital. So maybe we're

34:41.280 --> 34:46.160
 still underselling the vaccines across the board. The incidence is going down. The prevalence is

34:46.160 --> 34:51.600
 going down. This is getting to be a safer time. At least for the next couple months, you have some

34:51.600 --> 34:56.640
 time to think about this. If we start seeing rates go up or let's say you live in an area with a

34:56.640 --> 34:59.440
 high prevalence, that's going to be a slightly different metric.

35:00.480 --> 35:06.240
 Finally, Mark writes, I'm a clinician and past clinical researcher who's been involved with

35:06.240 --> 35:11.920
 chronic fatigue syndrome since the mid-80s. I've seen and helped manage around 5-6,000 people with

35:11.920 --> 35:17.760
 CFS all the way from near permanently bedbound patients to impaired Olympic athletes in both

35:17.760 --> 35:23.920
 inpatient and outpatient settings. The story of many long COVID patients is, to me, indistinguishable

35:23.920 --> 35:30.640
 from my post-IBV, post-Dangy, and post-Rosse river viral cases here in Australia. In many of these,

35:30.640 --> 35:37.360
 a specific viral IgM remains raised, and abnormalities of tick lymphocytes keep supporting a hypothesis

35:37.360 --> 35:42.720
 of persistent immune failure to bring the infection to an end. The few COVID-19 patients with persistent

35:42.720 --> 35:47.040
 symptoms I have seen show the same immunology changes, although I know that this is a very

35:47.040 --> 35:52.560
 small sample and likely selection bias. We'd have very few cases in Australia so far,

35:52.560 --> 35:56.560
 but that will change with opening of our borders and our low vaccination rates.

35:56.560 --> 36:02.320
 My question is, could long COVID be a specific instance of CFS? No diagnostic tests, a wide range

36:02.320 --> 36:07.920
 of symptoms and disability? No clear mechanism identified a lack of disease, classification,

36:07.920 --> 36:13.680
 impairing care? You raised dysautonomia as one component, and this is especially common in

36:13.680 --> 36:19.440
 young people with CFS. Treatment for postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome POTS is well

36:19.440 --> 36:25.040
 established and does provide considerable reduction of disability for many while we await deeper

36:25.040 --> 36:31.120
 understanding of these conditions. Cheers from Australia. So these are actually really excellent

36:31.120 --> 36:37.040
 points all across the board, and there certainly are similarities in this population. One of the

36:37.040 --> 36:45.360
 things we learned from the CFS population was that a subset, if you try to just exercise them

36:45.360 --> 36:49.760
 up, so to speak, rehabilitate them treated as an issue of deconditioning. You actually can make

36:49.760 --> 36:56.160
 them worse. So we see a very similar pattern in a subset of these patients. The POTS, the

36:56.160 --> 37:02.720
 dysautonomia, there actually are a lot of similarities between these populations. That might be good,

37:02.720 --> 37:09.280
 it might be bad. One of the troubles we realize is that there was a lot of research at one point

37:09.280 --> 37:16.400
 looking at CFS, trying to figure out what was going on, trying to introduce helpful therapies,

37:16.400 --> 37:20.640
 and we did not make a lot of headway. So I know some people are looking at this and saying,

37:20.640 --> 37:27.040
 oh my gosh, is this the next CFS. But here's the big difference when I have those conversations,

37:27.040 --> 37:31.680
 is people got this all at the same time. I'm actually hoping it's the other way,

37:31.680 --> 37:36.880
 is that now, since we had a large number of people get infected at the same time, we all sort of know

37:36.880 --> 37:43.520
 when the onset was, that we're going to get insights into long COVID that can allow us to go back to

37:43.520 --> 37:48.800
 the chronic fatigue syndrome patients. I do suspect there at least are certain patients that have

37:48.800 --> 37:54.320
 similar mechanisms underlying this. I was going to throw chicken guñas, another one of those post

37:54.320 --> 38:01.120
 viral syndromes that we see. So yeah, I continue to be optimistic, but I think everything you said

38:01.120 --> 38:08.960
 there was really insightful. That's COVID-19 clinical update number 68 with Dr. Daniel Griffin.

38:08.960 --> 38:38.800
 Thank you, Daniel. Thank you, Vincent. Thank you, everyone, and be safe.
