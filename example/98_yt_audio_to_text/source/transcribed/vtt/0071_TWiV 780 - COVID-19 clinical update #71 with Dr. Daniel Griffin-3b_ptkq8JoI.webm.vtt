 This week in virology, the podcast about viruses, the kind that make you sick.

00:10.400 --> 00:21.120
 From Microbe TV, this is Twiv, this week in virology, episode 780, recorded on July 15th, 2021.

00:21.760 --> 00:27.840
 I'm Vincent Draconiello, and you're listening to the podcast all about viruses. Joining me today

00:27.840 --> 00:36.080
 from New York, Daniel Griffin. Hello, everyone. Daniel, this is update number 71. What's going on

00:36.080 --> 00:44.640
 here in New York City? You know, there's a lot of stuff going on and not great stuff going on,

00:44.640 --> 00:50.640
 so I'm going to jump right in with my quotation and then I'm going to give the update because

00:50.640 --> 00:54.320
 things are headed in the wrong direction. Maybe we'll talk a little bit about why.

00:54.320 --> 01:01.040
 So, in questions of science, the authority of a thousand is not worth the humble reasoning

01:01.040 --> 01:09.600
 of a single individual. And that's Galileo, 1632. He was Italian. Wasn't he Italian Vincent?

01:09.600 --> 01:14.560
 He was. And I think revered in his time, right?

01:17.120 --> 01:23.280
 Well, by some, not by everyone. A lot of people thought he was heretical to propose that the

01:23.280 --> 01:29.200
 Earth was round and all of that stuff. Yeah, and the whole thing's not revolving around the Earth

01:29.200 --> 01:34.160
 to move away from an Earth-centric world to view. Yeah, he got death threats, for sure, right?

01:35.040 --> 01:40.640
 Yeah, so maybe some of our colleagues are having similar treatment today.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.920
 I think we're all locked in our towers, right? So, a lot of parallels here.

01:45.920 --> 01:53.280
 But the reason I bring that up is I know, Vincent, you really are a leader in this,

01:53.280 --> 02:00.800
 but I try to do this as well. I want to share what the science says and not just echo what so many

02:00.800 --> 02:10.720
 people are saying. If you say it 10 times, it does not make it any more true. So, what is going on?

02:10.720 --> 02:16.880
 We are seeing an uptick. And you can read the same article with just a different title.

02:17.600 --> 02:21.840
 What is this being driven by? It's being driven by the virus. It's being driven by behavior.

02:22.480 --> 02:29.520
 But we're also seeing some other new developments. I just want to give people a sense. The amount

02:29.520 --> 02:36.400
 of COVID we're seeing across the country is increasing. My buddy, Poe, out at the Everett Clinic in

02:36.400 --> 02:43.440
 Washington, went for quite a while, not seeing much. And we talked on Monday. He was now seeing

02:43.440 --> 02:49.360
 30, 40 a day. I was on the phone earlier today with a friend of mine, Adam Fitterstein,

02:50.240 --> 02:57.760
 who runs our urgent care centers in the New York area, under Bonnie Simmons as his boss.

02:58.480 --> 03:04.160
 And he was saying he went many days without seeing COVID. Now he's seeing 10 or 12 a day.

03:04.160 --> 03:08.800
 There's a little bit of a twist on this. I'm seeing some interesting

03:10.080 --> 03:16.160
 situations. I'm just going to share a couple stories. The first one was a colleague of mine,

03:16.160 --> 03:25.600
 a physician, fully vaccinated, maybe enjoying himself a little bit more than I do.

03:26.160 --> 03:30.160
 Maybe not taking me to any precautions. Ended up starting to feel not well,

03:30.160 --> 03:35.600
 tested positive for COVID. So had a mild outpatient experience with COVID,

03:36.400 --> 03:41.200
 but then actually brought it home to his spouse. And so then his spouse had COVID.

03:42.160 --> 03:46.960
 Also, his spouse was vaccinated. So another it was another mild case. So one vaccinated person

03:46.960 --> 03:53.520
 getting infected, spreading it to another vaccinated person. In this case, both were mild.

03:53.520 --> 04:00.400
 Another story was a dad. And this is actually a friend of mine, not a clinician. He does

04:00.400 --> 04:08.960
 something else for a living. And he started to feel crummy right about July 4th, right? July 4th is

04:08.960 --> 04:15.120
 sort of a target date here. Went and got tested. He was fully vaccinated. And to his surprise,

04:15.120 --> 04:21.920
 he tested positive for COVID. And then his son, who's below the age of 12, started to feel not

04:21.920 --> 04:30.160
 great and also tested positive for COVID. So it's interesting. We have a lot of ideas about early

04:30.160 --> 04:35.440
 on after vaccination, having really high antibody levels, maybe keeping people from getting infected,

04:35.440 --> 04:40.880
 keeping people from transmitting. But now we're starting to get six months out from those early

04:40.880 --> 04:47.120
 vaccinations. Are we starting to see this because of waning antibody levels? Are we starting to see

04:47.120 --> 04:52.960
 this because of changes in behavior, right? So I just want to share those stories just in case

04:52.960 --> 04:57.600
 people have a question. If you're vaccinated, can you get COVID? Yes. If you're vaccinated,

04:57.600 --> 05:02.560
 can you get COVID and spread it to other people? Well, there's just two real life examples

05:03.840 --> 05:09.440
 in addition to the science I've shared in the past. But the majority of infections are

05:09.440 --> 05:17.840
 presumably an unvaccinated people, right? It is completely true. And not only are the infections

05:17.840 --> 05:25.280
 predominantly in unvaccinated individuals, but looking around 99% of the admissions

05:25.280 --> 05:31.040
 are in unvaccinated individuals. So just to repeat that, vaccinations are huge at protecting

05:31.040 --> 05:37.360
 you from serious disease and hospitalizations. 99% of the people that end up in the hospital

05:37.360 --> 05:45.280
 that are dying from COVID over 99% are unvaccinated. So get vaccinated if I haven't mentioned that

05:45.280 --> 05:51.680
 before. I feel like I may have. Now, there's there's a lot of pressure I know to keep up each week

05:51.680 --> 05:57.680
 in terms of what's happening with COVID. I had like a nightmare the other night. I was, you know,

05:57.680 --> 06:01.840
 being asked a question and something new had come out in the last hour and I did not know about it.

06:01.840 --> 06:10.240
 So I woke up in a cold sweat. Yeah, it was not COVID. It was just, you know, I don't know what it is.

06:10.240 --> 06:16.480
 But my hope with these weekly clinical updates is to take some of the pressure off our busy

06:16.480 --> 06:20.800
 clinicians and listeners. And my commitment continues to be that if there's something really

06:20.800 --> 06:27.600
 critical that you need to know, I'm going to make sure that I bring it up in my clinical update.

06:27.600 --> 06:33.440
 And for a deeper dive, I want people to keep listening to Vincent and the crew on the other

06:33.440 --> 06:38.880
 Twiv episodes. It really is important. I think we went into this. Why do I need to know so much

06:38.880 --> 06:44.720
 about viruses? I think that most people have realized that you need to know a lot about viruses.

06:45.440 --> 06:50.880
 And the more we know, hopefully the longer period of time before we have something like this and

06:50.880 --> 06:56.320
 hopefully we'll do better the next time. All right. And I will try to keep this, you know,

06:56.320 --> 07:03.360
 at my 30 minutes. But this was an exciting last week. We got updated school and child care guidance

07:03.360 --> 07:10.160
 from the CDC. This is the much awaited K through 12 school guidance. And I'm going to go through

07:10.160 --> 07:15.760
 that part of this in some detail. And I will, don't worry as I go through this, I'm also going

07:15.760 --> 07:20.560
 to return to the hot button issues because I have realized as I've discussed this, there are some.

07:20.560 --> 07:29.200
 So number one, the CDC has come out. Students benefit from in-person learning and safely

07:29.200 --> 07:36.800
 returning to in-person instruction in the fall 2021 is a priority. And so I've been saying this

07:36.800 --> 07:40.640
 for a long time. A lot of us have been saying this. The CDC is really stepping up and saying

07:41.200 --> 07:47.440
 school is a priority. Number two, right here at the top of the list, vaccination is currently the

07:47.440 --> 07:54.320
 leading public health prevention strategy to end the COVID-19 pandemic. Remember, we're ending the

07:54.320 --> 08:00.000
 pandemic. We have realized we will never get rid of COVID-19. This is going to be part of our life.

08:00.000 --> 08:06.400
 But in the same comment, promoting vaccination can help schools safely return to in-person learning

08:06.400 --> 08:12.320
 as well as extracurricular activities and sports. Now, I know it's a little bit of a hot button

08:12.320 --> 08:16.960
 issue. People have said, you know, the schools need to open. It's number one priority. There

08:16.960 --> 08:23.440
 should be no qualifications. There should be no rules. Just make it happen. We'll get into this

08:23.440 --> 08:27.600
 a little bit more. There are ways to do this safely. And I'm going to go through the science

08:27.600 --> 08:34.080
 behind these recommendations. Next, and this is the hot button issue. Masks should be worn indoors

08:34.080 --> 08:41.120
 by all individuals, age two and older, who are not fully vaccinated. Consistent and correct

08:41.120 --> 08:47.520
 masks used by persons who are not fully vaccinated. People who are not fully vaccinated is especially

08:47.520 --> 08:52.480
 important indoors and in crowded settings when physical distancing cannot be maintained.

08:53.280 --> 08:59.200
 And I'm going to get back to that because not everyone is happy about masks. I don't know if

08:59.200 --> 09:06.720
 people have noticed. The CDC recommends schools maintain at least three feet of physical distance

09:06.720 --> 09:11.360
 between students within classrooms combined with indoor mask wearing by people who are

09:11.360 --> 09:16.720
 not fully vaccinated to reduce transmission risk. This is when it gets a little touchy for some

09:16.720 --> 09:21.440
 people when it is not possible to maintain a physical distance of at least three feet,

09:21.440 --> 09:26.880
 such as when schools cannot fully reopen while maintaining these distances. It is especially

09:26.880 --> 09:32.400
 important to layer multiple other prevention strategies, such as mentioned indoor masking.

09:32.400 --> 09:38.160
 So what they're saying here is if you can't get that three feet, if that's going to prevent you

09:38.160 --> 09:43.120
 from opening, do not prevent it from opening, you got to open, we're going to use a multi-layered

09:43.120 --> 09:48.800
 strategy. You got to get those schools open as the push from the CDC. Screening testing.

09:49.680 --> 09:56.480
 Don't forget testing, screening testing, ventilation, hand washing and respiratory etiquette, staying

09:56.480 --> 10:02.560
 home when sick and getting tested, contact tracing in combination with quarantine and isolation and

10:02.560 --> 10:07.840
 cleaning and disinfection are also important layers of prevention to keep schools safe.

10:08.480 --> 10:13.600
 So remember, these are layers. These are lots of things adding up to achieve that safe environment.

10:14.480 --> 10:19.680
 Students, teachers and staff should stay home when they have signs of any infectious illness

10:19.680 --> 10:26.000
 and be referred to their health care provider for testing and care. This should have seen to me

10:26.000 --> 10:31.280
 like an obvious thing for many years. COVID is bringing this out. You send sick people to a school.

10:32.080 --> 10:38.080
 What do we think is going to happen? Now, this many school served children under the age of 12

10:38.080 --> 10:43.680
 who are not eligible for vaccination at this time. Therefore, this guidance emphasizes

10:43.680 --> 10:50.000
 the implemented layered prevention strategies. COVID-19 prevention strategies remain critical

10:50.000 --> 10:54.960
 to protect people, including students, teachers, staff who are not fully vaccinated, especially

10:54.960 --> 11:00.800
 in areas of moderate to high community transmission levels. And finally, locality should monitor

11:00.800 --> 11:06.400
 community transmission, vaccination coverage, screening testing and occurrence of outbreaks

11:06.400 --> 11:12.640
 to guide decisions on the level of the layered prevention strategies. And this is all available

11:12.640 --> 11:20.560
 to go through even in more detail at the CDC site. But as I mentioned going through this,

11:20.560 --> 11:25.040
 there are a couple hot button issues. So let me talk a little bit about the science

11:25.840 --> 11:31.440
 behind this multilayered approach that includes masks, improved ventilation,

11:31.440 --> 11:36.800
 testing and vaccination in children. And the CDC, in addition to this guidance, they actually

11:36.800 --> 11:45.600
 have a science brief. And this is science brief transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in K through 12 schools

11:45.600 --> 11:52.640
 and early care and education programs. And this was updated July 9th. So this is the CDC's attempt

11:52.640 --> 11:57.680
 to communicate the science that is driving these recommendations. And I do encourage people to

11:57.680 --> 12:04.400
 look at this information. I was having a discussion just yesterday with friend of mine, Dr. Lucy McBride,

12:04.400 --> 12:08.800
 you know, and she was asking like, well, what is the science behind these recommendations?

12:08.800 --> 12:15.680
 So let me go through. What is the science? I mean, the CDC is a science driven organization.

12:15.680 --> 12:21.680
 They're not going with hunches. And these are the four points that they base this on. One,

12:21.680 --> 12:27.920
 children and adolescents can be infected with SARS-CoV-2, can get sick with COVID-19,

12:27.920 --> 12:34.480
 and can spread the virus to others. So those are true. That's not something we can just deny.

12:34.480 --> 12:42.160
 Two, several studies conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic suggested that the incidence rate among

12:42.160 --> 12:48.320
 children and adolescents was lower than among adults. So remember, low, but not no risk. However,

12:48.320 --> 12:53.440
 the lower incidence rates may have been due in part two children when compared to adults,

12:53.440 --> 12:59.680
 having fewer opportunities for exposure. And I do really want to point this out. People say,

12:59.680 --> 13:05.360
 oh, only about 500 children died in the last year. When we had them locked away,

13:05.360 --> 13:11.120
 not able to go to school, not able to engage in all these activities, what happens when you

13:11.120 --> 13:16.720
 start having children with the same exposure opportunities, it's an odd wording, exposure

13:16.720 --> 13:23.760
 opportunities that adults have had. Point number three, although rates of severe outcomes,

13:23.760 --> 13:30.000
 for instance, hospitalization and mortality from COVID-19 among children and adolescents are low,

13:30.720 --> 13:36.080
 youth who belong to some racial and ethnic minority groups are disproportionately affected,

13:37.040 --> 13:44.880
 similar to adults, and COVID-19 deaths among persons aged 5 to 17 years, 120 deaths among,

13:44.880 --> 13:52.000
 let me say that again, 71 COVID-19 deaths among persons aged 5 to 17. We saw 120 deaths among

13:52.000 --> 13:57.360
 those aged 0 to 4. Those were all reported to the National Center for Health Statistics through

13:57.360 --> 14:04.960
 July 7. So just to point out, that was reducing these exposures to the children. We still were

14:04.960 --> 14:11.040
 seeing deaths. The CDC doesn't go into this, but I will point out there's also the issue of long

14:11.040 --> 14:16.640
 COVID. We've now we've focused too narrowly in adults, but also in children on just deaths and

14:16.640 --> 14:21.760
 hospitalization. Think about all the children we've talked about with cardiac manifestations,

14:21.760 --> 14:29.360
 with long COVID, who months after COVID are still not back normal. All right, number four, studies

14:29.360 --> 14:35.360
 of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in schools that consistently implemented layered prevention strategies

14:35.360 --> 14:40.640
 have shown success in limiting transmission in schools. And I'm going to go through a little bit

14:40.640 --> 14:46.000
 of the science here. And I do want to point out there is lots of science behind these recommendations.

14:46.000 --> 14:52.240
 These recommendations are based on about 100 peer-reviewed publications that one can access

14:52.240 --> 14:58.480
 and read on the CDC site. So we've talked about some of these studies before. One was the study

14:58.480 --> 15:04.320
 that we talked about in the end of May. It was a study of 11 school districts in North Carolina

15:04.320 --> 15:09.920
 with in-person learning for at least nine weeks during the fall 2020 semester. And they reported

15:09.920 --> 15:14.800
 minimal school-related transmission, even while community transmission was high.

15:14.800 --> 15:21.200
 Now these schools implemented and strictly adhere to multiple prevention strategies including

15:21.200 --> 15:27.440
 universal mask use, physical distancing. Now breaches and mask use likely explain the few

15:27.440 --> 15:33.440
 instances of in-school spread of SARS-CoV-2. So I want to point this out. This is kind of an

15:33.440 --> 15:41.200
 interesting issue. And I know I've gotten some less than friendly comments from parents. We can

15:41.200 --> 15:47.360
 actually keep children safer in school, give them the social and educational interaction that is

15:47.360 --> 15:53.760
 critical. Compared to if they stay home and they're socially isolated, at some point they're going

15:53.760 --> 15:57.840
 to get together with their friends. They're going to get together in a suburban home, which is a

15:57.840 --> 16:04.320
 high-risk environment. So just really good example here. Another study of elementary schools in Utah.

16:04.320 --> 16:09.360
 Maybe people remember this one. This is where they implemented layered prevention strategies,

16:09.360 --> 16:15.120
 such as mask wearing, cohorting. And they found very low transmission, secondary attack rate

16:15.120 --> 16:21.440
 of less than 1%. I don't think we talked about this one, but the study of the K through 12 schools

16:21.440 --> 16:28.240
 in St. Louis. Again, multi-layered prevention strategies in place. Only 2% of the contacts of

16:28.240 --> 16:35.120
 the COVID-19 cases tested positive for the virus. This was again in a context of very high community

16:35.120 --> 16:42.800
 transmission rates. We have a nice study out of Italy that they reference. They reference a study

16:42.800 --> 16:50.080
 in Swiss schools, a German school. And then they sort of finish off their discussion with a study

16:50.080 --> 16:56.240
 of private schools that reopened for in-person instruction in Chicago with the implementation of

16:56.240 --> 17:01.840
 the layered prevention strategy. And again, minimal in-school transmission. So I do want to point

17:01.840 --> 17:08.480
 out this is evidence-based. The CDC is not being whimsical here. We do want those kids in school.

17:10.000 --> 17:16.080
 And I will just throw one quick scenario, which I encountered today. It was an outdoor learning

17:16.080 --> 17:22.800
 environment. It was school, young kids. And they spent most of the day outside. But then what they

17:22.800 --> 17:29.920
 do is they have snack time indoors. So they all go indoors, unmasked, sit around these tables. And

17:29.920 --> 17:34.080
 one of the kids had COVID. So what do you think happened? And I was like, why can't they just

17:34.080 --> 17:39.200
 have snack time outdoors? Be separated apart. Then there wouldn't have been this exposure. There

17:39.200 --> 17:45.520
 wouldn't be a shutdown of the venue for 10 days. So I want to bring up not only can we keep kids

17:45.520 --> 17:50.880
 safe, but we can also keep them there in school, not in and out of quarantine and isolation.

17:51.840 --> 17:57.760
 All right. Pre-exposure period transmission testing. Never miss an opportunity to test.

17:57.760 --> 18:04.880
 Rates are rising as I pointed out. These rates are going to keep rising into the fall and the

18:04.880 --> 18:11.840
 winter. We need to keep testing. And we had a nice article comparing the diagnostic accuracy

18:11.840 --> 18:18.800
 of point of care, lateral flow antigen testing for SARS-CoV-2 with RT-PCR in primary care. This

18:18.800 --> 18:24.400
 was the REAP-2 study for those that were following this. It was published in the Lancet publication

18:24.400 --> 18:30.720
 E Clinical Medicine. And I think this was well done taking what we know about rapid testing.

18:31.280 --> 18:37.360
 This is a great diagnostic test early in disease in symptomatic individuals. And in this study,

18:37.360 --> 18:47.120
 they looked at 2,562 patients with mild to moderate influenza-like symptoms. That classic

18:47.760 --> 18:52.240
 that we think about with COVID, but we think about with a spectrum of other respiratory diseases.

18:52.240 --> 18:59.920
 You know, fever, malaise, cough. This was a general practice network in an Austrian district.

18:59.920 --> 19:07.280
 They were looking at October 22 to November 30, 2020. And all of these individuals, these

19:07.280 --> 19:16.480
 patients received a clinical assessment, including both a lateral flow rapid test, so an LFT. And then

19:16.480 --> 19:22.640
 all the patients that had suspected COVID-19 also went on to get that RT-PCR testing.

19:22.640 --> 19:28.560
 And they reported in this cohort an overall sensitivity for the rapid antigen test in the

19:28.560 --> 19:37.200
 acute illness of 95.4% with a specificity of 89.1%. They talk about positive predictive value,

19:37.840 --> 19:43.280
 but I'm not going to actually mention that, because as we all know, the sensitivity specificity

19:43.280 --> 19:49.360
 gets coupled with the prevalence, the pretest probability. So I'm going to leave it with that.

19:49.360 --> 19:55.040
 If you have a low pretest probability, if you have a low prevalence in your community,

19:55.040 --> 20:00.480
 that's going to impact the translation of your sensitivity and specificity into positive

20:00.480 --> 20:05.040
 predictive values. But what I will also say, and I thought this was really nice,

20:05.040 --> 20:09.840
 they had information on my favorite value. What is my favorite value? The CT value,

20:09.840 --> 20:14.800
 the cycle threshold values. And they reported what we would expect,

20:14.800 --> 20:20.160
 our listeners are thinking, do you think those people that had positive PCRs but a negative

20:20.160 --> 20:25.920
 rapid, perhaps they had really high CT values and low viral loads? Yes, that was exactly.

20:26.800 --> 20:32.800
 The rapid testing was strongly associated with CT values less than 30, and the duration of

20:32.800 --> 20:37.520
 symptoms being in those first three days. So those first three days, the high level of

20:37.520 --> 20:43.520
 RNA, that's when we're picking these people up. This is when we're picking up people who are

20:44.480 --> 20:49.600
 transmitting the virus or capable of transmitting the virus. And I'm going to throw a little story.

20:49.600 --> 20:54.080
 I think people like our stories. This was a sporting, a recent sporting event where they

20:54.080 --> 20:59.200
 brought people into a cohort. They did all the right things. They tested people, you know, 72

20:59.200 --> 21:03.840
 hours ahead of time. They tested them when they got in. And then day five, someone started to feel

21:03.840 --> 21:10.240
 ill. They tested everyone, one person, that symptomatic person was positive. Another person was PCR

21:10.240 --> 21:14.560
 positive. But in the high thirties, they pulled those two individuals out, and that was the end

21:14.560 --> 21:21.280
 of the spread. So think about different testing, serving different roles. Active vaccination,

21:22.000 --> 21:25.840
 we had a bit going on in this realm. I thought this was going to be quiet, but no,

21:26.400 --> 21:31.840
 the never miss an opportunity to vaccinate and vaccination is how this pandemic ends.

21:31.840 --> 21:40.960
 The FDA updated the J and J vaccine EUA to include Guillain-Barre syndrome. Reports of adverse

21:40.960 --> 21:47.920
 events following use of the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine under emergency authorization suggest an

21:47.920 --> 21:53.920
 increased risk of Guillain-Barre syndrome during the 42 days following vaccination.

21:54.880 --> 21:59.840
 And they're suggesting that this may be a rate of about two to three million to two to three

21:59.840 --> 22:06.880
 per million versus a background rate in the population of about one million. So when last,

22:06.880 --> 22:12.880
 we hear they're looking at about 100 individuals. The nice thing about the media getting this out

22:12.880 --> 22:19.520
 here is now clinicians and patients can report this to VAERS, the vaccine adverse event reporting

22:19.520 --> 22:24.480
 system, and actually got a call yesterday from a neurologist colleague of mine who said, you know,

22:24.480 --> 22:28.800
 I got a call from a patient. Is there a connection here with Guillain-Barre? I just diagnosed this

22:28.800 --> 22:35.120
 individual with Guillain-Barre and about 40 days prior they had gotten their J and J vaccine. So

22:35.120 --> 22:40.080
 this is going to help us make that connection. I do want to point out we're talking about, you

22:40.080 --> 22:47.360
 know, a rate to three per million. So again, as I always like to say, you are making a decision

22:47.360 --> 22:51.600
 between whether you're going to get vaccinated or since COVID is going to be with us, you're going

22:51.600 --> 22:58.320
 to get COVID. We saw Guillain-Barre with COVID. We see Guillain-Barre with COVID at a much higher

22:58.320 --> 23:06.000
 rate than with vaccine parallel here with influenza. We also got some interim immunogenicity and efficacy

23:06.000 --> 23:14.320
 data for the AD26 COVID-2 vaccine. That's the Johnson and Johnson and Johnson and Noviral vector

23:14.320 --> 23:22.960
 vaccine. And the authors evaluated antibody and T cell responses on day 239. That's about eight

23:22.960 --> 23:31.360
 months after a single shot vaccine regimen, but also six months after a two shot regimen where they

23:31.360 --> 23:37.760
 got one shot and they got another. Basically, what they were telling us is they excluded three

23:37.760 --> 23:42.080
 individuals or 10 individuals, 10 individuals, three got excluded. So these are not big numbers

23:42.080 --> 23:47.280
 here. One of the individuals had a breakthrough infection, nice spike in their antibodies because

23:47.280 --> 23:52.880
 that couple others had a big spike in their antibodies turned out they went and got some mRNA vaccines.

23:54.000 --> 23:59.280
 After they excluded those folks, they looked at the remaining and they reported that the spike

23:59.280 --> 24:07.840
 specific interfere on gamma CD8 and CD4 T cell response showed durability and stability over

24:07.840 --> 24:14.560
 this time period, the same with the antibody levels. There also was an interesting comment.

24:14.560 --> 24:20.000
 This is really just a one page or so. There's not as much in here as one would like, but there's

24:20.000 --> 24:27.440
 a lot packed in there. It looked like the neutralizing antibody breadth was expanding over time. So

24:27.440 --> 24:31.920
 that'll be sort of interesting as we get more data on that. So I think this goes along with

24:31.920 --> 24:37.120
 what we've seen. Those germinal centers keep sort of churning along. People have said two to four

24:37.120 --> 24:41.280
 weeks after that vaccine is when you're protected. Well, it looks like that protection continues

24:41.280 --> 24:48.720
 to evolve over some period of time. Now we also had another paper. This was forwarded to me by

24:48.720 --> 24:56.400
 my good friend Dr. Amy Rosenfeld. And the paper was effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines for

24:56.400 --> 25:01.920
 preventing COVID-19 hospitalizations in the United States. This was a pre-print. This was a

25:01.920 --> 25:10.160
 multi-center case control analysis in the U.S. adults hospitalized March 11 through May 5th, 2021.

25:10.160 --> 25:19.840
 And the authors looked at 1,210 participants, median age 58 years. 22.8% were black. 13.8%

25:19.840 --> 25:28.960
 were Hispanic. 20.6 had immunosuppression. The SARS alpha variant, the SARS-CoV-2 alpha variant

25:28.960 --> 25:36.880
 was the most common variant, 59.7% of the sequenced viruses. They reported overall vaccine effectiveness

25:36.880 --> 25:44.720
 for preventing hospitalizations was 86.9. They reported that the vaccine effectiveness in patients

25:44.720 --> 25:52.960
 with immunosuppression was approximately 60%. And for patients with active solid organ or

25:52.960 --> 25:58.880
 hematological malignancies, so solid organ would be, I will say, like a liver cancer, kidney cancer,

25:58.880 --> 26:06.000
 or a hematological malignancy, things like leukemia. The estimated efficacy was still over 50%.

26:07.680 --> 26:11.680
 So I do want to sort of point this out. And now we've seen a lot of these serology studies.

26:13.200 --> 26:17.040
 For me, this was the really interesting part of the study was looking at individuals with

26:17.040 --> 26:23.520
 active cancer, immune suppression. Despite those serology studies, which seem to have said,

26:23.520 --> 26:28.720
 oh, these people, they don't show this immunological evidence, tell them that they should get vaccinated

26:28.720 --> 26:35.120
 but act like they're not vaccinated. We're not seeing hospitals fill with these immunosuppressed

26:35.120 --> 26:40.560
 people. A immunosuppressed person who gets a high antibody level, we don't tell them to rush out to

26:40.560 --> 26:47.760
 a big party. But still, that individual who does not show a positive serology test, we're getting

26:47.760 --> 26:53.040
 growing experience as well as evidence that those serology antibodies do not correlate with

26:53.040 --> 26:58.480
 necessary with immunity. And we are seeing benefit in this population. So all right,

26:59.200 --> 27:03.840
 the period of viral replication, the viral symptom phase, right, the time for monitoring

27:03.840 --> 27:10.320
 and monoclonals, you know, and as I like to say, where you get tested, as ideally, we get your monoclonals.

27:11.120 --> 27:18.880
 We may be moving away from the BAM Linivimab at TESS of a MAB into other cocktails and other

27:18.880 --> 27:25.360
 therapies, but we did get a publication in the New England Journal of Medicine, BAM Linivimab,

27:25.360 --> 27:32.640
 plus a TESS of a MAB in mild or moderate COVID-19. And this was done back before we were seeing a

27:32.640 --> 27:39.440
 lot of the resistant variants. So this was a phase three trial in which ambulatory patients

27:39.440 --> 27:44.560
 with mild or moderate COVID-19, who were at high risk for progression to severe disease,

27:44.560 --> 27:51.040
 were randomly assigned randomly assigned in a one-to-one ratio to receive a single intravenous

27:51.040 --> 27:58.640
 infusion of either this monoclonal antibody combination agent or placebo within three days

27:58.640 --> 28:04.800
 after a laboratory diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome. So SARS-CoV-2 infection,

28:04.800 --> 28:12.160
 COVID-19. So nice and early, where we want to see it, the high-risk population, the primary outcome

28:12.160 --> 28:18.400
 was the overall clinical status of the patients defined as COVID-19-related hospitalization or

28:18.400 --> 28:24.960
 death from any cause by day 29. So a total of over 1,000, it was 1,035 patients underwent

28:24.960 --> 28:35.280
 randomization and received the infusion or placebo. So by T29, 2.1% of the monoclonal

28:35.280 --> 28:41.520
 infuse, the BAM Linivimab, a TESS of a MAB group, had a COVID-19-related hospitalization or death

28:41.520 --> 28:48.880
 as compared to 7% in the placebo group. So a relative risk difference, 70%. So about a 30%

28:48.880 --> 28:57.360
 risk reduction here, nice p-value, 0.001. No deaths occurred in any of the people that got the

28:57.360 --> 29:03.760
 monoclonals. There were 10 deaths in the placebo group. Also a little more data that there was a

29:03.760 --> 29:10.320
 greater reduction from baseline in the viral load, people getting monoclonals versus not.

29:11.600 --> 29:17.680
 So we are, this is, I think, proof of principle of the monoclonals. We are shifting to the right

29:17.680 --> 29:23.280
 monoclonal for the variant that you might have. But I continue to reinforce, this is incredibly

29:23.280 --> 29:30.800
 powerful effective therapy. All right. So more negative data on Ivermectin with the publication

29:30.800 --> 29:38.000
 of Ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19, a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized

29:38.000 --> 29:43.200
 controlled trials. This was published in CID, clinical infectious disease. Now I don't want to

29:43.200 --> 29:48.160
 spend too much time in this paper. As the authors point out themselves, based on the review, I'm

29:48.160 --> 29:55.280
 going to quote here, the quality of evidence was low or very low for all outcomes. And their

29:55.280 --> 30:01.680
 comment was that based upon available evidence, Ivermectin should only be used within clinical

30:01.680 --> 30:06.880
 trials. And I have to say, I was a little surprised that this paper was published in CID.

30:07.600 --> 30:12.880
 As the evidence they were looking at was really very low for all of the outcomes.

30:12.880 --> 30:17.280
 And I think if they had sort of gone in the other direction saying we have really low

30:17.840 --> 30:22.560
 poor quality evidence suggesting you should use Ivermectin, I don't think it would have gotten

30:23.200 --> 30:31.200
 published. There is a lot of Ivermectin being used out there. What I take away from this is we

30:31.200 --> 30:37.920
 really need a proper trial, not lots of anecdotes, not lots of small trials. We don't need sites

30:37.920 --> 30:45.520
 with Ivermectin in the URL to go. We also have sort of a word of warning. We have a lot of folks

30:45.520 --> 30:52.240
 out there using veterinary Ivermectin products, random doses, random periods of time, no clear

30:52.240 --> 30:59.600
 timing relative to infection. This just seems like a terrible idea all around. I do think that

30:59.600 --> 31:06.320
 we need really clear guidance on the role of Ivermectin either way. If we have clear,

31:06.320 --> 31:10.720
 well-controlled trials that say Ivermectin provides some benefit in some people at some

31:10.720 --> 31:15.280
 time, that's great. If it comes out the other way, we need to know that because right now this

31:15.280 --> 31:19.520
 is a bit of the Wild West. We have believers, we have non-believers, it's very emotional.

31:20.880 --> 31:28.160
 We need to know if this has a role in the disease. And I think this just sort of, if you like Ivermectin,

31:28.160 --> 31:33.760
 you're angry about this trial. If you're not excited about Ivermectin, this is the,

31:33.760 --> 31:38.640
 you know, I've always said, I don't know if this has, we just don't have the quality data,

31:38.640 --> 31:45.520
 we need to guide us in this issue. All right, I'm going to get right here to the tail phase

31:45.520 --> 31:50.880
 along COVID. And I want to say the CDC seems to have been really busy the last couple of weeks,

31:50.880 --> 31:55.280
 everyone else was celebrating the fourth, the CDC was, you know, mandatory workday.

31:56.400 --> 32:02.800
 On July 12th, there was an update on their post-COVID conditions page and under the

32:02.800 --> 32:07.280
 prevention section, there were two, what I thought were interesting comments. One,

32:08.080 --> 32:14.080
 the best way to prevent post-COVID conditions is by getting vaccinated against COVID-19

32:14.080 --> 32:20.320
 as soon as you can. COVID-19 vaccination is recommended for all people, ages 12 and older,

32:21.200 --> 32:29.200
 including if you had COVID-19 or a post-COVID condition. Now vaccination is not 100%. We certainly

32:29.200 --> 32:33.840
 have seen individuals with breakthrough infections that go on to get long COVID,

32:33.840 --> 32:38.400
 but that is a relatively small number compared to unvaccinated individuals.

32:39.200 --> 32:44.240
 Next number two, although I thought this was interesting, although media articles have reported

32:44.240 --> 32:50.240
 that some people with post-COVID conditions say their symptoms improved after being vaccinated,

32:50.240 --> 32:54.720
 studies are needed to determine the effects of vaccination on post-COVID conditions.

32:54.720 --> 33:01.120
 Then, under what CDC is doing, they state rapid and multi-year studies are underway to further

33:01.120 --> 33:07.120
 investigate post-COVID conditions. These studies will help us better understand post-COVID conditions

33:07.120 --> 33:13.920
 and how to treat patients with these longer-term effects. Now I think this should be reassuring

33:13.920 --> 33:19.040
 to the millions, and it is millions at this point here in the US alone, suffering with post-COVID

33:19.040 --> 33:27.280
 conditions. There was a BBC that I listened to earlier today, really talking about how the UK

33:27.280 --> 33:32.480
 has recognized the post-COVID conditions. The US has recognized the post-COVID conditions,

33:32.480 --> 33:38.480
 but the world is still dismissing this. And just think of all the COVID cases throughout the world

33:38.480 --> 33:41.840
 and all the individuals that are going to suffer as a consequence of that.

33:42.960 --> 33:47.920
 So there's really a commitment here in the United States, I have to say, there's funding,

33:47.920 --> 33:52.640
 there's an organized effort, there are hard-working, brilliant, committed people working on this issue,

33:53.280 --> 33:58.880
 and I am hoping that this science gets accomplished, and we can really help these individuals.

33:58.880 --> 34:03.760
 So before we go to the emails, I want to remind everyone, we're getting near the end of July,

34:03.760 --> 34:08.480
 we're almost at the end of our foundation international medical relief for children fundraiser.

34:09.360 --> 34:13.600
 And along those same lines, this is critical. This is an organization that works throughout

34:13.600 --> 34:18.640
 the world, working in those areas that are still being ravaged by the pandemic. The numbers are

34:18.640 --> 34:24.000
 going up throughout the world. They are not going down. People are getting sick, people are ending

34:24.000 --> 34:28.800
 up in the hospital, people are dying, people are recovering, but then continuing to have long

34:28.800 --> 34:34.960
 COVID symptoms. So this is not over. Help us and help FIMRIC, go to parasiteswithoutborders.com,

34:37.520 --> 34:44.480
 Time for some email questions for Daniel. If you'd like to send one in, the address is

34:44.480 --> 34:51.200
 Daniel at microb.tv. Now, I had one here queued up from D who wants to know what's going on with

34:51.200 --> 34:59.040
 Ivermectin. She has friends who are trying to get it online, prescription and so forth, but I

34:59.040 --> 35:05.520
 think you answered it pretty much, Daniel. So I will publish the letter in the letters part,

35:05.520 --> 35:11.520
 but I think we don't need to address it. So D, I'm sure you got an answer from Daniel just now.

35:11.520 --> 35:18.560
 So George writes, my four-year-old son had a surgically repaired VSD and ASD at six months old. His

35:18.560 --> 35:23.520
 annual checkups have shown normal heart function since then. As you know, he's ineligible for a

35:23.520 --> 35:27.920
 vaccine yet, but as we get closer to an approval for his age group, I wanted to ask whether the

35:27.920 --> 35:34.080
 recent myocarditis risk would give you pause if he were eligible today. It's frequently mentioned

35:34.080 --> 35:41.200
 that those who show symptoms of myocarditis or pericarditis post-vaccine respond well to treatment,

35:41.200 --> 35:45.200
 but it seems to go on set of what that treatment entails and how that applies to those who have

35:45.200 --> 35:50.560
 had congenital heart defects. As you know, they have a lifelong higher risk of endocarditis.

35:50.560 --> 35:55.680
 I'm leaning towards vaccination, but wanted to understand the risks better, especially at this age group.

35:55.680 --> 36:01.040
 And so this is great. And I want to say, I think it's great that you're asking questions.

36:01.040 --> 36:06.000
 There's no problem asking questions about vaccinations. There's no problem wanting to be

36:06.000 --> 36:11.440
 informed when you make this decision. We've moved past sort of the cattle approach of hurting

36:11.440 --> 36:16.880
 people through these giant centers. And particularly now, as we're looking at younger individuals,

36:16.880 --> 36:23.360
 there's a different metric. You look at an 80-year-old getting COVID versus vaccination.

36:23.360 --> 36:27.680
 There's no, there's really nothing. It's very obvious that vaccination is there.

36:27.680 --> 36:33.120
 But let's look at this case. So what we're looking at this point, unfortunately, is COVID is here

36:33.120 --> 36:40.560
 to stay. So your calculation is the risk of vaccination versus the risk of COVID. So focusing

36:40.560 --> 36:46.240
 just on the cardiac issues. I think I mentioned this last time, a friend of mine, Michael Amala,

36:46.240 --> 36:53.120
 Dr. Michael Amala, actually as a cardiologist, went through kind of the risks of heart issues

36:53.120 --> 36:59.840
 with COVID. And it's probably a couple percent is the low bar. Probably at least 2 percent of

36:59.840 --> 37:06.640
 people that could COVID will have some evidence of heart issues. Some of that heart issues will

37:06.640 --> 37:11.920
 continue farther along. If you do more sensitive testing, it might be as high as 50 percent.

37:12.560 --> 37:17.600
 COVID triggers inflammation that affects the heart in a large number of individuals.

37:17.600 --> 37:24.080
 So I see someone like your child that you're describing. And I say, boy, this is not a person

37:24.080 --> 37:31.280
 that you want at risk for COVID. The vaccine is not zero in terms of risk, but the risk there

37:31.920 --> 37:36.080
 is much lower with vaccination than it would be with having COVID. So that's the way I would

37:36.080 --> 37:42.800
 weigh that decision. Protect your child so that they don't get COVID. Take that tiny risk when

37:42.800 --> 37:47.280
 you know potentially it's going to happen with the vaccination. What is that treatment? It's

37:47.280 --> 37:53.200
 ibuprofen. It's a leave. It's about 48 hours of taking it easy, and then the child is better.

37:53.920 --> 37:58.480
 Quite a bit different than so many of the children that we've seen with long-term effects after COVID.

38:00.160 --> 38:04.960
 James writes, dear Dr. Griffin, I'm so grateful for your podcast to the point the 20-something

38:04.960 --> 38:10.720
 year-old son of one of my co-workers tested positive today for COVID-19. He reported symptoms

38:10.720 --> 38:16.800
 yesterday. Should he be given monoclonal therapy or is such therapy reserved for higher risk patients?

38:18.240 --> 38:24.160
 Yeah, this is almost the exact question I was just answering earlier today. It's a

38:24.160 --> 38:29.760
 colleague of mine, had a family member who ended up, and actually, in that case, it was a second

38:29.760 --> 38:37.040
 infection, which just troubles me. With these individuals who are 20 years old, they're considered

38:37.040 --> 38:42.320
 at low risk. Even though the monoclonal antibodies are considered at very low risk safe therapy,

38:42.320 --> 38:49.040
 we still have a limit to the EUA. These are sitting on shelves, but you have to go through and say,

38:49.040 --> 38:54.560
 is this an individual who maybe their BMI is above 25? Actually, and you can Google, I'm going to

38:54.560 --> 39:02.400
 say Google or Search, Internet Search, the Regeneron monoclonal fact sheet, and there's a list.

39:02.400 --> 39:08.320
 But if there's diabetes, if there's any of these things, reach out to a clinician, have them help

39:08.320 --> 39:14.560
 you work through this. If you've got a 20-year-old with a BMI of 26, they would qualify and be

39:14.560 --> 39:19.360
 eligible for monoclonals, and it would make sense. So there's combination here of a risk-benefit

39:19.360 --> 39:25.360
 ratio, but there's also a limited access, because this is still EUA products. These don't have quite

39:25.360 --> 39:28.400
 the experience where we would start extending that off-label.

39:28.400 --> 39:35.600
 And Martin from the UK writes, I'm seeking facts or merely off-the-record opinion as to whether

39:35.600 --> 39:42.880
 Pfizer or other vaccinated asthma patients with occasional recourse to prednisolone run the risk

39:42.880 --> 39:48.160
 of negating the benefits of vaccine effectiveness, or of significantly reducing immunity by

39:48.160 --> 39:55.040
 medicating with low dose prednisolone, say, daily five to 10 eggs for a week or two. I'm assuming

39:55.040 --> 40:00.960
 more typical rescue dosage of prednisolone. 40-migs daily would certainly best be avoided,

40:00.960 --> 40:05.760
 unless the degree of exacerbation presented its own major health risk. Are you aware of any

40:05.760 --> 40:10.560
 research on this topic? Could you venture a generalized opinion? What are the respiratory

40:10.560 --> 40:16.000
 team in your hospital advising such asthma patients to do about oral steroid use during COVID?

40:16.000 --> 40:21.920
 Also, is there a similar vaccine-negating or immunity-lowering risk for inhaler usage,

40:21.920 --> 40:26.080
 where maximum licensed daily-inhaled steroids have been prescribed?

40:27.200 --> 40:33.200
 Okay, so these are great, this great line of questioning. So we do have some data, at least on

40:33.200 --> 40:38.480
 the serologies, right, that if someone gets vaccinated, and this makes sense immunologically,

40:38.480 --> 40:43.200
 we would expect there to be a less robust antibody response. I don't think the steroids are going

40:43.200 --> 40:47.680
 to have as much of an impact on your T-cell response, but we are in general recommending

40:47.680 --> 40:53.440
 if you can stay off of immunosuppressants for a couple weeks before that vaccination.

40:54.480 --> 40:58.640
 Hopefully stay off till you finish the cycle, so try to reduce that if possible.

40:58.640 --> 41:04.240
 Inhaled are definitely going to have a lower systemic level than taken orally,

41:04.240 --> 41:09.760
 so we would think of that as preferable. We do think these individuals are getting protection

41:09.760 --> 41:14.080
 from the vaccines, but what we're trying to do is limit the drug and other effects on the immune

41:14.080 --> 41:21.360
 response. That's COVID-19 clinical update number 71 with Dr. Daniel Griffin. Thank you, Daniel.

41:21.360 --> 41:51.200
 Oh, thank you, Vincent. Thank you, everybody, and be safe.
