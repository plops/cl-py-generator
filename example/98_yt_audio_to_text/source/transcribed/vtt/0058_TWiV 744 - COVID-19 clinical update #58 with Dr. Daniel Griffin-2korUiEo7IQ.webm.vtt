 This week in virology, the podcast about viruses, the kind that make you sick.

00:10.320 --> 00:22.000
 From MicroTV, this is Twiv, this week in virology episode 744 recorded on April 15th, 2021.

00:22.000 --> 00:27.040
 I'm Vincent Rackeniello, and you're listening to the podcast All About Viruses.

00:27.040 --> 00:31.360
 Joining me today from New York, Daniel Griffin.

00:31.360 --> 00:32.960
 Hello, everyone.

00:33.840 --> 00:36.960
 This is clinical update number 58.

00:37.760 --> 00:39.920
 Things gotten better since last week, Daniel.

00:41.360 --> 00:46.960
 I'm not going to say that they have, and I will start off with the quotation that is in line with

00:46.960 --> 00:53.920
 that. When things are going well, something will go wrong. When things just can't get any worse,

00:53.920 --> 00:59.440
 they will. Anytime things appear to be going better, you have overlooked something.

01:00.880 --> 01:04.720
 And that is the immortal words of Richard Feynman.

01:04.720 --> 01:07.040
 Excellent. That's perfect for this week, isn't it?

01:08.400 --> 01:15.440
 Yes. Actually, I don't know if people have a chance to read, but he's written a few books.

01:15.440 --> 01:19.120
 One of them surely you must be joking is one of my favorites.

01:19.120 --> 01:23.840
 But, yes, this has been a very tough week.

01:25.120 --> 01:30.960
 Never miss an opportunity to vaccinate, never miss an opportunity to test, never waste a vaccine

01:30.960 --> 01:37.040
 dose. Let me start off with my update. We've got a lot of stuff that happened this last week,

01:37.040 --> 01:41.920
 so we have a lot to cover. But this week there was some attention given to

01:41.920 --> 01:47.760
 lost on the front line, which has been a 12-month investigation by the Guardian,

01:47.760 --> 01:52.400
 Cage, and to track healthcare worker deaths during the pandemic.

01:53.200 --> 02:00.560
 And I found that reading the article, this was titled, 12 months of trauma, more than 3,600

02:00.560 --> 02:07.120
 US health workers died in COVID's first year. It was a very emotional experience for me to read

02:07.120 --> 02:12.800
 this through. I focus on the science, what we can learn from this experience, what we have

02:12.800 --> 02:17.520
 learned about how to treat this horrible disease. But all the work we still need to

02:17.520 --> 02:23.680
 do, and I think to take stock of what we've really been through is upsetting.

02:24.640 --> 02:29.360
 As I ever count, thousands of health care workers that have died over the last year,

02:31.200 --> 02:36.080
 many of these are my colleagues, many of these individuals I've known,

02:36.080 --> 02:41.280
 trained with. There were some key findings that were here in this publication,

02:41.280 --> 02:48.720
 and just a few of them. One, more than half of those who died were younger than 60.

02:49.680 --> 02:56.160
 And I think that is something. The general population, the median age of people who died

02:56.160 --> 03:03.280
 from COVID is in the 70s. But in the healthcare worker population, it was younger. The other

03:03.280 --> 03:10.720
 nurses and support staff died in far higher numbers than physicians. So there's an equity

03:10.720 --> 03:18.000
 issue here, where the physicians were either better able to or better helped to keep themselves

03:18.000 --> 03:22.000
 safe. As I think a lot of people know, if they've ever been in the hospital,

03:22.000 --> 03:27.040
 ever interacted with healthcare, it's the nurses, it's the assistants, it's the age

03:27.600 --> 03:34.800
 who are really in their hands on. And one or the other, twice as many workers,

03:34.800 --> 03:41.280
 healthcare workers died in nursing homes as in the hospitals. And this is something

03:41.280 --> 03:46.720
 particularly sort of sensitive issue for me, because of all the controversies about the nursing

03:46.720 --> 03:51.360
 homes and the fact that a lot of those workers were, I have to say, blamed, you know, say,

03:51.360 --> 03:55.520
 oh, those hardworking healthcare workers brought it into the nursing homes. It's really tragic

03:55.520 --> 04:00.000
 just how many of my colleagues have died through the last year. The last week, I was

04:00.000 --> 04:04.960
 talking with one of my partners and Nuja Lee, who is now the associate chief of the Division

04:04.960 --> 04:10.320
 of Infectious Disease for Pro Health New York. Just about how fondly I remember all the support

04:10.320 --> 04:14.640
 and recognition we received from our communities during these difficult times, you know, the free

04:14.640 --> 04:20.640
 food, the evening vigils, the placards, some of those are still up. Just let everyone know,

04:20.640 --> 04:26.960
 this has really meant a tremendous amount. Things continue to be tough, but I have to say all the

04:26.960 --> 04:33.600
 support has really meant something. So thank you. In addition to all my colleagues that died

04:33.600 --> 04:39.440
 directly from COVID, I suspect many of our listeners are aware of how many. Well, more than one of

04:39.440 --> 04:45.280
 my colleagues, you know, you may even know sort of in local community circles here, just found this

04:45.280 --> 04:48.880
 whole tragedy be too much and actually took their own lives during these dark times. So,

04:50.000 --> 04:55.120
 you know, this continues to be a difficult time. We are on a plateau with far too many people

04:55.120 --> 05:00.480
 getting infected far too many people dying here in the US were on a plateau. But when we look

05:00.480 --> 05:05.280
 beyond our borders and we don't have to look very far, we can see those numbers. We're now seeing

05:05.280 --> 05:12.240
 counted over 5 million new cases a week. And the death toll just keeps climbing. So we are,

05:12.240 --> 05:20.320
 we are nowhere near mission accomplished here. All right. On that happy note, children and COVID

05:20.320 --> 05:25.600
 and masks, I'm going to throw in here. So perhaps I'll be remembered for a few things.

05:26.560 --> 05:33.040
 You know, after this settles down, you know, one of them trying to point out early on the tragedy

05:33.040 --> 05:39.920
 of long COVID and not to dismiss these individuals that this was real. But I think the other is for

05:39.920 --> 05:46.640
 repeatedly my attempts to point out that children, I believe are at lower risk, but they're not at

05:46.640 --> 05:52.720
 no risk. So there was a research letter that was published in JAMA characteristics and disease

05:52.720 --> 06:00.000
 severity of US children and adolescents diagnosed with COVID-19. Now, the authors here were affiliated

06:00.000 --> 06:08.480
 with the COVID-19 response team at the CDC, the Epidemic Intelligence Service Center for Surveillance,

06:08.480 --> 06:16.080
 Epidemiology and Laboratory Sciences, also at the CDC, and the Commissioned Core US Public Health

06:16.080 --> 06:24.240
 Service in Rockland, Maryland. And a couple of things that this article pointed out. One was that

06:24.880 --> 06:32.800
 more than 2 million pediatric COVID-19 cases were reported in the United States, you know, in 2020.

06:33.840 --> 06:39.120
 And they say, although approximately half of pediatric patients with COVID-19 experience mild

06:39.120 --> 06:44.720
 disease, some children require admission to intensive care units or require the use of invasive

06:44.720 --> 06:51.360
 mechanical ventilation. And what they did here is they conducted a cohort study to try to estimate

06:51.920 --> 06:58.800
 just an association between demographic clinical characteristics and severe COVID-19 among hospitalized

06:58.800 --> 07:03.680
 pediatric patients. So we just go through a little bit of what they present to us, but then I'm going

07:03.680 --> 07:12.720
 to give the caveats as well. So they they evaluated a cohort of 20,714 pediatric patients with COVID-19

07:12.720 --> 07:21.200
 pretty evenly split, about 52.9% were girls. The other half males, right? So we have sort of a split

07:21.200 --> 07:29.520
 here. They reported that of these individuals, 11.7% were hospitalized, and of those hospitalized,

07:29.520 --> 07:38.320
 about a third had severe COVID with management in the ICU. So a lot of caveats here. I think that we

07:38.320 --> 07:44.000
 can say a couple things from the study one, and this seems consistent with the experience shared

07:44.000 --> 07:49.920
 among my pediatric colleagues, is that if a person under the age of 18 ends up in the hospital,

07:50.560 --> 07:56.400
 as we saw this cohort, a quarter to a third of them will be taken care of in the ICU.

07:57.120 --> 08:03.120
 One of the things the authors even said is it isn't even necessarily the same level of severity

08:03.120 --> 08:08.880
 we might see an adult that prompts that, but we sort of have a heightened level of concern for our

08:09.520 --> 08:16.720
 younger individuals. One of the things that is tough, I don't think we really have a good sense,

08:16.720 --> 08:22.880
 and I've touched this before, about how many kids with COVID actually go undiagnosed.

08:23.680 --> 08:28.400
 You know, we never find all the asymptomatic kids, and we certainly never find the untested

08:28.400 --> 08:34.720
 symptomatic kids. So I don't think we have a true denominator here. So the one thing I'm going to

08:34.720 --> 08:41.840
 say, and I like to be honest on this, when I see 11.7% of kids that get COVID end up in the hospital,

08:41.840 --> 08:48.160
 I don't think that really is consistent with our experience. I think 11.7% of this cohort

08:48.160 --> 08:53.600
 ended up in the hospital, that is true. But I'm not sure this is representative of the entire

08:53.600 --> 09:00.320
 pediatric cohort. I think if that was actually happening, our pediatric hospitals would not be

09:00.320 --> 09:06.320
 as quiet as they were during the pandemic to date. That may be different in different countries.

09:06.320 --> 09:10.240
 Some positive news on the vaccine front. Don't worry, I'll get to the negative.

09:11.200 --> 09:16.800
 Pfizer, BioNTech, did announce that they are requesting expansion of their E-way to include

09:16.800 --> 09:23.760
 individuals age 12, 13, 14, and 15. And I discussed a week ago when we recorded the last

09:23.760 --> 09:28.320
 wave that this was sort of impending. And once that was announced, the clock would start with a

09:28.320 --> 09:35.520
 minimum of 15 days from the announcement. So we're moving into that. So we're hoping that in

09:35.520 --> 09:44.320
 May, we're going to see Pfizer expanded down to age 12. Also, still in the children in COVID,

09:44.320 --> 09:51.040
 I've been getting a lot of communications about this. I think many people are comfortable with the

09:51.040 --> 09:56.800
 idea that schools can be safely open. But I'm getting a lot of questions about something I brought

09:56.800 --> 10:04.160
 up on the last 12. And this is this seeming disconnect between it's safe for the kids to sit

10:04.160 --> 10:12.560
 three feet apart with masks on. And at the same point, the CDC considering being within less than

10:12.560 --> 10:20.320
 six feet, so at three feet, regardless of masks being an exposure. So where are we with? What are

10:20.320 --> 10:28.080
 the updated as of March 21st, 2021 CDC public health guidance for community related exposure

10:28.080 --> 10:36.000
 definitions and guidance? So as per the CDC, individuals who have had close contact within six feet

10:36.000 --> 10:41.600
 for a total of 15 minutes or more exposed to, and I'm going to pause there for a second, right? So the

10:41.600 --> 10:48.880
 CDC is still using that 15 minutes. I know a lot of times you see the 10 minutes thrown out there,

10:48.880 --> 10:55.200
 but sort of scouring through the CDC website 15 minutes seems to be what the CDC is still

10:55.200 --> 11:04.000
 still putting out there exposed to to whom to a person with COVID-19 who either has symptoms

11:04.000 --> 11:10.880
 or in the period two days before symptom onset until they meet the criteria for discontinuing

11:11.440 --> 11:17.600
 isolation, right? So that is either 10 days or there's the test out ending isolation option.

11:18.560 --> 11:25.280
 Or the other is a person who has tested positive for COVID-19, but it has not had any symptoms. So

11:25.280 --> 11:29.520
 again, you can do the same thing. You're going to use that as your start date and the exposure is

11:29.520 --> 11:35.360
 anytime two days prior to that positive test or until they meet the criteria for ending the

11:35.360 --> 11:41.120
 isolation. So the two issues here, the first one I pointed out, 10 minutes versus 15 minutes,

11:41.120 --> 11:47.840
 the CDC is still using the 15 minutes. But then there was a note, there's a note sort of right

11:47.840 --> 11:55.520
 below this, and it says note this exposure, this is irrespective of whether the person with COVID-19

11:55.520 --> 12:02.400
 or the contact was wearing a mask or whether the contact was wearing respiratory, personal,

12:02.400 --> 12:09.600
 protective equipment, PPA. So wait, do masks work? We were just told, right, that three feet of

12:09.600 --> 12:16.240
 distance with everyone wearing masks in schools is minimal risk. So here comes down to the issue

12:16.240 --> 12:24.560
 is should the CDC update guidance for what is considered a school exposure and what ends up

12:24.560 --> 12:28.480
 triggering quarantine? I will stay one of the schools in our area, not right here in Port

12:28.480 --> 12:34.880
 Washington, one of our local schools has been in contact with the local community of health,

12:34.880 --> 12:39.520
 local department of health, and they've actually sort of updated their local guidance and said,

12:39.520 --> 12:43.760
 no, if we're going to allow these schools to open under these circumstances, if everyone's wearing

12:43.760 --> 12:49.840
 masks, three feet apart with enforced mask wearing, if that's really being held to, we're not considered

12:49.840 --> 12:56.640
 that, can you consider that a trigger for quarantine? So I think this is an important issue.

12:57.920 --> 13:04.800
 If being three feet apart, less than six feet wearing mask indoors at a school should count

13:04.800 --> 13:10.080
 as an exposure, this is actually an interesting issue because for health care workers, we actually

13:10.080 --> 13:16.160
 have slightly different rules, right? For health care workers, there's the idea that we know how

13:16.160 --> 13:23.120
 to properly wear masks, and there is some concern that at least per the CDC up till now,

13:24.000 --> 13:31.440
 that people don't really either know how to wear masks properly, or the masks that they are wearing

13:31.440 --> 13:36.720
 are not proper masks. So I understand the concern, right? The people don't wear their masks properly,

13:36.720 --> 13:43.280
 the masks are a different quality, but I do want to point out, Dr. Fauci, we all see him on TV,

13:43.280 --> 13:49.440
 we see our president, they're not wearing medical masks, they're wearing cloth masks. So I think

13:49.440 --> 13:56.160
 it's critical for messaging that we get on the same page with regard to our masks effective or not,

13:56.880 --> 14:03.280
 but maybe we haven't been doing enough education about how to wear those masks properly. So I'm

14:03.280 --> 14:08.480
 actually going to take a moment here, this will be my public service announcement on how do you wear

14:08.480 --> 14:15.600
 your mask properly? And I'm basically going to be sharing helpful CDC advice on how to improve

14:15.600 --> 14:21.200
 how your mask protects you and others. So I'm going to hit eight points here. So one,

14:21.200 --> 14:27.920
 make sure your mask fits snugly across your face. You should be breathing through your mask and not

14:27.920 --> 14:34.320
 around it, and please cover your nose. In my mind, if your nose is sticking out, you are not actually

14:34.320 --> 14:40.000
 wearing a mask. And I have a couple, you know, for those people watching, I have a couple masks

14:40.000 --> 14:43.680
 here to demonstrate. So I'm going to demonstrate that now. If you're listening, I'll describe it

14:43.680 --> 14:47.600
 for you. I'm going to put a mask on that will fit snugly against my face.

14:51.760 --> 14:56.880
 And I think people who are watching can see this is actually, I want to thank one of our listeners

14:56.880 --> 15:02.720
 who I believe this is handmade in Thailand. It's not important that your mask is completely symmetrical,

15:02.720 --> 15:08.320
 right? It's just important, right? I always get in trouble with that, trying to get my mask

15:08.320 --> 15:15.200
 symmetrical. But it has to fit. You want to use a nose piece if you can. So that's number number

15:15.200 --> 15:20.720
 three. So choose a mask with layers. I'm going to take this off now. You don't want to have just

15:20.720 --> 15:26.320
 one thin piece of fabric. You want to have layers. Also, some of these will actually have the ability

15:26.320 --> 15:32.880
 to put a filter in there. Three, choose a mask with a nose wire to improve the fit and bend that

15:32.880 --> 15:39.520
 wire over your nose to fit close to your face. Four, check your mask to make sure you feel warm

15:39.520 --> 15:45.840
 air coming through the mask, not out the sides, the top or the bottom. Five, if you have facial

15:45.840 --> 15:51.200
 hair, we're not sure how effective masks are. So trim that beard if you can. Consider double

15:51.200 --> 15:58.720
 masking. Consider shaving. Six, do not pull your mask down or out of the way to speak. And I want

15:58.720 --> 16:04.080
 to use this as an example. Again, you'll see, I saw this and I see this all the time. People put

16:04.080 --> 16:10.560
 their mask on and then they want to speak. So they either pull it away from their mouth or they pull

16:10.560 --> 16:17.120
 it down to speak. I think while we may have witnessed one of our elected officials, he needed to cough

16:17.120 --> 16:23.680
 or sneeze. He pulled off his mask, coughed into his hands, sneezed into his hands. I'm not sure

16:23.680 --> 16:29.200
 where he wiped them. But you do not take the mask off to cough or sneeze or talk. You want to have

16:29.200 --> 16:35.120
 it on specifically at those times. Also, don't take it off to yell at the athletes. That's another

16:35.120 --> 16:40.480
 one I see. Also, teachers, you did not take it off to have your students better understand what

16:40.480 --> 16:45.600
 you have to tell them. Seven, do not wear masks with one way valves. They only protect you and

16:45.600 --> 16:51.920
 not others. You are sending a very negative message. Eight, do wash your hands immediately

16:51.920 --> 16:57.200
 after removing a mask. Remember, this is supposed to protect you. So if it's actually protected you,

16:57.200 --> 17:02.960
 it is now potentially dirty. So take it off by the loops and then try to avoid contaminating

17:02.960 --> 17:09.840
 your hands. We also have some do knots from the CDC. Do not wear two disposable masks at the same

17:09.840 --> 17:16.080
 time. So if you're wearing those, those below mask, which are that charged fiber, these have been

17:16.080 --> 17:22.640
 studied one mask at a time not two. And this also applies to the issue of K and 95 or N 95s.

17:23.280 --> 17:27.920
 We are currently recommending not to cover those with a surgical mask. I have to say for my medical

17:27.920 --> 17:33.520
 colleagues, we got quite used to the fact that we were using surgical masks to protect and preserve

17:33.520 --> 17:40.960
 our N 95. So I know some of my colleagues still feel a little bit odd about that. So all right,

17:40.960 --> 17:48.560
 the pre exposure period. On April 13, we saw the article, physical inactivity is associated with

17:48.560 --> 17:56.080
 a higher risk for severe COVID-19 outcomes, a study in 48,440 adult patients. And this was

17:56.080 --> 18:04.880
 published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine. This might be a surprise that exercising might

18:04.880 --> 18:11.520
 have some health benefits. But I'm going to go out on a limb here. And what did these individuals

18:11.520 --> 18:19.200
 find? They found for those individuals who were consistently inactive, that they had a greater

18:19.200 --> 18:24.640
 risk of hospitalization. So these are individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 who were consistently

18:24.640 --> 18:34.000
 inactive. Their odds ratio of hospitalization was 2.26. Their admission to the ICU was 1.73

18:34.000 --> 18:39.840
 increased odds ratio. And their chance of death was 2.49. So almost twice as likely to die,

18:41.120 --> 18:46.960
 if they were diagnosed with COVID-19 ended up in the hospital. So basically, people who are

18:46.960 --> 18:54.000
 consistently inactive have a higher risk, at least per this study. So out on a limb, perhaps people

18:54.000 --> 19:00.000
 should exercise one more reason. Now we need a randomized control trial where half the people

19:00.000 --> 19:06.880
 exercise and the other half serves as the control to really determining if exercise is a good thing.

19:06.880 --> 19:10.960
 But I'm a little worried if we do this as a blind study, are people going to end up hurting

19:10.960 --> 19:15.520
 themselves? So somehow we have to have people exercising, not exercising, not aware of which

19:15.520 --> 19:22.160
 group they're in, and not wearing blindfolds. Testing. I think we're seeing an interesting

19:22.160 --> 19:27.920
 pattern here in our primary care and urgent cares where people are post vaccination. And they have

19:27.920 --> 19:34.400
 what seems like mild symptoms after a good COVID exposure, but yet there are antigen test

19:34.400 --> 19:40.640
 negative. So we may be seeing some of that sort of, you know, effective the vaccine

19:40.640 --> 19:46.880
 sort of below the radar of even getting positive testing. So when we have more information, I'll

19:46.880 --> 19:50.560
 make sure I share that. Active vaccination. Everyone's probably waiting for this.

19:50.560 --> 19:56.880
 I expect all our listeners are familiar with the J&J vaccine pause here in the US. And let me

19:56.880 --> 20:02.400
 just give everyone an update. I had the opportunity to be on the call today, where we got to run down

20:02.400 --> 20:08.960
 on what we know to date. So this is, this is, you know, hot off the press. So there were six

20:08.960 --> 20:15.680
 reports to the vaccine adverse event reporting system between March 19th and April 12th of women

20:15.680 --> 20:22.800
 between the ages of 18 and 48, having a rare clotting complication. So these individuals had

20:22.800 --> 20:30.000
 cavernous sinus thrombosis. This is a clotting of the vein complex inside your brain sort of,

20:30.000 --> 20:34.640
 you know, think about a few inches behind your eyeballs there. And they had platelet counts

20:34.640 --> 20:43.040
 less than 150,000 per millimeter acute. I do want to point out by comparison, we have seen

20:43.040 --> 20:52.320
 zero reports of this cavernous sinus thrombosis with rhombocytopenia in the 182 million doses

20:52.320 --> 20:58.160
 of mRNA vaccines given in the United States. So I know there's a little bit of, oh, this is just

20:58.160 --> 21:03.760
 something. But no, this looks like it is not a problem with the mRNA vaccine. So I want to make

21:03.760 --> 21:10.720
 that really clear on set. For these individuals, it was six to 13 days after vaccination. So this

21:10.720 --> 21:16.240
 sort of follows the timing. That's when we start to see the IgG or the immunoglobulin start to come

21:16.240 --> 21:24.320
 up, not necessarily just IgG. They were all Caucasian females, three out of the sixth were

21:24.320 --> 21:29.040
 three out of the six were obese. So half were obese, half were not. There were no known

21:29.040 --> 21:35.680
 coagulation disorders in this group of six women. Initially, headache was reported in five of the

21:35.680 --> 21:42.080
 six. The last person did not have a headache initially, but a headache soon developed. Their

21:42.080 --> 21:51.200
 initial presentation was backpaid. Now, half of the patients had clotting in other areas. So

21:51.200 --> 21:57.760
 lower extremities, the portal vein, pulmonary artery. And they were able to, and this is going

21:57.760 --> 22:02.960
 to be relevant as we go forward, they're able to test for something in anybody against platelet

22:02.960 --> 22:10.240
 factor four. And of the five that they were able to test, all of these antibody tests were positive.

22:10.800 --> 22:16.240
 One individual died. Two of them recovered and were discharged from the hospital. At the time of

22:16.240 --> 22:22.160
 the report that I got today, half of them were still in the hospital. A couple of conclusions,

22:22.800 --> 22:30.400
 the rate of this CVST does appear to be higher than would be expected for this observation period,

22:30.400 --> 22:36.880
 and in this particular demographic. I will also point out that in the phase three trial,

22:36.880 --> 22:47.600
 there was a 25 year old man who also developed CVST. And he also had positive anti-PF 480 bodies.

22:48.560 --> 22:54.240
 We still have a significant number of individuals that were just recently vaccinated. And so they

22:54.240 --> 23:01.920
 haven't passed through this, say, six to 13 days after vaccination. So we won't reach that until

23:01.920 --> 23:10.480
 April 25th. And at that point, we'll have a true number on what is the number of these

23:10.480 --> 23:14.960
 events that are happening after vaccination. There's a lot of speculation. I think there's

23:14.960 --> 23:21.280
 growing evidence that this may be a similar phenomenon to what we are seeing as a rare issue

23:21.280 --> 23:25.200
 with the AstraZeneca vaccine. And there were a couple publications in the New England Journal

23:25.200 --> 23:31.280
 of Medicine that shed some light on what might be happening there. And by comparison, I'll try to

23:31.280 --> 23:39.200
 get a connection here. So the original article, thrombotic thrombocytopenia after Chaddox 1,

23:40.160 --> 23:47.520
 and COVID-19 vaccination was published. And the authors report that of the 11 original patients,

23:47.520 --> 23:55.200
 nine were women, median age of 36, and a range of 22 to 49 years of age. Beginning

23:55.200 --> 24:01.440
 five to 16 days after vaccination, the patients presented with one or more thrombotic events

24:02.160 --> 24:07.680
 with the exception of one patient who actually presented with a fatal intracranial hemorrhage.

24:08.480 --> 24:14.160
 Of the patients with one or more thrombotic events, nine had cerebral venous thrombosis,

24:14.160 --> 24:20.320
 three had spanknic vein thrombosis, three had pulmonary embolism, four had other thrombosis,

24:20.320 --> 24:25.920
 and of these patients six died, five patients had disseminated intravascular coagulation.

24:26.720 --> 24:34.640
 Now the authors used a standard ELISA to detect these platelet activating antibodies against

24:34.640 --> 24:42.800
 PF4 and a modified PF4 enhanced platelet activation test to detect platelet activating antibodies

24:42.800 --> 24:49.520
 under various reaction conditions. Included in this testing were samples from patients who had blood

24:49.520 --> 24:55.760
 samples referred for investigation of these vaccine-associated thrombotic events with 28

24:55.760 --> 25:03.120
 testing positive on a screen. And so the authors suggest that we refer to this as vaccine-induced

25:03.120 --> 25:10.640
 immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia. So that, the ITT. Same addition, there was a brief report,

25:10.640 --> 25:18.320
 very similar name, thrombosis and thrombocytopenia after Chaddox1 and COVID-19 vaccination.

25:19.040 --> 25:25.360
 And they really came to the same conclusion. So what is going on here? What is this PF4?

25:26.160 --> 25:35.360
 So PF4 is platelet factor 4, or also known as chemokine CXCl4. It's a protein that's found in

25:35.360 --> 25:42.720
 the alpha granules of platelets. And it's involved in the clotting cascade. So we see a very similar

25:42.720 --> 25:47.280
 phenomenon rarely with a medicine we use called heparin. So it's very similar. You may have heard

25:47.280 --> 25:55.280
 the term hit or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. And what we're seeing here is really a consumption

25:56.240 --> 26:01.840
 of our platelets followed by, well, bleeding in one instance, but in most cases, clotting.

26:01.840 --> 26:08.800
 And we do feel, you know, I have to say, there is a smoking gun here. It looks like there is a

26:08.800 --> 26:13.760
 connection. It looks, and we will see the true numbers right now. We're talking about one in a

26:13.760 --> 26:20.640
 million. AstraZeneca is about one in 600,000. So as we go forward, we'll have to see what the

26:20.640 --> 26:25.520
 numbers are. Now, does it make sense for them to have pause from a scientific point of view? Yes.

26:25.520 --> 26:34.240
 If we are able to pause for another week or so, we will actually have that 13 days after the last

26:34.240 --> 26:39.840
 J&J was given in the US. We'll be able to see if there's any more of these events. And then we

26:39.840 --> 26:45.360
 can revisit this. And on the call today, they actually talked about several options here. One

26:45.360 --> 26:50.400
 was to just put this in context and say, okay, the rate is, let's say, 1,500,000, whatever they

26:50.400 --> 26:56.880
 want to say. There may be the ability to say, this is isolated to individuals under the age of 50.

26:56.880 --> 27:03.040
 This may be isolated to women. So there may may be discussions about what do we do at the vaccine

27:03.040 --> 27:08.800
 relative to restricting or targeting certain populations. So I think it's the right thing to

27:08.800 --> 27:14.720
 do. And I think it's also reassuring to see what a robust adverse event reporting system we had.

27:14.720 --> 27:18.240
 I know I think we had an email where someone asks like, you know, how many people need to die

27:18.240 --> 27:22.880
 before we'll find out about it? I think the answer, as I said, was 1, and that's what it was here.

27:23.920 --> 27:31.120
 We had a connection here. One person has died in the entire country. And this has been stopped

27:31.120 --> 27:36.320
 until we clarify the issue. Now, people will concern we're in the middle of a pandemic here.

27:36.320 --> 27:39.920
 Are we stopping our vaccination efforts? I'm going to give some reassurance to our listeners.

27:40.720 --> 27:47.520
 If you look at the number of vaccines that have been given so far, this makes up a small part

27:47.520 --> 27:54.800
 of the number of vaccines. As I mentioned, we have given almost 200 million doses of the Pfizer

27:54.800 --> 28:00.800
 and the Moderna vaccine. We have given less than 7 million of the J&J vaccine.

28:01.520 --> 28:06.880
 And going forward, if anything, we have a vaccine glut, especially getting sort of

28:06.880 --> 28:11.200
 looks from around the world. What are you doing with all those vaccines? We expect that we will

28:11.200 --> 28:18.800
 have the ability by May 31st to have enough vaccines to fully vaccinate 260 million Americans,

28:18.800 --> 28:24.000
 even without J&J being an option. So this was something that we could really do

28:24.880 --> 28:31.120
 without making any huge sacrifice or impact on our ongoing, really robust vaccination efforts.

28:31.120 --> 28:35.680
 So as we learn more, and I think by next week, we might have a little more information,

28:35.680 --> 28:39.520
 the following week, we should have all the information and know where we're headed with this

28:39.520 --> 28:46.400
 this challenge. Passive vaccination. We actually have some good news here. We are really moving

28:46.400 --> 28:54.720
 forward with monoclonal cocktails. And as well, as about a week ago, the NIH, the National Institute

28:54.720 --> 29:03.520
 of Health, is now recommending that monoclonals are part of the treatment. So they are now part

29:03.520 --> 29:10.400
 of the NIH's COVID-19 treatment guidelines. And so they are saying for a mile to moderate COVID-19,

29:11.040 --> 29:16.640
 who are at risk of worsening disease, they should be treated with monoclonal antibody

29:16.640 --> 29:22.880
 cocktail. So that's a pretty strong statement. So I feel bad. I feel like we fall down on the job

29:22.880 --> 29:29.280
 here sometimes. I have a couple instances happen. I have a gentleman right now in the ICU who will

29:29.280 --> 29:36.320
 probably die. And the situation here, he and his wife were diagnosed. They were offered monoclonals,

29:36.320 --> 29:42.000
 maybe not as persuasively as it should have been. The wife said certainly. Two days later,

29:42.000 --> 29:48.000
 she was fine. Symptoms resolved. The husband is now in the ICU on ventilator, week three. I don't

29:48.000 --> 29:52.640
 think he's going to make it. And that's the second of those stories in just a few weeks here that

29:52.640 --> 29:58.400
 I've experienced where two married couple are offered therapy. The wife, maybe women are smarter

29:58.400 --> 30:03.280
 than men. Just throwing that out there. Say, yes, the men decide they're going to just see how it goes.

30:04.800 --> 30:09.440
 It doesn't always go well. So okay. So what are the news? We've got a few more phase three trial

30:09.440 --> 30:17.200
 results. Phase three treatment trial in recently infected asympto, asymptomatic patients showed

30:17.200 --> 30:23.920
 regenoron coved. And this is Casa ribbon map with imdebemab significantly reduced progression

30:23.920 --> 30:31.200
 to symptomatic COVID-19. So this was another phase three trial. It enrolled 204 individuals

30:31.200 --> 30:39.520
 with any COVID-19 symptoms who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, but did not have antibodies at

30:39.520 --> 30:45.120
 baseline. And so they were randomized to either receive the regenoron cocktail or placebo. And

30:45.120 --> 30:52.800
 they reported that they reduced the overall risk of progression by 31% with a p-value of 0.038.

30:52.800 --> 30:59.600
 They also go on to report that the total number of weeks that patients experience symptoms which

30:59.600 --> 31:09.440
 decreased by 45% with the cocktail and the viral burden was reduced by more than 90%. So while

31:09.440 --> 31:15.200
 not included in the initial analysis plan, they also found that zero of the patients that got

31:15.840 --> 31:22.160
 the cocktail compared to six placebo patients ended up in the hospital or visited the ER during

31:22.160 --> 31:28.400
 this 29-day efficacy assessment period. And from a safety standpoint, there were no issues.

31:29.120 --> 31:35.520
 We also have a phase three prevention trial. And I think this is huge. It was an article

31:35.520 --> 31:40.960
 recently looking at people with immune compromise saying, what about these people? What they can't

31:40.960 --> 31:46.400
 actually respond well to a vaccine? Is there any way to passively protect them from the virus?

31:46.400 --> 31:53.840
 And so there was a phase three prevention trial showing 81% reduced risk of a symptomatic SARS-CoV-2

31:53.840 --> 32:01.200
 infections with subcutaneous administration of the regenoron cocktail. So this prevention trial

32:01.200 --> 32:08.160
 was a double-blind placebo-controlled trial assessing the effect of the regenoron cocktail

32:08.160 --> 32:14.640
 on uninfected individuals without SARS-CoV-2 antibodies or any symptoms who lived in the same

32:14.640 --> 32:21.200
 household as an individual who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 within a period of four days prior

32:21.200 --> 32:30.240
 to enrollment. So they enrolled 1,505 individuals, pretty much split one-to-one getting the cocktail

32:30.240 --> 32:36.000
 versus placebo. And then they followed them out. And remember, this is a subcutaneous injection.

32:36.000 --> 32:43.040
 This doesn't have to be IV. It's another way of improving access. They reported 72% protection

32:43.040 --> 32:50.160
 against symptomatic infections in the first week and 93% in subsequent weeks p-values with about

32:50.160 --> 32:55.600
 three zeros each after the decimal. They also reported, and I think this is important,

32:55.600 --> 33:01.040
 an impact on severity of disease. So for those who did go on to get infected,

33:01.040 --> 33:06.720
 on average, the individuals who were treated with the cocktails experienced a symptomatic infection

33:06.720 --> 33:12.720
 and their symptoms resolved in about a week compared to the placebo group who were sick

33:12.720 --> 33:20.400
 on average for three weeks. The infected individuals also cleared the virus faster. So there was a

33:20.400 --> 33:28.080
 significant reduction in the days with a high viral load by 90%. And again, from a safety point

33:28.080 --> 33:35.120
 of view, there were no concerns here. So what's the future with monoclonals? A couple things to

33:35.120 --> 33:39.760
 say here. Is there really this invariant region? And we can just target that if the spike could be

33:39.760 --> 33:45.680
 set forever? Can we make this perfect monoclonal and just sit on our laurels? I'm not sure that

33:45.680 --> 33:50.400
 that's true. I'm not sure that there is a part of the spike protein that does not vary.

33:51.600 --> 33:56.160
 Emailing with David Ho today who does not believe that there's actually a part of the spike that

33:57.040 --> 34:02.960
 cannot, will not change. So I think that this is going to be an ongoing challenge. And I've been

34:02.960 --> 34:07.280
 reaching out and communicating with my colleagues at UnitedHealth Group about how important it is

34:07.280 --> 34:13.440
 that we have regional guidance, regional access to the monoclonal cocktails, the monoclonal therapies

34:13.440 --> 34:19.920
 that work the best in a given region based upon which variants are circulating and what resistance

34:19.920 --> 34:26.480
 patterns they might have to the different monoclonal. So what's the best thing we can do to stay ahead

34:26.480 --> 34:32.960
 of the virus? It's to reduce the opportunity of the virus to replicate and change, which means

34:32.960 --> 34:38.560
 mitigation, means vaccination. Period of detectable viral replication, right? This is when that person

34:38.560 --> 34:43.280
 comes in positive. Just a little touch on here because I'm going to close with some discussion

34:43.280 --> 34:50.560
 of anticoagulation. At this point in time, we're basically saying we have no compelling evidence

34:50.560 --> 34:56.160
 that starting people on aspirin, starting people in anticoagulation is helpful. The first week of

34:56.160 --> 35:02.800
 illness is the time for monitoring and monoclonals. If they have a specific high risk feature, then,

35:02.800 --> 35:08.560
 of course, always use your judgment and the latest clinical data to recommend for your patients.

35:08.560 --> 35:14.560
 Their early inflammatory phase, remember that 94% is what we're worried about. So ideally,

35:14.560 --> 35:18.880
 we've got a lot of pulse oxes out there in the community. Remember, steroids are not during

35:18.880 --> 35:24.400
 the first week. It's during that second week, if needed. And I am going to comment here,

35:24.400 --> 35:28.960
 where are we with anticoagulation? Should they end up in the hospital? We are universally

35:28.960 --> 35:34.800
 recommending anticoagulation. And I'm going to skip here to the tail end because we're running

35:34.800 --> 35:42.320
 long and I apologize. But I just wanted to revisit the post discharge anticoagulation guidelines

35:42.320 --> 35:48.320
 because they have evolved over time. And currently, as per the NIH treatment guidelines,

35:48.320 --> 35:54.960
 prophylaxis after hospital discharge is not recommended for patients with COVID-19.

35:55.760 --> 36:00.960
 There's currently no ash guidelines addressing this issue. There will be, we're working on them.

36:00.960 --> 36:07.040
 But I think the consensus has been, as we look at the data, this population is not necessarily

36:07.040 --> 36:12.560
 at a higher risk of post discharge clotting complications than your general medical patient.

36:12.560 --> 36:18.720
 So use the same post discharge anticoagulation guidance you normally would. Person has cancer.

36:18.720 --> 36:24.560
 Person has a clotting propensity. Person has another indication. Go ahead, use anticoagulation.

36:24.560 --> 36:27.920
 But if they just came in the hospital for their five days of remdesivir,

36:28.720 --> 36:37.040
 for their 10 days of steroids, it may be that offering anticoagulation, the dox, the eliquis,

36:37.040 --> 36:44.080
 the zorrelto that may be doing more harm than good. So all right, I will conclude there.

36:44.080 --> 36:47.600
 And again, I want to thank everyone. We're just a couple of weeks here left in our American

36:47.600 --> 36:54.320
 Society of Tropical Medicine fundraiser. So take a deep breath, go to parasiteswithoutporters.com,

36:54.320 --> 36:59.840
 click that donate button, because we are going to, because they were hoping, I see we are going to

36:59.840 --> 37:07.920
 support the American Society of Tropical Medicine in creating three annual meeting travel awards

37:08.480 --> 37:14.000
 to bring early career women from economically challenged parts of the world to the annual

37:14.000 --> 37:20.480
 meeting this fall really helped do something to push their career forward and undo and address a

37:20.480 --> 37:24.640
 lot of the inequities that are here. So thank you very much again. Time for a couple of

37:24.640 --> 37:30.320
 questions for Daniel. You can send them to Daniel at microbe.tv. The first is from

37:30.320 --> 37:36.320
 Jay. My daughter has celiac disease, irritable bowel lactose intolerance and has migraines.

37:36.320 --> 37:40.880
 We were so happy when she managed to get the J&J vaccine. She suffered only mild chills

37:41.440 --> 37:46.640
 about to switch birth control for one that has no estrogen. But what does one need to be aware of

37:47.360 --> 37:52.160
 for symptoms? Yeah, yeah, that's actually interesting. You know, the, I'm not sure where

37:52.160 --> 37:56.800
 exactly the question is going, but I'll go with it anyway. My daughter actually sent me a graphic

37:56.800 --> 38:01.520
 looking at the risk of clotting complications with different therapies. And one of the things

38:01.520 --> 38:07.360
 in there was birth control, right? Birth control can actually increase a woman's risk

38:07.920 --> 38:14.400
 of having clotting issues. We definitely strongly recommend women on oral contraceptive pills do

38:14.400 --> 38:21.360
 not smoke. Smoking is another issue. You know, if we're concerned here about the J&J complications,

38:21.360 --> 38:26.320
 I will be reassuring. You know, we're looking at this being less than the risk of getting

38:26.320 --> 38:30.720
 struck by lightning, certainly much safer than driving to and from a vaccine appointment.

38:31.840 --> 38:37.760
 But everyone, it looks like either acutely came in with a severe headache or soon thereafter

38:37.760 --> 38:42.800
 developed headache. So we're advising people after the J&J vaccine across the board,

38:43.520 --> 38:48.880
 if you develop a severe headache, if you have trouble breathing, if you have abdominal pain,

38:48.880 --> 38:53.920
 then get evaluated. And we can actually do blood work. We can, we can sort out whether or not this

38:53.920 --> 38:59.840
 is a significant concern. I know we had a ton of individuals, the ERs, over the last couple days,

39:00.320 --> 39:04.880
 you know, worried about these issues. But again, this is very rare. So I really want to

39:04.880 --> 39:10.720
 reinforce that. There's no recommended treatment at this point. We're not recommending putting

39:10.720 --> 39:15.680
 an umbrella on aspirin or anticoagulation with an event as rare as this seems to be.

39:15.680 --> 39:19.760
 We're more likely to do harm than than anything beneficial.

39:19.760 --> 39:24.480
 All right, Mary writes in a recent clinical update, you said if a school plan results in lots of

39:24.480 --> 39:28.320
 potential exposure, then the plan is not a good one. The school needs a better plan.

39:28.320 --> 39:33.200
 I'm a high school teacher. We have been doing cohorted hybrid days in September. We're being

39:33.200 --> 39:38.560
 forced to come back full in person after a few weeks in a few weeks instead of 12 kids in a room

39:38.560 --> 39:44.640
 with six foot distancing will now have 25 to 28 kids in a room with three foot. The CDC guidelines

39:44.640 --> 39:49.920
 say anyone within six feet for more than 15 minutes would be considered a close contact would have

39:49.920 --> 39:54.560
 to quarantine. In that case, a single positive student in six classes throughout the day could

39:54.560 --> 40:00.080
 yield as many as 36 contacts in the building, given the limitations of space in our building

40:00.080 --> 40:04.400
 and the CDC guidelines on close contacts. I don't see how there could be a return to a school plan

40:04.400 --> 40:09.040
 that does not result in a lot of potential exposures. Do you have any advice on this?

40:09.040 --> 40:14.800
 This is an excellent question and I think hits right on what I talked about. A lot of parents

40:14.800 --> 40:19.760
 had this as a disconnect. You just told me that if the children are three feet apart and wearing

40:19.760 --> 40:26.000
 masks, that is not a risky behavior. But yet you're telling me that if the kids are three feet apart

40:26.000 --> 40:30.240
 and someone has COVID, if they're both wearing masks, it doesn't matter. It's an exposure. So

40:30.240 --> 40:35.040
 there really is a disconnect here. So I know some local health departments have worked with the

40:35.040 --> 40:40.560
 school and said, no, this doesn't make any sense. But this is reaching out to the CDC.

40:41.920 --> 40:46.160
 We need this guidance on a national level. I think it's great now that the CDC is here

40:47.200 --> 40:51.520
 sort of back giving us really helpful guidance. And I think it's just a matter of getting the

40:51.520 --> 40:56.960
 guidance updated to be consistent with what we now know. Mask wearing can be successfully

40:56.960 --> 41:02.960
 enforced in the schools. If the kids are wearing masks, if you as a teacher and the kids are wearing

41:02.960 --> 41:09.680
 a mask and you're keeping this separation, this is a very low risk activity. Also go get vaccinated,

41:09.680 --> 41:14.720
 right? That's that's one of the biggest things we can do here. And if you look at our high schools,

41:14.720 --> 41:22.160
 a chunk of the kids, right, or 60 and 17. So the more people you get vaccinated, the better,

41:22.160 --> 41:27.520
 good ventilation systems, three feet is going to give you that 80% reduction. You throw a mask on

41:27.520 --> 41:32.720
 either side of that three feet. Yeah, otherwise, I think your math is exactly what I worry about.

41:33.440 --> 41:37.440
 You know, one child, six different periods, every time they're sitting surrounded by eight

41:37.440 --> 41:42.400
 kids. Next thing you know, everyone's in quarantine. We were only in school for a day.

41:42.400 --> 41:49.520
 One more from Ellen who talks about the discussion we had about pulling back on the

41:50.080 --> 41:55.680
 I am injection for the vaccine. And she has a question, which is what might be the consequences

41:55.680 --> 42:01.680
 of inadvertent IV administration of the vaccine? Someone I know came to me with a concern that

42:01.680 --> 42:06.880
 one of the vaccines he gave did, in fact, go IV, which he believes based on feel of having hit a

42:06.880 --> 42:13.040
 vessel by followed by continuing to inject before his brain and muscles had time to react to this

42:13.040 --> 42:17.520
 unexpected sensation. I realize there's no data, but would appreciate thoughts on what would be

42:17.520 --> 42:23.440
 theoretically expected in this case. The vaccine in question was MRNA. But I suppose in either case,

42:23.440 --> 42:28.160
 we would have the recipe for spike protein, as I call it, within circulation. Would this lead to

42:28.160 --> 42:33.760
 uptake and spike production within the vessels? If so, could this be related to rare clotting

42:33.760 --> 42:39.040
 issues seen with AZ and now J and J? And would it move out of the bloodstream and be used in a

42:39.040 --> 42:45.200
 similar but less localized way than in IM? Your insight is always much appreciated.

42:46.640 --> 42:52.720
 Yes, I am speculating here, but I will share like what my experience. So, you know, I was doing a

42:52.720 --> 42:57.920
 lot of vaccines this last week. We did over 300 last week. We actually did over 100 J and J just

42:57.920 --> 43:05.360
 Friday, right before the pause was triggered. And, you know, I always ask the people before I give

43:05.360 --> 43:10.720
 them a shot, I say, oh, are you a bleeder? And one of my partners, Nujali, who I mentioned earlier,

43:10.720 --> 43:15.520
 she was like, well, why do you do that? And some people, you give them a shot and they bleed.

43:15.520 --> 43:19.760
 The majority of the people we are giving these shots to, when you're done, they don't even need

43:19.760 --> 43:24.320
 a bandaid. They're fine. But a certain percent of them will bleed. Sometimes it prompts them to let

43:24.320 --> 43:28.480
 me know that they're on a blood thinner or something like that. But sometimes you do the shot and

43:28.480 --> 43:32.560
 actually they really start bleeding and you have to apply pressure and put a bandaid, which is not

43:32.560 --> 43:38.480
 consistent with this concept that we have been told that the deltoid, there's no blood vessels

43:38.480 --> 43:45.600
 there. It's very small capillaries. There is some vascularity to a deltoid, particularly in

43:45.600 --> 43:51.840
 someone who's maybe more active, et cetera. So I don't think we're quite clear on what's going on

43:51.840 --> 43:56.320
 here. You know, significant bleeding sometimes in some of these individuals suggesting a larger

43:56.320 --> 44:00.880
 vessel than, you know, we've sort of been led to believe when we talk about the pulling back the

44:00.880 --> 44:07.200
 plunger. But let's move on to the next level. The issues that we're seeing do not appear to be

44:07.200 --> 44:12.880
 that the vaccine is nestled in the blood system. What we're actually seeing is an immune response.

44:12.880 --> 44:19.280
 We're seeing six to 13 days later. We're seeing antibody production. These antibodies are against

44:19.280 --> 44:26.320
 a certain target, PF4, so platelet factor four. I don't necessarily think getting in the circulation

44:26.320 --> 44:32.960
 explains it. If anything, a good robust immune response is what explains this. So I understand

44:32.960 --> 44:38.320
 the concept of pulling back on the plunger, but I'm not sure I would understand the mechanism.

44:38.320 --> 44:44.240
 That's COVID-19 clinical update number 58 with Dr. Daniel Griffin. Thanks again, Daniel.

44:44.240 --> 45:11.280
 Oh, thank you so much, and everyone be safe.
