 This week in virology, the podcast about viruses, the kind that make you sick.

00:10.320 --> 00:20.240
 From Microbe TV, this is Twib, this week in virology, episode 713 recorded on January 29,

00:20.240 --> 00:27.360
 2021. I'm Vincent Rackeniello, and you're listening to the podcast all about viruses.

00:27.360 --> 00:33.360
 Joining me today from New York, Daniel Griffin. Hello, everyone.

00:33.360 --> 00:41.440
 How'd your immunization go, Daniel? It went incredibly well. We're getting consistently 12

00:41.440 --> 00:46.880
 doses per vial, so actually it got even a little bit extra last night. I was able to,

00:46.880 --> 00:53.120
 with five vials, vaccinate 62 people. Wow, good job. There's something for me like,

00:53.120 --> 00:57.120
 I am exhausted, but then I vaccinate that many people, and I'm full of all this energy. I can't

00:57.120 --> 01:03.520
 sleep. I just like settle down. It's okay. Nice. Very good. But all right, we got a lot to cover

01:03.520 --> 01:10.240
 today. So let me start with my quotation. There are no problems, only solutions. And I think that's

01:10.240 --> 01:17.120
 from a song by John Lennon. All right, I have my three rules, and I keep updating these. Never

01:17.120 --> 01:24.320
 miss an opportunity to vaccinate, never miss an opportunity to test, and never waste a vaccine dose.

01:25.360 --> 01:31.520
 My view is every vaccine dose is a chance to save a life. So we got to get those into arms.

01:31.520 --> 01:37.520
 So we have a lot of exciting new information to share. So start with active vaccination.

01:37.520 --> 01:44.800
 So a quick update on the Novavax protein-based vaccine candidate. We have some interim analysis

01:44.800 --> 01:49.600
 in the form of a press release. So because we're getting used to that. And it's sort of funny

01:49.600 --> 01:56.800
 because you read it through and obviously the PR department was involved. So what is this Novavax

01:56.800 --> 02:06.240
 vaccine? So it contains a full-length, pre-fusion spike protein made using the Novavax recombinant

02:06.240 --> 02:11.440
 nanoparticle technology. Now I'm not getting paid by them. And the company's proprietary

02:11.440 --> 02:18.240
 saponin-based matrix M adjuvant. Basically what they do is they've got the they've got the

02:18.240 --> 02:24.080
 spike protein that they purify. It's made in insect cells, which is actually kind of interesting

02:24.080 --> 02:30.080
 because you know I know my two daughters are pretty much vegan. So this might be something they can

02:30.080 --> 02:36.480
 use. There's no replication. It's really just the protein. And think of it as like a flower,

02:36.480 --> 02:42.480
 right? With the spikes all sticking out from the center. And this study enrolled over 15,000

02:42.480 --> 02:49.520
 participants from 18 to 84 years of age. About a quarter of them were over the age of 65.

02:50.560 --> 02:57.760
 And the primary endpoint was PCR confirmed, symptomatic mild moderate or severe COVID-19.

02:58.560 --> 03:03.680
 And it had to be seven days after the second study vaccination. So this is something we're

03:03.680 --> 03:08.160
 going to talk about. When do you start looking? When do you say it's time to judge the efficacy?

03:08.960 --> 03:13.440
 So I would say seven days seems to me a little bit early. But I think they were very confident.

03:13.440 --> 03:18.960
 They wanted to kind of get some data out here. And the preliminary data suggested that the

03:18.960 --> 03:25.280
 Novavax protein-based vaccine efficacy, and they break it down by strain, right? So it's calculated

03:25.280 --> 03:38.000
 to be 95.6% efficacy against the original COVID-19 strain, 85.6% against the UK variant strain,

03:38.720 --> 03:45.600
 but only 50% against the South African strain. We'll talk a little bit more about the terminology

03:45.600 --> 03:49.840
 strain and variant, but that's what they're saying. This first interim analysis was based

03:49.840 --> 03:58.880
 only on 62 cases, right? So this is a preliminary interim analysis. 56 of those cases of COVID-19

03:58.880 --> 04:05.600
 were in the placebo group. Six of them were in the people that got this protein-based vaccine.

04:06.480 --> 04:13.040
 So overall, you had an efficacy of about 89.3%. There was only one severe case, and that was in

04:13.040 --> 04:20.560
 the placebo group. So we're starting to see this consistent, really good efficacy if your end point

04:20.560 --> 04:25.120
 is keeping people from ending up with severe COVID, keeping people from dying from COVID.

04:25.760 --> 04:30.400
 And this is one of, I'll say, tried-and-true technology, right? This is the vaccine technology

04:30.400 --> 04:38.560
 that's used for the new shingrix, the new shingles shot. So more to come. Also, my gosh,

04:38.560 --> 04:43.920
 this was vaccine day. So maybe I forgot to give my, you know, get off the flight if you don't

04:43.920 --> 04:48.720
 want to hear about vaccines. This is not for you. Spend your time somewhere else. You know,

04:48.720 --> 04:55.760
 if you want to send those angry emails, anti-vaxx, or emails at peterhotes.com, I think is where you

04:55.760 --> 05:01.920
 send us. J&J vector vaccine. So I've been waiting for this. I thought I was going to have to wait

05:01.920 --> 05:08.320
 till Tuesday. So I was excited to have this come out. We keep getting these questions,

05:08.320 --> 05:13.360
 and I think I was joking with one of my colleagues today. When is the normal vaccine coming out?

05:13.360 --> 05:18.960
 When's the one we just get one shot and you're done? And so, yes, we're getting information here.

05:18.960 --> 05:25.680
 So J&J reported that they had met their primary end points in the interim analysis of phase 3.

05:25.680 --> 05:29.440
 And again, we got a press release. So we're going to get peer reviewed. We're going to get

05:29.440 --> 05:36.160
 more data. And this is going to go, we think, to the FDA soon. Safety and efficacy data based on

05:36.160 --> 05:46.480
 43,783 participants. And here we have 468 symptomatic cases. So this is pretty robust data.

05:47.440 --> 05:52.080
 So many more cases, you know, here, compared to some of the other ones, right? We were talking

05:52.080 --> 06:00.720
 about 100, 118 or so. Here, we have data four weeks after vaccination. And I do want to remind

06:00.720 --> 06:06.720
 people that what we learned about from the J&J vaccine, it really takes about eight weeks to get

06:06.720 --> 06:15.600
 those antibodies up at 100% of people. So what's the data going to be here? So J&J vaccine,

06:16.160 --> 06:23.280
 they report was 85% effective in preventing severe disease across all regions studied,

06:23.280 --> 06:27.600
 right? So I'm sort of pointing out that's what we're really concerned about. You know, if someone

06:27.600 --> 06:32.960
 gets a little bit of the sniffles and more or less or the mild disease, so looking at keeping people

06:32.960 --> 06:39.040
 from ending up with severe disease, keeping people from dying 85% efficacy in all the regions studied

06:39.040 --> 06:45.840
 as early as 28 days. And then efficacy against severe disease increased over time to 100%

06:47.040 --> 06:53.200
 at day 49, so about seven weeks. So we're only seeing very limited information in this press

06:53.200 --> 06:59.440
 release. I'll get back to this when we get more. But what's exciting here is this is an inexpensive,

06:59.440 --> 07:04.160
 it's established vaccine technology that's been used hundreds of thousands of people have received

07:04.160 --> 07:10.000
 vaccines with this technology. Basically, the safety data, there was nothing, nothing there.

07:10.560 --> 07:14.640
 The reactogenicity profile, this is kind of what people were saying. I want to get a shot like

07:14.640 --> 07:19.440
 the flu shot, where the only reason I know I got it is because someone poked me with a needle and

07:19.440 --> 07:25.440
 they put a sticker on my card or something. But we're going to get more data as we go forward.

07:25.440 --> 07:32.720
 But I have to say it was nice to get this data this morning. Before I do FAQs on vaccines,

07:32.720 --> 07:36.480
 frequently asked questions, I really want to get a little bit into the weeds. And I was

07:36.480 --> 07:41.120
 one of my people that, you know, primary for me, the way this started was using this as a chance to

07:41.120 --> 07:46.880
 get all the tri-state physicians that Pro Health New York and other physicians, Riverside

07:46.880 --> 07:53.040
 and Pro Health Connecticut providers up to speed on what we need to know. But I'm going to call

07:53.040 --> 07:58.160
 this part here. I'm going to call it the Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders approach. You need a plan,

07:58.160 --> 08:02.160
 you need to make sure everyone gets the vaccine. But I'm also going to call it the Biden

08:02.160 --> 08:09.200
 Buttigieg vaccines for everyone who wants them only at this point. Before you order any vaccines,

08:09.840 --> 08:12.960
 you want to have a vaccine reaction kit. You know, you want to have your Benadryl,

08:12.960 --> 08:17.920
 you want to have your epinephrine, and then you want to have a plan. If you're going to be opening

08:17.920 --> 08:22.960
 a bio, you're going to get 10, 11 or 12 doses, you want to make sure you have a plan for who's

08:22.960 --> 08:28.000
 going to get those. And you also want to have a plan for what if someone has a reaction, you know,

08:28.000 --> 08:33.680
 with the mRNA vaccines, about 1 in 100,000 people are having reactions, you want to have a plan for

08:33.680 --> 08:39.040
 what you're going to do. So let's go through. Part of this, I'll say, you know, conversations

08:39.040 --> 08:43.440
 with people and one of the nurses I've been working with was saying, you know, actually just a week

08:43.440 --> 08:48.000
 ago, when we started doing some re vaccinations, you know, we're thinking about getting this in

08:48.000 --> 08:52.640
 the office, but you know, we just don't have a freezer, so we're not sure. And so let's go through. You

08:52.640 --> 08:59.120
 don't need a freezer, you need arms. The Moderna, it arrives frozen. So you just put in the refrigerator,

08:59.120 --> 09:04.640
 yes, a normal medical office refrigerator, and it can stay in there for up to 30 days.

09:04.640 --> 09:10.400
 I'm not sure there's any reason with the supply relative demand that any vaccine should sit for

09:10.400 --> 09:16.480
 30 days in that fridge, but it can. No freezer required. Once in the refrigerator, just leave it

09:16.480 --> 09:22.400
 there. Don't put it back in the freezer. It can couple hours and it'll defrost in the refrigerator,

09:22.400 --> 09:26.240
 but if you're ready to start vaccinating, you can just take it out, let it sit at room temperature.

09:26.240 --> 09:30.400
 For an hour, it's ready to go. Once it's been in the fridge, you only need about 15 minutes out

09:30.400 --> 09:37.040
 before you're ready to go. So once you pull out the vial, again, reinforce, have a plan.

09:37.840 --> 09:41.920
 If you've got 10 people scheduled and only age show up, have a plan for what you're going to do

09:41.920 --> 09:47.440
 with those last two. If you've got a couple doses, have a call, have a call list and plan, like,

09:47.440 --> 09:51.840
 don't be like, Oh my gosh, I got to leave at nine for some important date. Don't let those vaccines

09:51.840 --> 09:57.520
 go to waste, have a plan. Call on the phone, make sure people are going to come. Once you pull that

09:57.520 --> 10:03.600
 vial out of the refrigerator, we're talking about Moderna here, you have 12 hours, just keeping that

10:03.600 --> 10:10.240
 at room temperature. Once you puncture the vial, you have six hours puncture the vial. You've got

10:10.240 --> 10:16.240
 your syringes ready to go use one ml syringes. I've been posting on Twitter. And if anyone

10:16.240 --> 10:20.800
 follow me on Twitter and you'll get my posting on sort of the weeds here, which are the best syringes

10:20.800 --> 10:26.160
 to buy, which are the ones so that you get 12 doses per vial instead of 10. That's a 20%

10:26.160 --> 10:32.480
 increase in the number of doses. That's huge. And once you once you put these shots in arms,

10:32.480 --> 10:38.160
 you observe people for 15 minutes. It doesn't have to be one person at a time. You can actually

10:38.160 --> 10:45.200
 look at multiple people at the same time. So often last night, we did, as I mentioned, 62 individuals.

10:45.840 --> 10:50.000
 This is actually, for a lot of us, the biggest logistical challenge, where do all those people

10:50.000 --> 10:54.800
 wait so you can keep an eye on them? Most people were telling them, set your iPhone,

10:54.800 --> 11:00.800
 set your smartphone. It's okay if you have an Android. For 15 minutes, when your alarm goes off,

11:00.800 --> 11:06.960
 that's great. A little bit of an oddity. The expiration date is not on the bottles or the box.

11:06.960 --> 11:12.960
 You actually have to go to the website and input the lot number. And then you get this date,

11:12.960 --> 11:17.600
 and you get the expiration date. So a little bit odd. But listen, you don't need a freezer.

11:17.600 --> 11:22.080
 All you need is a medical grade refrigerator. Well, what about Pfizer? Oh my gosh, that's

11:22.080 --> 11:28.000
 the ultra cold, right? That's these thermal shippers. It arrives frozen and it can stay frozen in

11:28.000 --> 11:33.760
 that thermal shipper for up to 30 days. All you have to do is add a little bit of dry ice every

11:33.760 --> 11:40.880
 five days. If you take those vials out, you can put them in a normal refrigerator and they can

11:40.880 --> 11:44.880
 sit in that refrigerator for up to five days. When they're in that nation, be sitting in that

11:44.880 --> 11:49.600
 fridge for up to five days, right? Because we should be getting those into arms. So it's painful to

11:49.600 --> 11:55.760
 say, but you can actually keep those for 35 days from the time you receive the thermal shipper,

11:55.760 --> 11:59.760
 right? Every five days, you're adding some dry ice. And at the very end, you put them in the

11:59.760 --> 12:04.800
 fridge for the last five days. Once you put them in the refrigerator, it takes a couple hours to

12:04.800 --> 12:09.840
 thaw. So give yourself an amount of time, you know, and pull them straight out of the freezer.

12:09.840 --> 12:14.640
 If you put them at room temperature, about 30 minutes. But once once they're thawed, you can

12:14.640 --> 12:18.880
 pull them out. Once you pull them out, you have about two hours before you do the dilution. And

12:18.880 --> 12:23.840
 again, you're going to run into that same once you've diluted them, you're going to get six doses

12:23.840 --> 12:29.520
 per vial. If you use the proper syringes, you've got six hours once you mix them up, load your

12:29.520 --> 12:35.520
 syringes ready to go. All right, now we've got our FAQs. Some of these are fun. I have to say,

12:35.520 --> 12:40.240
 I'm entertained by the questions. But some of them actually speak to a little bit of, I'm going to

12:40.240 --> 12:47.600
 say carelessness. What do we do if a person gets a vaccine and they feel crummy for one day,

12:47.600 --> 12:52.800
 for two days, for three days? That's a magic rule. We have been noticing, unfortunately,

12:52.800 --> 12:58.080
 that some people come in, and they actually have already been exposed. And on day three,

12:58.080 --> 13:03.440
 they're still feeling crummy. At that point is when you say we can't just chalk this all up to

13:03.440 --> 13:08.400
 react to genicity. And you want to do that COVID test. We've actually had some individuals,

13:08.400 --> 13:12.000
 actually several times this has happened. We were talking about this in the urgent care call,

13:12.000 --> 13:18.640
 where the whole family comes in. And then they all are there to get vaccinated and turns out

13:18.640 --> 13:24.000
 someone in the group feels crummy, comes back later that day or the next day, and then tests

13:24.000 --> 13:30.560
 positive. So the rule we're using, test as often as you can. This is an opportunity to test.

13:31.120 --> 13:36.000
 We know five to 10% of people that are getting tested are coming back positive. So think about,

13:36.000 --> 13:41.600
 you know, you open two vials, probably one or two people are that you're vaccinating is already

13:41.600 --> 13:45.760
 positive. They want to know that so that they don't spread it to their families. We can prevent

13:45.760 --> 13:52.080
 infections. Once they get the vaccine, 48 hours is typical. If they're feeling crummy at day three,

13:52.080 --> 13:56.960
 then you want to evaluate why are they feeling crummy may not be from the vaccine. All right,

13:56.960 --> 14:03.920
 I got vaccinated, but my antibody test came back negative. Okay, this is Twiv. So you're going to

14:03.920 --> 14:10.000
 get a little bit of nitty gritty science here. When you're getting vaccinated, you are getting

14:10.000 --> 14:15.760
 the spike protein so that you can make antibodies against the spike protein. Now,

14:15.760 --> 14:22.000
 the end protein is actually the most abundantly produced immunodominant protein. So most of

14:22.000 --> 14:26.800
 those tests out there, those serology tests, like the Roche, for instance, they're testing

14:26.800 --> 14:32.400
 for antibodies against the end protein. So let's think about it. If I give you spike protein and

14:32.400 --> 14:37.120
 you make antibodies against the spike protein, but I send you for a test looking for antibodies

14:37.120 --> 14:42.240
 against the end protein, the nucleocapsid protein, it's going to come back negative.

14:43.200 --> 14:48.160
 So just to throw it out there, we do not recommending checking serologies. We certainly

14:48.160 --> 14:54.000
 don't recommend checking the wrong serologies. So if you do want to check serologies for some

14:54.000 --> 14:58.400
 crazy reason, send them to someone with a little bit of a sophisticated understanding.

14:58.400 --> 15:06.480
 And then they're going to need a quantitative S protein antibody test. Do I still need to wear

15:06.480 --> 15:12.720
 a mask if all my friends have been vaccinated? And so this is this quarantine issue. And I ran

15:12.720 --> 15:19.120
 into my buddy Jay Burger the other day, and I ran the scenario by him. I said, so Jay, you know,

15:19.120 --> 15:25.440
 I know you want to hang out with me. But what if this? What if you and I and our buddy Conan,

15:25.440 --> 15:29.360
 we get together because Conan bought a liquor store and he's going to treat us to this great

15:29.360 --> 15:34.880
 new scotch. And we sit around and we've got our masks off because we've all been vaccinated and

15:34.880 --> 15:41.680
 we're so excited. And then Conan ends up getting a test the next day because his mother-in-law is

15:41.680 --> 15:47.040
 coming to visit and he's positive. I'm like, Jay, you and I, we're quarantined, we're out of work.

15:48.000 --> 15:53.840
 So that's that's part of the issue. We do not know if people who've been vaccinated,

15:53.840 --> 15:58.720
 we don't know about transmission yet. We really need to know about that. Why are health care workers

15:58.720 --> 16:04.560
 not required to get vaccinated? If people listened to the previous twin with Dixon,

16:04.560 --> 16:10.080
 he was getting pretty emotional about this. He obviously feels really strong about this,

16:10.080 --> 16:15.840
 but where are we with the science? So Dixon was suggesting, and this gets back almost to that first

16:15.840 --> 16:21.440
 question that we just talked about. Dixon suggested that an unvaccinated person was more likely to

16:21.440 --> 16:28.400
 transmit the virus to others or the corollary that vaccination reduces the chances of transmission

16:28.400 --> 16:33.600
 by a person who's been vaccinated. Now here we actually need to stop and say that we do not know

16:33.600 --> 16:38.960
 the answer to this question, but we really do need to know the answer to this question. So we have

16:38.960 --> 16:44.720
 very limited data from the vaccine trials with PCR surveillance in hundreds, not thousands of

16:44.720 --> 16:52.000
 participants suggesting there may be a reduction in infection and potential transmission. We still

16:52.000 --> 16:58.000
 did not know if our current vaccines prevent viral transmission. There was a plan to do a major

16:58.000 --> 17:03.600
 study on transmission with the Moderna vaccine led by Larry Corey, a virologist at Fred Hutch,

17:03.600 --> 17:08.320
 Cancer Center in Seattle, but they did not get the federal funds. And currently my understanding

17:08.320 --> 17:14.480
 is that the study is not going forward. The other issue is that these vaccines are not FDA

17:14.480 --> 17:19.680
 approved. So even if we knew the answer to the first question, which I am hopefully we will get

17:19.680 --> 17:26.240
 the answer to about transmission, there's a major issue mandating something that's not FDA approved.

17:26.240 --> 17:33.600
 So throw that out there. What about these syringes with less dead space? What is that? I think Rich

17:33.600 --> 17:38.720
 was talking about that. So I've been tweeting a bunch about this for a while. If you use the

17:38.720 --> 17:46.800
 right syringes, you get an extra 20%. So Pfizer, five doses, if they send out their

17:47.680 --> 17:54.160
 vials with the right syringes that do get six doses, then they count it as six. If they're sent

17:54.160 --> 17:59.520
 out with the crummy syringes, they don't get the count extra. Same with Moderna. I guess I'll say

17:59.520 --> 18:04.400
 the same with Moderna right now is sending out with the idea that there are 10 doses per

18:04.400 --> 18:09.760
 file. But again, if you use the right syringes, you can get 12, maybe even sometimes more. So

18:10.400 --> 18:14.880
 this is not common knowledge, I have to say. So if you're thinking about vaccinating,

18:14.880 --> 18:19.520
 you're moving forward with vaccinating, reach out, get some guidance, use the right syringes

18:19.520 --> 18:25.040
 because 10 to 20% extra vaccine, that really adds up. Instead of 10 million vaccines,

18:25.040 --> 18:30.560
 you got an extra one or two million thrown on top. All right, what about school openings?

18:30.560 --> 18:37.440
 I always get in trouble when I talk about this. The MMWR early release came out on the 26

18:37.440 --> 18:46.800
 one slash 26 slash 2021 COVID-19 cases and transmission in 17 K through 12 schools in Wisconsin.

18:47.440 --> 18:54.480
 So the study involved students, staff members in 17 K through 12 schools in rural Wisconsin,

18:54.480 --> 19:00.960
 under the district and statewide mask mandates, and they found that the teachers in the study

19:00.960 --> 19:08.240
 reported the students had very high masking compliance. And so despite widespread community

19:08.240 --> 19:14.320
 transmission, the rates in the schools, 37% lower than in the surrounding community.

19:14.960 --> 19:22.640
 A couple things I want to say, the mask use was reported at greater than 92%. They were using

19:22.640 --> 19:28.640
 11 to 20 student cohorts. They were doing physical distancing. They were doing the quarantine

19:28.640 --> 19:35.200
 after exposures. And of note, they received funds from a foundation to support this strategy. So

19:36.080 --> 19:41.120
 we all want our kids to go to school, but we want the kids. We want the teachers. We want

19:41.120 --> 19:46.160
 everyone, all the staff involved to be safe. This takes planning. It takes the strategy. It takes

19:46.160 --> 19:52.240
 money. You can't just make it happen. Incubation period post exposure. I just always want to

19:52.240 --> 19:56.480
 remind everyone that test doesn't predict the future. So don't go have a test and then think

19:56.480 --> 20:01.520
 that you don't have to worry. If you're in the incubation period, a test can be negative today.

20:01.520 --> 20:06.160
 It can turn positive tomorrow. Now we have some more. A lot of exciting data this week,

20:06.160 --> 20:14.960
 passive vaccination. So monoclonal antibodies for COVID. So from Eli Lilly, we have the paper SARS,

20:14.960 --> 20:22.080
 COVID-2, neutralizing antibody, LY, COVID-50, 555, and now patients with COVID-19 in the Newland

20:22.080 --> 20:29.680
 Journal. That was 75% reduction in COVID-19. That was the Blaze 1 study. From Regeneron,

20:29.680 --> 20:34.640
 we had the original paper in the New England Journal. The Regeneron, COVID-2, and neutralizing

20:34.640 --> 20:41.600
 antibody cocktail with a 50% reduction. And then we recently discussed the Blaze 2 study

20:41.600 --> 20:47.040
 where bamlin imamab decreased infections by 80% in long-term care facility residents.

20:47.680 --> 20:51.760
 And the only deaths were in the placebo arm. This is when we were doing it pre-exposure.

20:52.320 --> 20:56.800
 But we got a couple new things today. So we have cocktail data from Eli Lilly.

20:57.840 --> 21:03.840
 And this was the effect of bamlin imamab as monotherapy or in combination with

21:04.560 --> 21:09.360
 a test of a map. Now they should have thrown an L and it could have been a Tesla the map,

21:09.360 --> 21:14.960
 but it's not. It would have solved better, I think, on viral load in patients with mild and moderate

21:14.960 --> 21:22.880
 COVID-19. So really what this was is they continued sort of a second part of the Blaze 1 study data.

21:23.920 --> 21:29.840
 And they were looking at the proportion of patients with COVID-19 related hospitalizations

21:29.840 --> 21:40.480
 or ED visits, 5.8% for placebo, 0.9% for the cocktail. So an 84% reduction in COVID-19 related

21:40.480 --> 21:46.800
 hospitalizations or ED visits. There are no deaths in the study, so we can't really assess that as well.

21:47.920 --> 21:53.520
 Regeneron has got more to tell us, more another press release about their cocktail.

21:53.520 --> 22:00.480
 And this is using the cocktail to prevent you from getting COVID-19. And who wouldn't want

22:00.480 --> 22:08.560
 to have a cocktail and not get COVID-19? So they looked at 400 individuals. They were randomized

22:08.560 --> 22:16.400
 to receive the passive immunization with the Regeneron COVID-2 cocktail. And this was subcutaneous,

22:16.400 --> 22:24.000
 right? So what we hear from this press release is passive vaccination with the Regeneron cocktail

22:24.000 --> 22:31.840
 resulted in a 100% prevention of symptomatic infection and a 50% lower rate of any infection

22:31.840 --> 22:35.760
 at all. And there actually are some pretty exciting things I'm going to go through here.

22:36.560 --> 22:41.600
 So the lower number of infections that did happen in the Regeneron COVID-2 therapy,

22:41.600 --> 22:46.880
 they were all asymptomatic. So right, 100% prevention of symptomatic in this study. The

22:46.880 --> 22:54.800
 infections that did occur in the placebo group had on average more than 100 fold higher peak viral

22:54.800 --> 23:02.320
 load in the placebo group than in the vaccinated group. So two log difference. The infections that

23:02.320 --> 23:08.720
 did happen in the people that got the cocktail, none of them lasted more than a week where the

23:08.720 --> 23:14.640
 people in the placebo group, 40% of them were lasting three to four weeks. No infected individuals

23:15.600 --> 23:23.440
 in the cocktail group had viral loads above 10 to the fourth compared to about 62% in the placebo

23:23.440 --> 23:29.920
 group. So Regeneron COVID-2 cocktail, given ahead of time, was associated with fewer total viral

23:29.920 --> 23:36.720
 shedding weeks, fewer total high viral shedding weeks. So for a recap, the data on the monoclonal

23:36.720 --> 23:43.120
 is pre exposure. We have it post exposure. You don't want to give it late. You want to give it early.

23:43.120 --> 23:47.600
 And here, I think you're seeing some sort of interesting suggestion that 10 to the fourth,

23:47.600 --> 23:52.640
 we're actually thinking that may be below the level of transmission. So people who get high

23:52.640 --> 23:56.480
 antibodies, whether they're being given in a cocktail or we're hoping with vaccines,

23:56.480 --> 24:02.080
 we are hoping that even if they get infected, that it's going to be resulting in interruption

24:02.080 --> 24:07.520
 of transmission. All right, now this, I was so excited about this, but then I became less excited

24:07.520 --> 24:12.720
 and then less excited. So this was the Cole Corona study, which we finally saw as a pre-print.

24:13.440 --> 24:18.240
 And some really clever person did a little tweet. And they've got like this really like

24:18.240 --> 24:24.640
 muscle bound ripped man. And that was the press release. And then they had the abstract,

24:24.640 --> 24:28.880
 which was a guy who maybe hadn't been hitting the gym quite as often. And then they had the

24:28.880 --> 24:32.800
 results. And it was a guy with the belly hanging over the belt. And that's kind of how I'm feeling

24:32.800 --> 24:38.880
 here. So this was a study looking at the efficacy of culture scene in non hospitalized patients with

24:38.880 --> 24:44.720
 COVID-19. And as mentioned, we're looking at a pre-prints and not peer reviewed. So this was a

24:44.720 --> 24:50.320
 randomized double blind placebo control clinical trial conducted in China in Canada, the United

24:50.320 --> 24:55.120
 States, Europe, South America, and South Africa. And it was designed to determine whether

24:55.120 --> 24:59.680
 culture scene would reduce the risk of severe complications associated with COVID-19.

25:00.560 --> 25:04.480
 And there's some interesting, I'll say background theory on all kinds of ideas about how culture

25:04.480 --> 25:10.240
 scene might work, might interfere with the microtubules, might affect the virus, might do immune

25:10.240 --> 25:18.160
 modulation. But they ended up they enrolled 4,488 COVID-19 patients, non hospitalized at the time

25:18.160 --> 25:25.200
 of enrollment. They ended up analyzing 4,159 patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19.

25:26.640 --> 25:33.520
 And those patients with a proven diagnosis of COVID-19 on culture scene versus placebo

25:33.520 --> 25:43.360
 hospitalizations, 4.5 versus 5.9. The need for mechanical ventilation, 0.5 versus 0.9 deaths,

25:43.360 --> 25:50.560
 0.2 versus 0.4. Nothing reaching statistical significance until you start lumping stuff together.

25:51.440 --> 25:57.200
 But then I will add that 13.7% of the culture scene patients developed diarrhea and that added

25:57.200 --> 26:04.400
 p value of less than 0.001. So we did reach statistical significance in giving people diarrhea. But

26:05.440 --> 26:13.280
 little disappointing looking at over 4,000 patients and seeing this, you know, 0.2 versus 0.4 as far as

26:13.280 --> 26:17.200
 death. So I was a little bit disappointed. I was pretty excited that we were going to see

26:17.200 --> 26:23.040
 something here based on the press release. Now there's a lot of data coming out and I'm sort of

26:23.040 --> 26:31.040
 getting the preliminary stuff on the ATT ACC, the ACTI 4A and the REM CAP studies looking at

26:31.040 --> 26:36.800
 anti-coagulation. I've had a chance to look at the interim data so far. But I'm going to put

26:36.800 --> 26:40.880
 that on the back burner. That's something we're going to talk about next week. To finish off

26:40.880 --> 26:45.840
 with the tail phase, I always want to talk about the tail phase. More information about how long

26:45.840 --> 26:51.760
 COVID patients have autoantibodies, suggestions that this may be tied into some of the symptoms.

26:52.400 --> 26:57.440
 This is evolving, so we'll get back to that when I know more. But all right, our fundraiser,

26:57.440 --> 27:01.920
 we're still, this is our final episode, encouraging people to help us support

27:02.800 --> 27:08.480
 the P-Scores HIV and AIDS programs. Thank you so much for all the support we've gotten.

27:08.480 --> 27:14.800
 Look forward to supporting the men. We have a very exciting upcoming fundraiser that will start

27:14.800 --> 27:19.760
 February and March. But I'm going to leave everyone in suspense and we'll announce that next time.

27:20.960 --> 27:25.920
 Daniel, after the last two of you talked about where we talked about immunization of healthcare

27:25.920 --> 27:30.400
 workers, I got an angry email saying, how dare you think we don't know how to prevent getting

27:30.400 --> 27:36.000
 infection? But weren't the healthcare workers on the priority vaccination group and wouldn't you

27:36.000 --> 27:40.560
 want them to stay healthy so that they can keep working? You know, I think that's really interesting,

27:40.560 --> 27:45.360
 right? They know how to stay. Is it getting vaccinated the way and washing your hands?

27:47.520 --> 27:51.920
 You know, I have to say, it's really, it's really a shame. There's a large healthcare system

27:51.920 --> 27:56.240
 bias, you know, and it's made of a lot of different hospitals and each hospital has sort of a different

27:56.240 --> 28:01.760
 culture also to, I'll say, you know, and that healthcare system, what majority of the people

28:01.760 --> 28:07.440
 working there don't want to get vaccinated, which shocks me. I remember the time their flagship

28:07.440 --> 28:14.000
 hospital got scolded because nobody washes their hands. I mean, it's just like, come on. So yeah,

28:14.000 --> 28:18.720
 all right, send send us the angry emails. Remember, that's at peterhotes.com.

28:21.120 --> 28:27.520
 We have an email from Bhavna in Delhi, India, whose parents got COVID in November. And he's

28:27.520 --> 28:32.640
 concerned. His parents are doctors. They're going to get vaccinated AstraZeneca, but he's

28:32.640 --> 28:38.320
 concerned about his dad taking it so soon. I can't find any substantial data on how people who had

28:38.320 --> 28:44.640
 moderate to severe disease a few months ago react to the vaccine. So some advice for Bhavna.

28:45.760 --> 28:50.640
 Yeah, we talked about this a little bit last time and this goes into my never miss an opportunity

28:50.640 --> 28:55.200
 to immunize. So if your dad is the opportunity to get a vaccine, go ahead and get that vaccine

28:55.200 --> 29:00.720
 for your dad. The CDC recommends no minimal interval between the time you've been vaccinated,

29:00.720 --> 29:05.840
 and the time you've been infected, and when you get a vaccine. Now, I know some of my colleagues

29:05.840 --> 29:10.640
 say, Oh, you know, wait a few months. Do not miss the opportunity to vaccinate. We've now

29:10.640 --> 29:16.560
 vaccinated millions of people. Lots of them had COVID before I personally vaccinated,

29:16.560 --> 29:21.440
 you know, lots of people that had their fine. We are not seeing any signal to suggest that

29:21.440 --> 29:26.960
 people who have been infected before are going to end up having problems with the vaccine or do

29:26.960 --> 29:35.200
 have anymore. Last night, I vaccinated a gentleman who was on the ventilator for 55 days. He's now

29:35.200 --> 29:41.280
 better. When I vaccinated him, he cried tears of joy. He and his wife were just so relieved. This

29:41.280 --> 29:47.360
 was his second dose. And I said two weeks, keep yourselves two weeks, you're almost there.

29:47.360 --> 29:51.680
 Keep going. So yeah, particularly, Oh my gosh, people who've been sick before.

29:52.480 --> 29:55.760
 Let's get them vaccinated because you do not want to have a second infection.

29:56.400 --> 30:00.160
 And we're seeing the data. Yeah, you're you're unlikely to get infected in the first three months.

30:00.960 --> 30:05.520
 Your chance increases by six months. And as we go farther out, we're seeing people get

30:05.520 --> 30:10.880
 reinfected. Let's make sure we vaccinate these people. The CDC says there's no reason to wait.

30:10.880 --> 30:14.240
 I say there's no reason to wait. The science says there's no reason to wait.

30:14.240 --> 30:22.240
 David in the UK asks with a further trial showing advantage and survival for toselism map. Do you

30:22.240 --> 30:26.240
 think your clinical practice will change reading between the lines? It seems to be in combination

30:26.240 --> 30:32.960
 with steroids as you have long suggested. Yeah, I have to say, dude, my practice hasn't

30:32.960 --> 30:36.960
 necessarily changed. Interesting enough. I mean, we've we've talked about this early on sort of

30:36.960 --> 30:41.280
 our experience that you don't want to give it without steroids. You want to give it in a

30:41.280 --> 30:46.400
 background so that people have been on steroids. And if that person escalates to high flow nasal

30:46.400 --> 30:50.960
 cannula, they're heading towards the ICU, you think they're going to require intubation.

30:50.960 --> 30:55.920
 I think our experience and now the science is pretty clear that the right patient the right

30:55.920 --> 31:04.320
 time toselism map reduces people that require mechanical ventilation. It reduces your chance

31:04.320 --> 31:07.920
 of death actually with mortality benefits if used in the right patient with the right

31:07.920 --> 31:12.800
 background of steroids at the right time. But I have to say, it's really difficult. And we talked

31:12.800 --> 31:19.200
 about this on the ash guidelines meeting this week. A lot of people are suddenly sort of put

31:19.200 --> 31:23.760
 into positions of power and decision making that they were not used to that they did not

31:23.760 --> 31:28.480
 have before and maybe didn't have the experience for people that never sat on a guideline panel.

31:28.480 --> 31:33.680
 So they see guidelines and they say, no, no, these are the rules. We are really careful and we're

31:33.680 --> 31:38.800
 talking about when we publish our guidelines coming up that we're going to actually put in

31:38.800 --> 31:43.440
 a line where we say the qualification, we feel like people don't quite understand guidelines saying,

31:43.440 --> 31:50.160
 these are guidelines, but you should be caring for your patients based upon the most recent,

31:50.160 --> 31:56.000
 the most available, the most up-to-date data. So I had a painful conversation about a weekend

31:56.000 --> 31:59.760
 back. I ended up with a medical director at a hospital where I don't spend a lot of time and

31:59.760 --> 32:05.680
 either an endocrinologist, renal doc, I forget his specialty. And he was aware of some of the

32:05.680 --> 32:09.680
 latest head. He said, oh, we're aware of their stuff out there. We're going to probably meet next

32:09.680 --> 32:14.560
 month and discuss it. I really haven't taken the time to go through it, but I'm not going to

32:14.560 --> 32:21.120
 authorize Tostalizumev on this patient who actually laid it that day ended up ventilated in the ICU.

32:21.120 --> 32:26.160
 And so it's a little bit difficult. I have to say, from my perspective, as a specialist,

32:26.160 --> 32:31.360
 to see that a lot of institutions want one-size-fits-all and decisions are being made about patient

32:31.360 --> 32:37.600
 care, I think not really appreciating what is the latest data. If my family members in the hospital

32:37.600 --> 32:41.520
 and there's an expert in the field who's keeping up on the literature and making decisions,

32:41.520 --> 32:45.440
 that's quite a bit different than something being managed by an administrator.

32:45.440 --> 32:49.760
 Carson writes, is there any known correlation between a person's reaction to a vaccine and

32:49.760 --> 32:54.640
 the strength of that person's immune response to a person who gets vaccinated and has no side

32:54.640 --> 32:58.960
 effects be concerned that perhaps they didn't have a significant immune response?

32:59.520 --> 33:03.760
 I like that, right? Because we always, when the person has a warm arm and the seven-day

33:03.760 --> 33:09.200
 entry, say, oh, you're having a really strong, robust immune response, people respond really

33:09.200 --> 33:13.600
 well to these vaccines, whether or not they have any kind of local reactogenicity or not.

33:13.600 --> 33:19.840
 So no reason to check anything. These are vaccines with really high efficacy against

33:19.840 --> 33:25.520
 severe disease. Yeah, with that, whether or not you have a strong reaction, you should not be

33:25.520 --> 33:32.080
 concerned. All right, one more from Julia, who says, can you give us an update on Kawasaki-like

33:32.080 --> 33:36.880
 symptoms in children? I haven't heard much about it. Are we seeing it? Do we have any more information?

33:36.880 --> 33:42.400
 How are the affected kids six months out from infection? Yeah, so some of the nice things

33:42.400 --> 33:47.440
 that have developed over time here is that CDC has really provided good guidance, good links,

33:47.440 --> 33:55.040
 and actually, if people are concerned, we had a recent case where it was an adult with multi-inflammatory

33:55.040 --> 34:01.360
 syndrome, multi-inflammatory system, adult, so Miss A versus Miss C. And you can get on the phone,

34:01.360 --> 34:06.720
 you can reach out to the CDC. There aren't enough cases to say anything in general,

34:06.720 --> 34:12.320
 but some of these children have had cardiac issues, so they're being followed by cardiologists on a

34:12.320 --> 34:17.520
 regular basis. We're learning a lot. We still only have, as mentioned, about six months of data,

34:17.520 --> 34:23.600
 so we'll learn more. This is something we're still seeing, and unfortunately, there's a lot of cases

34:23.600 --> 34:29.120
 of COVID in children, and this is one of those, though not common. You start having a really

34:29.120 --> 34:34.720
 large population affected, and you start seeing more of these cases. All right, that is COVID-19

34:34.720 --> 34:40.960
 clinical update number 47 with Dr. Daniel Griffin. Thank you, Daniel. Oh, thank you so much,

34:40.960 --> 34:45.600
 and everybody, be safe.
