 This week in virology, the podcast about viruses, the kind that make you sick.

00:10.480 --> 00:20.480
 From MicrobeTV, this is Twiv, this week in virology. Episode 783, recorded on June 22, 2021.

00:21.120 --> 00:27.040
 I'm Vincent Rackeniello, and you're listening to the podcast all about viruses. Joining me

00:27.040 --> 00:30.960
 today from New York, Daniel Griffin. Hello, everyone.

00:32.080 --> 00:39.280
 Daniel, I noticed that the U.S. vaccination is just approaching 50% for fully vaccinated.

00:39.280 --> 00:45.120
 That doesn't seem like a lot, does it? No, no. That was my Anthony Fauci, you know, where I

00:47.120 --> 00:54.800
 put my hand up and shake my head. So listening to another podcast the other day,

00:54.800 --> 01:02.000
 it's one that Andy Slavitt does. And he was interviewing somebody from Facebook,

01:02.560 --> 01:06.640
 and they were talking about the fact that 65% of the

01:07.440 --> 01:14.000
 miss and disinformation regarding vaccines comes from 12 individuals, 12 individuals.

01:14.000 --> 01:17.760
 And they just pump the stuff out, you know, and they get banned from Twitter, but then they're

01:17.760 --> 01:27.120
 still on Facebook. And yeah, I mean, you know, this active disinformation is killing people.

01:27.760 --> 01:32.880
 And, you know, I was on a call with a United Health Group, sort of the Optum, one of the

01:32.880 --> 01:37.360
 higher groups. And there was a lot of pessimism about, you know, the people that aren't going to

01:37.360 --> 01:41.520
 get vaccinated, just not going to get vaccinated. I don't think that's true. I mean, these individuals

01:41.520 --> 01:48.240
 are still spending an incredible amount of time, millions of dollars to introduce fear,

01:48.240 --> 01:53.920
 to just make stuff up about the vaccines. And one of the comments, I think it was a Kaiser

01:53.920 --> 01:58.640
 survey where they asked people. And four out of five people who are not vaccinated

01:58.640 --> 02:02.320
 believe something about the vaccine. That's not true. They were told something, they were

02:02.320 --> 02:08.880
 misinformed. So yeah, we really have to make a difference here. And a lot of it, you know,

02:08.880 --> 02:12.000
 how do you get someone who's not vaccinated to get vaccinated? Number one is you listen,

02:12.640 --> 02:16.400
 you stop, you take a deep breath, you listen, what are your concerns? You don't ridicule them.

02:17.040 --> 02:22.320
 And a lot of times they've been told something by someone, and it's just not true. And I think

02:22.320 --> 02:26.880
 we need to have patients, we need to have humility, we need to reach out to these individuals.

02:27.680 --> 02:34.000
 Because I think that if they actually knew the facts, a large number of people would come to the

02:34.000 --> 02:39.760
 conclusion that it's not so important to be part of a tribe that you're going to put the lives of

02:39.760 --> 02:47.360
 yourself and your loved ones at risk by choosing to get COVID, as opposed to choosing a much safer

02:47.360 --> 02:55.360
 option, which is the vaccines. What is the motivation of these 12 individuals who spread

02:55.360 --> 03:02.880
 misinformation? You know, I'm speculating, of course, we do know that there's a big sort of

03:02.880 --> 03:09.600
 financial incentive. There's a lot of power that comes along with, you know, stirring up the masses.

03:10.240 --> 03:13.760
 I think it was disturbing to find out, right, what happened in France where scientists were

03:13.760 --> 03:21.840
 actually taking money to sign letters. It's really, you know, at some point you can't have a price,

03:21.840 --> 03:27.760
 your price has to be truth and honesty. And I think these individuals need to look in the mirror and

03:27.760 --> 03:34.160
 ask, like, is that is that blood money worth it? Are you willing to take this money? Because this is

03:34.160 --> 03:43.440
 not honest scientific discussion. This is pure blatant misinformation. It's just wrong.

03:44.480 --> 03:46.240
 Okay. All right.

03:50.480 --> 03:54.800
 I don't know if that's I don't think that's political. I feel like that's just honesty.

03:54.800 --> 03:59.680
 But anyway, so let's let's start off with two quotes from a rather impressive woman.

04:00.640 --> 04:04.080
 And I'm going to give the quotes, then we'll be like our four second pause while people

04:04.080 --> 04:10.800
 see if they can remember who who said these things. The work of today is the history of tomorrow

04:10.800 --> 04:18.000
 and we are its makers. And the second quotation to be inspired is great, but to be an inspiration

04:18.000 --> 04:24.720
 is an honor. Juliet Gordon Lowe. I am impressed. You don't even have daughters.

04:27.440 --> 04:32.000
 So yes, that was Juliet Gordon Lowe, the founder of the Girl Scouts of America.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
 I do have a daughter. I do have a daughter.

04:34.000 --> 04:39.040
 You do have a daughter? Yes. And she would, that's why I know.

04:39.040 --> 04:43.200
 Did you see there was a pause there, everyone? It took me so in a moment to remember.

04:43.200 --> 04:50.800
 Yeah, I just listened to you. I was like, wait a second. All right. So yes. Yeah.

04:50.800 --> 04:56.080
 So Juliet Gordon Lowe was the founder of Girl Scouts of America, really a tremendous organization.

04:56.080 --> 05:02.160
 So yeah, and really just a really inspiring woman. And you know, I don't know if people were aware,

05:02.160 --> 05:07.840
 but the Girl Scouts of America actually did a get the vote out. And now I know there's discussions

05:07.840 --> 05:14.560
 about get the vaccine out. Having Girl Scouts try to help with these efforts. I have two daughters.

05:15.600 --> 05:23.200
 I know that right away without a pause. And they both actually went all the way through,

05:23.200 --> 05:30.720
 became sort of these gold star at the end. They did their gold awards. And actually the last,

05:30.720 --> 05:36.480
 actually Eloise's Gold Award was the service dog project and raising a service dog, doing the

05:36.480 --> 05:42.800
 puppy rearing and then doing information sessions about it. So tremendous organization, tremendous

05:42.800 --> 05:47.680
 woman. And I think right now when we look at these individuals that are not vaccinated,

05:47.680 --> 05:54.720
 who is the most influential person? It's your friend. It's your family. So reach out to your

05:54.720 --> 05:59.520
 friends and family. Reach out to people you care about. Have honest, respectful discussions about

05:59.520 --> 06:06.080
 the vaccines. We can make a difference. We can get over this hump. Hundreds of people do not need

06:06.080 --> 06:10.720
 to keep dying every day in the US. Thousands of people do not need to keep dying around the world

06:10.720 --> 06:17.920
 every day. We have safe, incredibly effective vaccines. All right, so let me update on what's

06:17.920 --> 06:26.720
 going on. As people know, the trends are not great. We went from a cruise ship of people dying

06:26.720 --> 06:31.360
 per day in America down to a jumbo jet crashing every day as far as numbers of people dying.

06:31.360 --> 06:38.800
 That's not great. And the numbers are going up. But I will say at least in our local area,

06:38.800 --> 06:45.360
 when we are seeing vaccinated people get infected, it's mild. It's very rare for them to end up in

06:45.360 --> 06:50.800
 the hospital. It's incredibly rare for them to die, right? We're going from a one in 30 chance of

06:50.800 --> 06:56.640
 death in an unvaccinated to a one in a million. And we're going to talk a little bit about kids

06:56.640 --> 07:01.520
 here in a moment. There's a lot of fear still in the media about this. The fear should be

07:02.240 --> 07:07.200
 driving people to vaccination. But once you're vaccinated, that is a very good place to be.

07:08.160 --> 07:13.040
 One of my friends and colleagues actually wrote a paper, maybe a couple papers in the last year,

07:13.040 --> 07:19.280
 Denise Brennan Ryder, she's an Irish Canadian. She's also a mother. And she was sharing with me

07:19.280 --> 07:25.040
 recently just some of the struggles that she's been going through as a mom with issues with

07:25.040 --> 07:32.320
 access to vaccination and concerns that her children have. And I just, we need to sort of

07:32.320 --> 07:37.120
 balance. And as I talk about kids, I always say kids are at low risk, but they're not at no risk.

07:37.120 --> 07:42.800
 But there is a balance here with all the fear. The vaccines continue to work. Even when we hear

07:42.800 --> 07:49.120
 about these new variants, they continue to be very effective at preventing serious disease,

07:49.120 --> 07:55.200
 preventing hospitalization. We would love if they were 100% for our herd immunity aspect.

07:55.760 --> 08:00.640
 But that's only a small part of the story. And that should be sort of balanced with all the

08:00.640 --> 08:06.080
 fear that we see in the media. So just want to sort of start with that. But let's get right

08:06.080 --> 08:11.680
 on to kids. And I'm going to talk about long COVID in kids, because I think this is part of

08:11.680 --> 08:19.040
 the metric, part of the equation that people are not considering. And I actually had a gentleman

08:19.040 --> 08:25.280
 email me directly earlier today. And I really sort of taken him back because his daughter's

08:25.280 --> 08:31.120
 pediatrician, she's an eligible adolescent, the US pediatrician was not really in favor of

08:31.120 --> 08:37.360
 vaccination and had not recommended vaccination. So I was a bit shocked. And I know sometimes

08:37.360 --> 08:43.120
 people say, well, you know, only a few hundred children have died while we shut down everything.

08:43.120 --> 08:49.360
 Only several thousand children ended up in the hospital. But what about kids that got COVID?

08:49.360 --> 08:54.880
 How are they doing two, three months down the road? Is long COVID a significant issue in children?

08:54.880 --> 09:02.160
 So we just saw the study, long-term symptoms after SARS-CoV-2 infection in children and adolescents

09:02.160 --> 09:07.120
 published in JAMA, the Journal of the American Medical Association. And the authors addressed a

09:07.120 --> 09:13.040
 significant issue that we really need to know about when we're looking at return to school this

09:13.040 --> 09:16.960
 fall, right? We have a lot of people saying, eh, get the kids back in school. Not a big issue

09:16.960 --> 09:23.040
 if kids get COVID. I don't want my kid wearing a mask or anyone else. Well, we know about deaths.

09:23.040 --> 09:31.120
 We know about hospitalizations. What about long COVID? So this was a longitudinal cohort study

09:31.120 --> 09:40.080
 investigating SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in 55 randomly selected schools in areas in Switzerland.

09:40.640 --> 09:47.040
 And they chose a linguistically and ethnically diverse population of 1.5 million residents in

09:47.040 --> 09:53.040
 both urban and rural settings. So we're getting a nice cross-section here. The investigators

09:53.040 --> 09:59.200
 collected blood for serological analysis and then used questionnaires to assess the symptoms.

09:59.200 --> 10:06.880
 They compared children who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 with those who tested negative during a

10:06.880 --> 10:15.200
 period October, November 2020. Ultimately, over 1,355 children were included in the analysis.

10:15.760 --> 10:22.560
 And what did they find? They found that the most frequently reported symptoms lasting more than

10:22.560 --> 10:30.560
 12 weeks. I just want to repeat that. 12 weeks, right? So three months after these children had

10:30.560 --> 10:38.800
 been infected with COVID, 3% of them were still reporting that significant fatigue. 2% were still

10:38.800 --> 10:45.360
 reporting difficulty concentrating. Another 2% were reporting an increased need for sleep.

10:46.560 --> 10:50.560
 Now, there are background rates. You know, we assess these symptoms. So just think about asking

10:50.560 --> 10:57.200
 1,000 kids, you know, and there is sort of a background rate. But overall, what they were seeing

10:57.200 --> 11:04.640
 is about 4% of the serology positive children were still having symptoms 3 months later. So that's

11:04.640 --> 11:13.680
 1 in 25 kids who gets COVID is still having issues 3 months later, right? Symptoms consistent with

11:13.680 --> 11:18.720
 long COVID. So I just I want people to think about this when you send kids back to school.

11:18.720 --> 11:25.200
 So let's say you're your child. Let's say you have a daughter like Vincent now remembers and she goes

11:25.200 --> 11:31.120
 to class. And you know, there's 25 kids in the class. And we say, oh, you know what, not a big deal.

11:31.120 --> 11:37.040
 We'll just let them all get COVID. It's not a big deal. One of those 25 kids is still going to be

11:37.040 --> 11:44.800
 sick 3 months later. I have to say as a parent that that's too high for me 1 in 25. So we look at

11:44.800 --> 11:50.800
 the risks of vaccination. You know, we're talking about short lived myocardial cardiac inflammation

11:50.800 --> 11:56.160
 maybe for a couple days that gets better with over the counter medicine rates of maybe 1 in 100,000

11:56.160 --> 12:03.360
 1 in a million things like that versus 1 in 25 being sick for 3 months having problems going to

12:03.360 --> 12:08.400
 school. So I think when people talk about the risks in children, you can't just look at deaths.

12:08.400 --> 12:13.520
 You can't just look at hospitalizations. It's the same as adults. You've got to look at the whole

12:13.520 --> 12:20.320
 picture. And when someone has long COVID, that's that's a disaster. That's a tragedy in my book.

12:22.160 --> 12:28.960
 Now we did get some some good news in the realm of pediatrics. And this was what about those kids

12:28.960 --> 12:37.200
 who had that multi-system inflammatory syndrome. So there was a publication in pediatrics. That's

12:37.200 --> 12:42.960
 the official journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics. Longitudinal outcomes for multi-system

12:42.960 --> 12:49.920
 inflammatory syndrome in children. And the authors reported on all of the 45 children that had been

12:49.920 --> 12:54.240
 admitted to Columbia Presbyterian Hospital. It's like about a block or two from where

12:54.240 --> 13:02.080
 Vincent is sitting right now. And they followed them actually out to four to nine months. And they

13:02.080 --> 13:07.440
 found that basically about a month, a lot of the inflammatory markers were going down. When they

13:07.440 --> 13:14.320
 got far out, only one child was still having persistent mild dysfunction. One had mild mitral

13:14.320 --> 13:19.920
 and tricuspid regurgitation. But in general, the kids were getting better. So I think that is

13:20.480 --> 13:26.160
 that's reassuring. We don't have longer term outcome. But the authors actually concluded

13:26.160 --> 13:32.560
 the majority of children with Miss C. So that's multi-system inflammatory syndrome of children

13:32.560 --> 13:39.600
 present critically ill. But most inflammatory and cardiac manifestations go on to resolve

13:39.600 --> 13:47.120
 in a period of months. So rapidly. So that's nice to know. I know people have always asked

13:47.120 --> 13:54.720
 what happened to these kids. Now, sticking with children here, the American Academy of Pediatrics

13:54.720 --> 14:02.320
 came out with some recent guidance with a statement that got a bit oppressed. Some people

14:02.320 --> 14:07.680
 are unhappy about it. So let me go through the high points of that statement because some people

14:07.680 --> 14:13.600
 are asking how do we take this statement and mesh it with what we're hearing from the CDC

14:13.600 --> 14:19.440
 as we're looking at school opening. So the first part is in line. American Academy of Pediatrics

14:19.440 --> 14:26.640
 is saying all eligible individuals should receive the COVID-19 vaccine. So that pediatrician, I'm

14:26.640 --> 14:31.440
 not sure what professional organization he gets his guidance from. But the American Academy of

14:31.440 --> 14:37.840
 Pediatrics is recommending that we go ahead and vaccinate all the eligible information.

14:39.040 --> 14:45.280
 The other is, and this is the thing that was controversial, all students older than two years

14:45.280 --> 14:51.360
 and all school staff should wear face masks at school unless medical or developmental conditions

14:51.360 --> 14:57.680
 prohibit use. Why? So they do. I think they knew that this would get some feedback. So they go

14:57.680 --> 15:04.960
 ahead and they give us five reasons. So the AAP recommends universal masking in school at this

15:04.960 --> 15:10.240
 time for the following five reasons. One, a significant portion of the student population

15:10.240 --> 15:17.200
 is not eligible for vaccination. So I think that's something. Second, protection of unvaccinated

15:17.200 --> 15:24.000
 students from COVID-19 and to reduce transmission. This is sort of coupled with the fact that we do

15:24.000 --> 15:29.040
 not have a system to monitor the vaccine status among the students, the teachers and staff.

15:30.000 --> 15:35.360
 And I think we've all had that experience. You know, you go into a supermarket in an area where maybe

15:35.360 --> 15:39.440
 50% of the people are vaccinated, but no one's wearing a mask because people who are vaccinated

15:39.440 --> 15:44.560
 don't need to wear a mask. Well, people who are unvaccinated have got the masks off too. So

15:44.560 --> 15:49.040
 they're pointing that out. There's really no good system for knowing who's vaccinated

15:49.040 --> 15:57.520
 and enforcing masks only for the vaccinated unvaccinated. Point three, potential and this ties right in

15:57.520 --> 16:02.800
 potential difficulty in monitoring or enforcing mask policies for those who are not vaccinated.

16:04.560 --> 16:09.280
 The ability of schools, and this is right in the same, to have consistent messaging,

16:09.280 --> 16:14.720
 expectations, enforcement and compliance without needing to try to monitor vaccination status.

16:14.720 --> 16:21.600
 Four, and this is sort of relates to the community, right? The biggest risk for a child is what's

16:21.600 --> 16:26.320
 going on in the community around the school. Schools are often safer than the environment

16:26.320 --> 16:33.200
 around. And so the AAP says the possibility of low vaccination uptake within the surrounding

16:33.200 --> 16:39.360
 school community. And then finally five, and this we'll be touching on as we go further,

16:39.360 --> 16:44.800
 continued concerns for variants that are more easily spread among children, adolescents and

16:44.800 --> 16:50.720
 adults. So they've got their recommendation for face masks at school, and they've got their

16:50.720 --> 16:59.760
 explanation for why they're saying that. All right, now pre-exposer testing, right? So testing

16:59.760 --> 17:04.240
 never miss an opportunity to test. Now I know when I talked about some of the other guidance,

17:04.240 --> 17:11.120
 part of the school reopening guidance is having testing strategies. But I'm excited that we have

17:11.120 --> 17:18.000
 some data now to understand what's going on potentially with transmission with the Delta

17:18.000 --> 17:23.600
 variant. What is going on? Is it spreading faster? What are the kinetics here? What's happening? So

17:23.600 --> 17:30.000
 we got an interesting publication, viral infection and transmission in a large, well-traced outbreak

17:30.000 --> 17:35.920
 caused by the Delta SARS-CoV-2 variant. And this was published by a group that was looking at

17:36.800 --> 17:43.360
 cases in China. Now I've talked a bit about how sloppy the word transmissible is,

17:44.080 --> 17:50.240
 and that when we hear that a certain virus, a certain variant is becoming dominant,

17:50.240 --> 17:55.280
 we really need to understand the mechanism behind this variant's fitness advantage.

17:55.280 --> 18:00.560
 And I think that this paper was a step in the right direction. So did we get any answers? Well,

18:00.560 --> 18:07.280
 the authors investigated data from quarantine subjects in this Delta variant outbreak,

18:07.280 --> 18:14.560
 and compared it to previous 2020 epidemic outbreaks caused by earlier variants.

18:14.560 --> 18:20.480
 So a couple of questions that they tried to address. One is there a shorter reproductive

18:20.480 --> 18:25.840
 time. So let me explain a little bit about what I mean by that. So you get exposed to someone who

18:26.400 --> 18:33.280
 has SARS-CoV-2 infection, who has COVID-19, who is contagious, you have your exposure event.

18:34.480 --> 18:41.760
 Now what is the time from exposure till you test positive or till you test positive and have

18:41.760 --> 18:47.200
 enough virus that you can transmit it to the next individual? So this is the time for infection to

18:47.200 --> 18:52.160
 becoming PCR positive and being able to give the virus to the next person, sort of a nuance of that.

18:53.120 --> 18:59.760
 Now their results showed that the time interval from exposure to first PCR positivity in the

18:59.760 --> 19:09.840
 quarantine population was four days versus six days. So six days was what we saw back in the 2020,

19:09.840 --> 19:14.320
 and now we're seeing four days. So that's an interesting issue, and I'm going to talk a little

19:14.320 --> 19:20.880
 bit about whether our experience meshes with this. The other thing that they saw, and I think this

19:20.880 --> 19:28.400
 needs to be taken in context, that first positive test that they were seeing was a thousand times

19:28.400 --> 19:35.840
 higher as far as the RNA copy number. So what we think we're seeing here is from zero. At day

19:35.840 --> 19:42.240
 four people are already PCR positive, but they're already at a level of virus that makes them

19:42.240 --> 19:48.320
 contagious. Now when we talked about day six turning PCR positive, usually at day six they

19:48.320 --> 19:54.320
 were PCR positive, but at a high CT value, so a high cycle threshold, low level of virus,

19:54.880 --> 19:59.680
 not quite transmitting, so you could pull them out before they spread it to the next person.

19:59.680 --> 20:05.040
 Usually it was day seven that they were contagious. So instead of seven days from exposure to

20:05.040 --> 20:11.680
 spreading to the next person, this may be shortened to only four days. So we're thinking that there

20:11.680 --> 20:19.360
 is a more rapid rise from negative to infectious. People have looked at that thousand times higher,

20:19.360 --> 20:25.040
 and I want to point out that's just looking at the first positive test. That's not the peak.

20:25.040 --> 20:30.480
 We don't have the area under the curve. We did not follow these people every single day to see

20:30.480 --> 20:35.520
 whether there's been a change in the duration at high levels, so the area under the curve,

20:35.520 --> 20:40.880
 the period that they might become infectious. And I've sort of been asking, does this really

20:40.880 --> 20:45.280
 mesh with our experience? And one of the things our listeners may know is we do these large

20:45.280 --> 20:51.040
 screening programs for the movie industry, where we test thousands of people every night

20:51.040 --> 20:55.040
 with the idea that we're going to catch them early when they first get positive,

20:55.040 --> 20:59.440
 and that we've got this day before they become infectious. So someone tests positive on a Wednesday

20:59.440 --> 21:05.200
 night. Usually it's a high CT value. We say, that's great. We grab you, we pull you out. We've been

21:05.200 --> 21:11.280
 doing this for over a year without having any issues. What we're now seeing, unfortunately,

21:11.280 --> 21:17.360
 is we're seeing a lot of people testing positive. The concern is when they test positive that night,

21:17.360 --> 21:22.400
 they may have already been infectious in the latter half of the day. When we're talking to

21:22.400 --> 21:28.240
 our outpatient providers, when someone says, Boy, I felt crummy for about a day. So I decided to

21:28.240 --> 21:35.440
 finally get tested. Now you get them a PCR test. There's a 36 hour resulting delay. You call them

21:35.440 --> 21:40.480
 and you say, John, your test is positive. We got to figure out who you may have exposed.

21:40.480 --> 21:45.120
 When you test those people that they've exposed, those people are already positive,

21:45.120 --> 21:50.720
 and they're already positive at high level. So this data is meshing with our experience.

21:50.720 --> 21:56.960
 And as you can imagine, this really challenges our Tetris, our contact tracing paradigm.

21:56.960 --> 22:03.280
 If by the time you tell someone that they're PCR positive, everyone they've exposed is also

22:03.280 --> 22:08.640
 already PCR positive at a contagious level. It's already sort of spread to the next year,

22:08.640 --> 22:15.680
 and it's kind of a dominoes type phenomenon. So this is one paper. This is meshing with our

22:15.680 --> 22:21.360
 experience, but we need more data to help us with this because this is a problem. If it is a shorter

22:21.360 --> 22:26.480
 incubation time, shorter from time to exposure to spreading, that could explain a lot of what we're

22:26.480 --> 22:30.480
 seeing. It also is really relevant to how we're going to address this.

22:32.480 --> 22:38.320
 If I may jump in, I was hoping that my dramatic pause would get you pulled in Vincent.

22:38.320 --> 22:44.960
 Just two things first. So the shorter serial interval, that's what this is.

22:45.920 --> 22:52.160
 That could account for a more rapid spread, but it doesn't mean the virus is more transmissible

22:52.160 --> 22:59.200
 intrinsically. It just reproduces faster, and therefore can go from one host to another.

22:59.760 --> 23:04.800
 Quicker in, as you said, people are infectious sooner, and that can result in more people being

23:04.800 --> 23:08.800
 infected as a consequence. That's possible. But I would say it's not intrinsic,

23:09.520 --> 23:14.960
 greater transmissibility of the virus. And then I agree we need more data on that.

23:14.960 --> 23:22.400
 The other issue is that PCR, a thousand times, that might not be infectious virus. So I think

23:22.400 --> 23:26.960
 at some point, people need to do infectious virus measurements. We have to stop depending

23:26.960 --> 23:33.040
 on PCR, because I can imagine a variant throws off more MRNAs, and that's going to show up

23:33.040 --> 23:38.480
 positive in the PCR, but it's not infectious virus. So nobody has done that for any of the

23:38.480 --> 23:44.800
 variants yet, and I'm a little bit frustrated at that. Yeah, no, and I share your frustration,

23:44.800 --> 23:49.520
 and I think that this is really, from my point, you can't just use the word transmissibly. You

23:49.520 --> 23:54.800
 always say, what are you talking about? Because if it's a shorter incubation period, so many of

23:54.800 --> 24:01.840
 our rules about when you contact trace, how long a person you say, we need to know the

24:01.840 --> 24:08.160
 kinetics of infectious, viable virus for all the variants. We need to keep doing the research.

24:08.160 --> 24:12.480
 We can't say, oh, we've got this for the, you know, because this is this is a problem.

24:13.120 --> 24:17.680
 And I think also people have probably seen the Olympics when people are, quote, unquote, testing

24:17.680 --> 24:23.360
 positive. What does that mean? Are they having a low level of RNA positivity? They actually have

24:23.360 --> 24:27.760
 viable infectious virus. Do we need to pull Olympic athletes who've been vaccinated or

24:27.760 --> 24:31.760
 young and healthy out for 10 days? Because that's what we did, you know, a year ago.

24:32.560 --> 24:36.800
 Yeah, we need we can't be sloppy with our language because it matters. It affects

24:36.800 --> 24:44.720
 it affects what we do. It affects people. All right, active vaccination. Never miss an

24:44.720 --> 24:50.000
 opportunity to vaccinate vaccination is how this pandemic ends and no one is safe until we're all

24:50.000 --> 24:55.600
 safe. And I know I get a lot of questions actually seem like I got a lot more this week and I'm not

24:55.600 --> 25:02.800
 sure if it's that we're hitting a particular population, but they want to know, you know, if I had a

25:02.800 --> 25:12.240
 COVID-19 before, if I had a natural infection, do I really need to get vaccinated? Maybe I'm just

25:12.240 --> 25:17.360
 okay. And so I'm just going to take a little aside to, you know, I think all the clinicians

25:17.360 --> 25:22.560
 that are getting these questions, I'm going to answer it for all of you. We do have information

25:22.560 --> 25:30.080
 on this topic in three forms. So this is I had COVID-19. Do I need to get vaccinated? So one,

25:30.080 --> 25:36.480
 we have a number of the serology and T cell studies, right? There was that nice paper in

25:36.480 --> 25:44.640
 cell that we discussed back in June, reduced neutralization of SARS-CoV-2-B1617 by vaccine

25:44.640 --> 25:50.400
 and convalescent serum, right? Because people really are now asking about the delta variant.

25:51.360 --> 25:56.880
 You know, and we've talked a little bit about neutralizing antibody convalescent plasma. We

25:56.880 --> 26:03.760
 also had reduced sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 variant delta to antibody neutralization published in

26:03.760 --> 26:09.920
 nature. And that was just this month. Both papers suggesting convalescent plasma was about four

26:09.920 --> 26:17.200
 times less potent against the delta variant. But if we've discussed many times, we don't really know,

26:17.200 --> 26:22.640
 you know, what that translates into. We really sort of think that T cells are important.

26:22.640 --> 26:29.680
 So we have some information on T cells in the paper, immunological memory to SARS-CoV-2

26:29.680 --> 26:36.240
 assessed for up to eight months after infection. This is by Shane Crotty, an Los Androsetti's

26:36.240 --> 26:43.440
 group. And this was in science. But, you know, here there's a couple things that we saw. And I'm

26:43.440 --> 26:50.800
 going to throw in words like only to sort of emphasize things. Only 70% of individuals possessed

26:50.800 --> 26:58.240
 detectable CD8 positive T cell memory at one month after infection that declined to 50% by

26:58.240 --> 27:06.880
 six to eight months after infection. Not great, but CD4 T cell memory. 93% of subjects had

27:06.880 --> 27:12.320
 detectable SARS-CoV-2 memory at a month after infection. And this remained high for six to eight

27:12.320 --> 27:20.560
 months. So we also see T follicular helper cells being maintained. So we're sort of getting

27:20.560 --> 27:29.760
 mixed here. Now, we did have the preprint also by these same gentleman, low dose mRNA 1273 COVID-19

27:29.760 --> 27:36.240
 vaccine generates durable T cell memory and antibodies enhanced by preexisting cross-reactive T cell

27:36.240 --> 27:44.960
 memory, where they report that spike. CD8 positive T cells were generated in 88% of subjects

27:44.960 --> 27:49.600
 with equivalent percentages of CD8 positive T cell memory responders at six months post

27:49.600 --> 27:56.160
 vaccine. So you're sort of seeing here that there looks like when we're looking at these lab-based

27:56.160 --> 28:01.600
 studies of B cells T cells and serology, vaccines do look like they're a little bit better. And we

28:01.600 --> 28:06.960
 have good data on the efficacy. We also have the reinfection studies. That's sort of when the

28:06.960 --> 28:12.800
 rubber meets the road. And what happens when people have had natural infection and now they're

28:12.800 --> 28:19.120
 exposed again. And I think we discussed before the siren study out of England. And that was SARS-CoV-2

28:19.120 --> 28:23.840
 infection rates of antibody positive compared with antibody negative health care workers in

28:23.840 --> 28:31.760
 England, a large multi-center prospective cohort study siren. And here this was Lancet suggesting

28:31.760 --> 28:38.960
 a median duration effect of seven months at about 83% from prior infection with the same variant,

28:38.960 --> 28:44.880
 right? So sort of raises concerns. And then we have this growing experience. What are we seeing

28:44.880 --> 28:50.240
 as clinicians? And we are seeing our own growing experience of people who were infected early in

28:50.240 --> 28:58.240
 the pandemic. So a year or more ago, now coming in, testing PCR positive, having symptoms and some

28:58.240 --> 29:03.120
 of them not doing well. I think I may have shared the experience of the young woman who had long

29:03.120 --> 29:08.880
 COVID after first infection, did not get a vaccine. And a couple weeks ago, she started to get ill

29:08.880 --> 29:14.640
 again and again had a second infection. And I think now people ask, oh, can you test to see if

29:14.640 --> 29:22.000
 it's a delta variant? Well, it's almost 90% of the sequences we're now seeing across the country are

29:22.000 --> 29:28.480
 delta variants. So I think that, you know, the data may not be as compelling as some of the

29:28.480 --> 29:34.320
 anti vaccinators or the hesitant might want to be. But we have really good compelling data on the

29:34.320 --> 29:40.080
 safety and efficacy of vaccine. So we are across the board recommending that all people get vaccinated

29:40.080 --> 29:48.480
 even if they have prior infection. All right. Now the period of detectable viral replication,

29:48.480 --> 29:53.760
 this is going to be an exciting part. I'm looking for some emails. We had some very

29:53.760 --> 29:59.280
 disturbing news, right? So this is the time for monitoring and monoclonals, not the time for

29:59.280 --> 30:06.560
 antibiotics. But there was a bit of drama because a preprint that had been posted,

30:06.560 --> 30:13.440
 suggesting that a randomized control trial demonstrated a 90% reduction in mortality and

30:13.440 --> 30:22.160
 substantial in Ivermectin treated patients may have been something that never happened. So a London

30:22.160 --> 30:27.600
 medical student named Jack Lawrence was the Woodward and Bernstein in this story, if people

30:27.600 --> 30:33.840
 remember all the president's men. And he was investigating this preprint. And he discovered

30:33.840 --> 30:39.440
 initially that the introductory section of the document appeared to have been almost entirely

30:39.440 --> 30:45.840
 plagiarized and then run through a Thesaurus program. And it appears that the authors,

30:46.800 --> 30:52.720
 they pulled entire paragraphs out of press releases and websites about Ivermectin.

30:53.360 --> 30:58.800
 And then they changed these key words. The data appears to have been completely falsified.

30:58.800 --> 31:04.560
 The tables in the article mathematically impossible. Apparently the study never happened.

31:04.560 --> 31:10.720
 They just invented the study, invented the data, put it out there, really just a case of scientific

31:10.720 --> 31:17.040
 fraud. So this data was part of a lot of these meta-analysis where people were saying,

31:17.040 --> 31:22.080
 Oh, Ivermectin, it looks so promising. It's a crime to humanity that we're not using it when

31:22.080 --> 31:28.720
 there's this study with a 90% mortality reduction. My hope is that all the people that have braced

31:28.720 --> 31:35.280
 Ivermectin and are using it based on this kind of data will rethink their position and embrace

31:35.280 --> 31:43.360
 the importance of honest scientific investigation. So now if someone is passionate about Ivermectin

31:43.360 --> 31:49.200
 and they want to know, don't just make up data, don't just invent a study and put a preprint

31:50.080 --> 31:57.440
 right now. And we've talked a little bit about this active sex, the COVID-19 study of repurposed

31:57.440 --> 32:06.000
 medications is recruiting to properly study Ivermectin, fluvoxamine, and fluticosome. So

32:06.000 --> 32:11.280
 if you're passionate, if you're excited about Ivermectin, you know, either enroll, direct your

32:11.280 --> 32:18.400
 patients this way. We need good science, don't just make up science. All right.

32:20.240 --> 32:25.440
 A little more information on the reliability of point of care rapid testing with the Abbott by

32:25.440 --> 32:31.920
 next now with the publication of multidisciplinary assessment of the Abbott by next now SARS-CoV-2

32:31.920 --> 32:37.520
 point of care antigen test in the context of emerging viral variants and self administration

32:38.080 --> 32:43.280
 was published in nature scientific reports. And I know a lot of people I get, you know, at least

32:43.280 --> 32:48.720
 every day, hey, do our tests still work against the Delta variant. You know, and I've talked a

32:48.720 --> 32:54.880
 little bit about, you know, how it may go from these low level to high levels in hours instead of a

32:54.880 --> 33:03.760
 day plus. And so what the authors here looked at the by next now, they looked at the Quidel

33:03.760 --> 33:12.160
 Sophia to SARS test. They looked at the BD barator. They were all 100% concorded with RTPCR with

33:12.160 --> 33:19.920
 CT values of less than 20. And then they started to lose sensitivity at higher CT values, or we

33:19.920 --> 33:27.280
 translate that into lower RNA levels. So just a reminder, CT stands for cycle threshold. This

33:27.280 --> 33:33.280
 is how many times you've got to run that PCR or that amplification before you get a positive

33:33.280 --> 33:39.840
 signal. The higher the number of cycles, the lower amount of RNA that you started with.

33:40.960 --> 33:45.120
 And as Vincent likes to point out, that's just RNA. That doesn't necessarily tell us about

33:45.120 --> 33:52.240
 infectious virus. All right. And I think there's a correlation more in time than levels. So that's

33:52.240 --> 33:59.200
 important. But what about this? You know, I get calls all the time. You know, is there one rapid

33:59.200 --> 34:03.760
 test better than the other? And there are a lot of publications that come out and it seems like

34:03.760 --> 34:08.640
 every time a publication comes out, I get a question. And just to give some context here,

34:08.640 --> 34:16.080
 there are over 300 COVID-19 tests and collection kits authorized by the FDA. Over 200 molecular

34:16.080 --> 34:23.840
 tests, we have 11 antigen tests. What about this? So the specificity, right? People say,

34:23.840 --> 34:27.600
 Oh, well, not only are they're less sensitive, but they're less specific. If I get a positive

34:27.600 --> 34:33.760
 on an antigen, I don't trust it as much. I'm going to say that if you get a positive test,

34:33.760 --> 34:41.920
 the specificity of antigen tests is generally as high as our nucleic acid amplification tests,

34:41.920 --> 34:50.800
 which means that a positive test on an antigen test is as reliable as a positive test on a PCR.

34:51.840 --> 34:56.400
 There's a lot of experience, right? But just remember your prevalence of the community is

34:56.400 --> 35:01.920
 going to help you interpret whether that positive test makes sensor or not. Now, what about

35:01.920 --> 35:08.480
 sensitivity? Really straightforward. This is related to the amount of antigen that is present.

35:08.480 --> 35:14.480
 If it's the first couple days that one to three days that corresponds with a CT value of less than

35:14.480 --> 35:19.440
 20, as pointed out, we're getting sensitivities. We're getting concordance right up there at about

35:19.440 --> 35:26.240
 100%. Once you get out to day seven, day eight, when that RNA level is dropping, when you're not

35:26.240 --> 35:30.320
 really having much in the way of antigen, these tests are going to turn negative. So they're actually

35:30.320 --> 35:35.520
 helpful when you think about what it's testing for. These are great at picking up that infectious

35:35.520 --> 35:40.320
 period of time. They correspond with the infectious period of time. PCRs can sometimes stay positive

35:40.320 --> 35:46.240
 for weeks for months. All right. And there was a really nice, I'm going to say Cochrane review,

35:46.240 --> 35:51.840
 which they keep updating. Rapid point of care antigen and molecular-based tests for diagnosis

35:51.840 --> 36:01.680
 of SARS-CoV-2. This is a 409-page document. So a nice light read. And it goes through different

36:01.680 --> 36:07.920
 tests, their sensitivity and specificity at different CT levels. And so it's an excellent

36:07.920 --> 36:16.160
 document. So don't let that latest publication shake your Earth, go ahead, look at this accumulation

36:16.160 --> 36:22.240
 of data. Rapid point of care antigen tests have a role. That testing delay is leaving someone

36:22.240 --> 36:27.680
 who's potentially infectious, wandering around, spreading it to others. All right. Another article

36:28.400 --> 36:35.920
 on it describes that water is wet. Smart Chrysoplexus say. This is how antibacterial therapy is not

36:35.920 --> 36:42.000
 helpful for the treatment of a virus. And this is the article effective oral azithromycin versus

36:42.000 --> 36:49.840
 placebo on COVID-19 symptoms in outpatients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, a randomized control trial

36:49.840 --> 36:54.960
 published in JAMA. And I think this is interesting. Some people think that, well, maybe the azithromycin

36:54.960 --> 37:00.560
 will make my patient feel a little bit better. It does not. You're just, you know, inducing

37:00.560 --> 37:06.160
 antibacterial resistance. So they did not see that antibiotics help viral infections.

37:06.160 --> 37:15.280
 All right. We're getting near the end. So long COVID, right? I mentioned last time that post

37:15.280 --> 37:19.200
 acute COVID syndrome. Apparently, when you're on a call with the CDC, they don't like the word.

37:19.200 --> 37:24.800
 They don't like the phrase long COVID. They feel happier when you say packs. But I like long COVID

37:24.800 --> 37:30.800
 because I think it actually points to something within the larger world of packs of post acute

37:30.800 --> 37:35.360
 COVID syndromes. But what about the rest of the world? We talked about the U.S. and the UK.

37:35.360 --> 37:40.880
 So we did see the article post discharge symptoms among hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Nigeria,

37:40.880 --> 37:45.600
 a single center study, published in the American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.

37:46.320 --> 37:52.000
 And basically, what they were pointing out is this was a small study, but the majority of their

37:52.000 --> 37:58.960
 discharged patients were actually having symptoms continuing for months after discharge.

37:58.960 --> 38:04.960
 I know a lot of people, you know, were very focused on the U.S., but outside the U.S., things

38:04.960 --> 38:12.400
 continue to be really difficult. There was a nice paper, COVID-19 therapeutics for low and

38:12.400 --> 38:19.120
 middle-income countries, a review of candidate agents with potential for near-term use and impact.

38:20.160 --> 38:26.080
 And this was actually, you know, I think what you would expect. You've got to think about the

38:26.080 --> 38:32.240
 resources in the area relative, you know, injectable tools, expensive therapies are not going to

38:32.240 --> 38:38.000
 be able to play as big a part in this area. And there was actually a nice article,

38:39.600 --> 38:45.200
 COVID-19 in Africa, a lesson in solidarity published in Lancet. Actually, my friend,

38:45.200 --> 38:51.280
 Dr. Titus DiBali from Malawi brought this to my attention. But just pointing out, you can't just

38:51.280 --> 38:57.120
 send vaccines to these countries. The same complexity applies there. You've got to have needles,

38:57.120 --> 39:01.520
 you've got to have syringes, you've got to have trained people, and you actually have

39:01.520 --> 39:07.040
 vaccine hesitancy and an interest in education in these areas, just like you do in the United

39:07.040 --> 39:12.080
 States and Western Europe in many parts of the world. So to get those vaccines into arms

39:12.720 --> 39:18.640
 is going to require a pretty large effort. And I actually made Vincent record this a little

39:18.640 --> 39:25.040
 earlier today, because I'm going to be talking with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation COVID-19

39:25.040 --> 39:32.240
 Task Force later to talk a little bit about these challenges. So as I like to say, we are not safe

39:32.240 --> 39:38.240
 until everyone is safe. And to conclude on that note, just a couple weeks left here

39:38.880 --> 39:44.720
 for our campaign to support Foundation International Medical Relief of Children. So go to parasites

39:44.720 --> 39:50.000
 without borders. Before the end of July, we will double your donation. We're going to try to get up

39:50.000 --> 39:56.480
 to a level where we can double that $20,000 and give a full $40,000 to support Foundation

39:56.480 --> 39:59.280
 International Medical Relief of Children's efforts throughout the world.

40:00.400 --> 40:06.800
 Daniel, when I went to our new office this week, I walked in and the lady shouted,

40:06.800 --> 40:16.720
 parasites is here. All right, time for some questions for Daniel. You can send yours to

40:16.720 --> 40:24.720
 Daniel at microbe.tv Kevin writes his favorite public speakers are Barack Obama and Dr. Daniel

40:24.720 --> 40:31.600
 Griffin. All right, he has a question about his grandfather's immunization status in February.

40:31.600 --> 40:38.160
 He got mRNA vaccine four days later tested positive for COVID. Thanks to your advocacy. I got

40:38.160 --> 40:44.560
 him monoclonal therapy infection passed. My grandfather had only mild disease following CDC

40:44.560 --> 40:50.080
 recommendation. He waited three months before getting the second dose of the mRNA vaccine. Last

40:50.080 --> 40:56.480
 time we checked CDC recommendation for someone in the same circumstances does not need to restart

40:56.480 --> 41:00.720
 the vaccine schedule. However, we're a little concerned that perhaps his first dose did not

41:00.720 --> 41:04.800
 prime his immune system as well. What are your thoughts? We'd like to think he's well immunized

41:05.840 --> 41:10.880
 after natural infection and at least one good dose of mRNA vaccine, but we're not completely

41:10.880 --> 41:18.880
 confident. Yeah, so this is a great question. I suspect we're in a good situation here, right?

41:18.880 --> 41:24.000
 There was a period of time at least where the immune system was learning from that first infection

41:24.000 --> 41:31.920
 before the monoclonals jumped in there. That is the current recommendation. There's a science

41:31.920 --> 41:36.960
 and there's an equity side to this, right, where should we be giving third doses to people when

41:36.960 --> 41:41.440
 so much of the world hasn't even had their first dose? So a situation like this, you're

41:41.440 --> 41:47.680
 probably in good shape. What we have sometimes done is if there's doses that might end up in

41:47.680 --> 41:52.160
 the trash because we've had a no show, an individual like this might look at the whole picture and

41:52.160 --> 41:56.880
 try to make a decision there relative to that. But no, this is the recommendation we think that

41:56.880 --> 42:02.400
 this individual is protected, definitely a lot better protected than someone who has had no

42:02.400 --> 42:08.880
 vaccination. Frank writes, why do you not mention the use of daily rapid tests at school as a high

42:08.880 --> 42:14.640
 quality method eliminating COVID without restricting socialization? A dollar per student per day is

42:14.640 --> 42:20.160
 not a burden. If the answer is waiting for FDA approval and high volume manufacturing, we need

42:20.160 --> 42:26.640
 to know that and put more pressure on representatives. No, so, and actually when I've talked about

42:26.640 --> 42:34.000
 schools in camps, rapid testing, actually testing can be a really important part of your multi-layered

42:34.000 --> 42:38.160
 approach to keeping the kids safe. One of the things I will throw out, I think this is important

42:38.160 --> 42:43.120
 as a thought experiment, right? Let's say you've got all these layers of protection, you want it,

42:43.120 --> 42:47.520
 you're looking to try to get those masks off, right? So those kids can be in person in school with

42:47.520 --> 42:54.400
 masks off. Let's say you have a breakdown and in that class of 25 individuals, you miss, right?

42:54.400 --> 42:59.440
 Because the sensitivity of the test, someone comes in on a Monday, it's negative, you test

42:59.440 --> 43:04.800
 Tuesday, they're positive, you realize, okay, if everyone's wearing masks, you may not have had

43:04.800 --> 43:08.720
 an exposure event, you may have actually been able to avoid that, you may be able to move

43:08.720 --> 43:13.040
 forward with only that one person coming out of the school. So you got to sort of balance this

43:13.040 --> 43:18.400
 issue, is wearing masks such a burden that you're willing to take the risk of exposure events and

43:18.400 --> 43:24.240
 all those implications? Or are you okay wearing masks in certain settings? So should there be a

43:24.240 --> 43:29.120
 failure of your layers that you're not pulling everyone out for the quarantine and everything

43:29.120 --> 43:35.680
 that sort of follows from that. And Laura from New Mexico writes, as COVID infections continue

43:35.680 --> 43:42.320
 to rise, is it advisable for a fully vaccinated person who ends up with an infection to get monoclonal

43:42.320 --> 43:47.760
 antibody treatment? I live in a somewhat medically underserved area, keep notes on the recommended

43:47.760 --> 43:52.480
 treatment approaches. Should I need to be an advocate for myself or a loved one? My immediate

43:52.480 --> 43:56.080
 family and the majority of my regular contacts are fully vaccinated, but I want to be prepared

43:56.080 --> 44:04.400
 for the uptick in cases that is starting. Yeah, it is the role of monoclonals is not impacted by

44:04.400 --> 44:10.160
 prior vaccination. So if an individual who has risk factors for progressing to severe disease

44:10.160 --> 44:16.720
 does test positive, go right ahead with the monoclonals. Remember, the vaccines are great,

44:17.360 --> 44:23.920
 but nothing's 100%. We have had a few hundred people, so it's a one in a million chance of dying

44:23.920 --> 44:29.120
 if you get COVID. We've also had some people, I hate to say at least there are reports of individuals

44:29.120 --> 44:33.920
 who got infected after a vaccine and ended up in the hospital or got long COVID. Go ahead,

44:33.920 --> 44:38.320
 get the monoclonals. There's no reason not to, they're sitting on shelves, they're paid for by the

44:38.320 --> 44:47.040
 government. So go ahead. And that's COVID-19 clinical update number 72 with Dr. Daniel Griffin.

44:47.040 --> 45:16.880
 Thank you, Daniel. Oh, thank you. And everyone be safe.
