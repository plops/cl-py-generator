 This week in virology, the podcast about viruses, the kind that make you sick.

00:10.400 --> 00:20.960
 From Microbe TV, this is Twiv. This week in virology, Episode 689 recorded on December 3, 2020.

00:20.960 --> 00:27.040
 I'm Vincent Racken Yello, and you're listening to the podcast all about viruses. Joining me

00:27.040 --> 00:34.720
 today from New York, Daniel Griffin. Hello, everyone. Vincent, do I say hello everyone or

00:34.720 --> 00:38.800
 hello everybody? I think I alternate, right? I don't think it matters whatever you feel like

00:38.800 --> 00:44.720
 on a given night. Yeah. All right, so let me start. I was emailing with my buddy, Peter Hotez,

00:44.720 --> 00:52.160
 earlier today. And he was on the recent, what was it, stick to the Vax? I think that was a

00:52.160 --> 00:57.840
 pun on stick to the Vax maybe. Peter Hotez, I'm going to, I'm going to put a disclaimer right up

00:57.840 --> 01:02.880
 front. So, you know, this is similar to what you might hear when you get on an airplane. And they

01:02.880 --> 01:07.520
 say, you know, this flight is headed to San Francisco. So if that is not your final destination,

01:07.520 --> 01:13.600
 you might want to get off now. Right. And, you know, it may seem a while ago, but you know,

01:13.600 --> 01:18.080
 when we started these, it was actually, I had come to Vincent, our listeners may not know this

01:18.080 --> 01:23.920
 backstory. But we were trying to keep all the, all the physicians here in the New York Tri-State

01:23.920 --> 01:29.200
 area updated on, you know, what we were learning, what was happening. And Vincent very generously

01:29.200 --> 01:33.760
 sort of offered this forum as a chance for us to sort of once a week share that knowledge.

01:34.720 --> 01:40.240
 So these updates started back in March. And it was all about, you know, what we were learning

01:40.240 --> 01:44.720
 about COVID, the therapeutics, what we were seeing firsthand as practicing clinicians.

01:44.720 --> 01:50.080
 So, you know, it's really what we're here to share is the truth of what we're seeing. There's

01:50.080 --> 01:54.560
 no real agenda here. We're not trying to grow any audience. At some point, maybe Vincent will

01:54.560 --> 01:59.040
 kick me off if, you know, no one wants to listen to me anymore. But this has been, I think,

01:59.040 --> 02:03.680
 a tremendous service. So I want to thank Vincent for that. But I will say this is, there's no warm

02:03.680 --> 02:08.480
 soup here. I'm not here to make these difficult times easier. I'm just here to basically share

02:08.480 --> 02:14.080
 what's going on, what we're learning, the cold, hard truth. Oddly enough, I think some anti-vaxxers,

02:14.080 --> 02:19.280
 I've been told the word trolls is applicable here at times. But, you know, for the next 30

02:19.280 --> 02:27.040
 minutes, we're not going to talk about anti-vaxx theories. So if you tuned in accidentally to the

02:27.040 --> 02:32.080
 wrong podcast, this might be time to jump off the next 30 minutes, you're never going to get them

02:32.080 --> 02:39.440
 back. So, you know, spend them well. Okay. Now that I have made my disclaimer, my quotation,

02:39.440 --> 02:46.880
 one ought never to turn one's back on a threatened danger, but to try to run away from it. If you

02:46.880 --> 02:51.920
 do that, you will double the danger. But if you meet it promptly and without flinching, you will

02:51.920 --> 02:59.200
 reduce the danger by half. And can people guess who that's, that's Winston again. I like Winston

02:59.200 --> 03:05.040
 Churchill. Now, these are, these are dark times already. People keep saying, oh, we've got a dark

03:05.040 --> 03:09.680
 winter ahead of us. But you know, there are over 100,000 Americans in the hospital right now with

03:09.680 --> 03:18.080
 COVID-19. And, you know, yesterday, the numbers were almost 3000 today, we have over 3000 people

03:18.080 --> 03:23.920
 who died here in the US of COVID-19. We've reached capacity at the hospitals here in New York.

03:25.040 --> 03:28.640
 You know, I got a alert from one of the hospitals yesterday, you know, we have, you know,

03:29.360 --> 03:34.560
 numbers of people stuck here in the ER because there's no open beds. The ICUs are overflowing

03:34.560 --> 03:40.880
 into the other areas. This is not a great sign. I mean, we are not even seeing the post Thanksgiving

03:40.880 --> 03:47.360
 search. So just want people to sort of think about when they're making their decisions. We are as

03:47.360 --> 03:52.400
 bad right now as it has ever gotten. More people died today than have ever died in a single day

03:52.400 --> 03:58.080
 from COVID-19 here in the States. More people are in the hospital right now with COVID-19 than ever.

03:58.080 --> 04:05.040
 So really think about that. All right, let's move through our phases, our pre-exposure period.

04:05.840 --> 04:11.280
 A little update here for our clinicians. I got a lot of questions about this. New York has now

04:11.280 --> 04:16.640
 recommended broader use of eye protection. And I know we've talked a little bit about the science

04:16.640 --> 04:20.800
 behind this. You know, it takes a little while for the recommendations to catch up with the

04:20.800 --> 04:25.840
 science, but New York State Department of Health now strongly recommends universal use of eye

04:25.840 --> 04:31.120
 protection by healthcare personnel for all patient interactions. And this is in addition to the

04:31.120 --> 04:36.560
 face masks. And I got an email sort of asking about this and it was entertaining. So it was a whole

04:36.560 --> 04:41.440
 loop. You know, it was a number of clinicians in a clinic and one of them emailed me saying,

04:41.440 --> 04:45.520
 you know, we only do well visits. We don't let people come in if they're sick and not sure if

04:45.520 --> 04:51.200
 this really applies to me. And so I responded back and said, you think they're well visits.

04:51.200 --> 04:56.320
 But you know, what percent of those people are pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic? And that's

04:56.320 --> 05:00.720
 really the thing. If you get a call the next day and they say, you know what, I wasn't feeling 100%

05:00.720 --> 05:04.880
 when I saw you. And today I just got a test. And you were not wearing your eye protection.

05:05.920 --> 05:11.440
 That's a potential exposure. So, you know, this is really moving into a universal precautions

05:11.440 --> 05:17.840
 approach, at least for the foreseeable future here. You know, for front facing healthcare workers,

05:17.840 --> 05:23.120
 we'll talk about why there is a finite period of time that we're going to need to be practicing

05:23.120 --> 05:29.040
 this really high level of caution. But universal recommendation here in New York when clinicians

05:29.040 --> 05:34.400
 are interacting. And I extend this to all staff. When you're within that six feet, when you're

05:34.400 --> 05:40.160
 going to potentially be at risk, protect your mouth, protect your nose and protect your eyes.

05:41.600 --> 05:47.360
 People are still taking zinc, vitamin D, vitamin C. This all seems fine. And there was a nice

05:47.360 --> 05:54.640
 article in nature, analysis of vitamin D levels among asymptomatic and critically ill COVID-19

05:54.640 --> 06:00.400
 patients. And it's correlation with inflammatory markers. But you know, I'm going to sort of push

06:00.400 --> 06:05.360
 out here again, say we really need to do some randomized control trials. I mean, we currently

06:05.360 --> 06:12.080
 in the US spend over a billion dollars a year, over a billion dollars a year on vitamin D supplements

06:12.080 --> 06:17.920
 and testing. That's a lot of money. It would be nice to know, like, you know, is that being,

06:17.920 --> 06:23.440
 is that well spent money? So, you know, if it's not, then you could give a little bit of that,

06:23.440 --> 06:29.280
 you know, Vincent in the lab. So, you know, or support micro TV. But no, it's, it's important.

06:29.280 --> 06:33.200
 You know, we do a lot of, we do a lot of studies looking at, you know, small molecule inhibitors,

06:33.200 --> 06:37.360
 pharmaceutical agents. Vitamin D is something a lot of people take for a lot of different

06:37.360 --> 06:44.400
 reasons. It would make sense to really understand its role in COVID-19. I also want to talk about

06:44.400 --> 06:48.880
 testing here, right? This is hopefully the pre-exposure period. Hopefully you haven't been

06:48.880 --> 06:54.000
 exposed yet. And we really ramped up testing over the last couple weeks here. I was doing in

06:54.960 --> 06:59.520
 one of those, I call them the microphone bokeh interviews this morning. You know,

06:59.520 --> 07:03.040
 you've got a whole bunch of microphones and, you know, you're not sure who you're talking to,

07:03.040 --> 07:08.560
 but you look at the, the sea of cameras. And we were talking about what we've done with

07:09.440 --> 07:14.400
 rapid testing in the last few weeks. You know, and I was there with Bonnie Simmons. She's the

07:14.400 --> 07:20.320
 head of our Tri-State Urgent Cares. She's my buddy, Adam Fitterstein's boss. And she just, you know,

07:20.320 --> 07:22.960
 she always wonders, again, you know, ever I call you pick up the phone, I'm like,

07:22.960 --> 07:27.680
 Bonnie, you're kind of a hero of mine. You know, you really allowed us to make this happen,

07:27.680 --> 07:33.920
 all this rapid testing. And what we saw right before Thanksgiving is a lot of people were going

07:33.920 --> 07:39.520
 and getting tested. A lot of people with asymptomatic and presymptomatic infections were being picked

07:39.520 --> 07:45.120
 up, diagnosed, sort of pulled out, contact tracing, and then those people were being picked out. And

07:45.120 --> 07:48.800
 I really think, you know, we were, we were saving lives here. We were detecting people

07:48.800 --> 07:53.200
 before they went to those gatherings. We were picking up who else was infected that they were

07:53.200 --> 07:59.440
 interacting with. And so this is really, really taken on and people are realizing the utility.

08:00.000 --> 08:05.680
 You know, two days before symptoms, five days of symptoms, the rapid test gives you a result in

08:05.680 --> 08:11.360
 about 15 minutes has really been tremendous. This is free, right? This is something that we,

08:11.360 --> 08:15.120
 you know, as a society are picking up. This is not something we charged people for.

08:15.760 --> 08:20.160
 And I was there this morning. It was quite cold. And there were two lines of cars, you know,

08:20.160 --> 08:24.000
 and just sort of going around the quarter. And these were all people that were basically driving

08:24.000 --> 08:29.120
 up, getting swab, they would then drive on. And by the time they got to work, school, home,

08:30.000 --> 08:33.840
 they would be alerted by the results and basically told like, you know, if you just got to work,

08:33.840 --> 08:39.280
 stay in your car, turn around, go home. Or otherwise, all right, you're clear and can move forward. So

08:40.400 --> 08:45.280
 so much more helpful than, you know, finding out in four or five days after you've exposed

08:45.280 --> 08:50.160
 people that oh, by the way, when you went to that Thanksgiving dinner, when you went to work, when

08:50.160 --> 08:54.240
 you went to school, you were shedding fire really embracing this. And a lot of people are moving

08:54.240 --> 09:02.000
 in this direction. Now vaccines. All right. I'll call this better than vitamin D, right? If you

09:02.000 --> 09:06.480
 have a choice, a good vaccine or vitamin D, I'm going with the vaccine. I might also, at some

09:06.480 --> 09:10.720
 point remember to take some of that vitamin D that's still sitting on the shelf in my medicine

09:10.720 --> 09:17.600
 cabinet, only growing in value, I'm sure. So we got more information. And it's always amazing as I

09:17.600 --> 09:22.880
 was like, how is this really only the last week? It always seems like old news, but we got more

09:22.880 --> 09:29.120
 information on the Moderna vaccine. And Moderna has now applied for EUA for their vaccine. And some

09:29.120 --> 09:34.160
 of this was covered in the previous 12. So listen for more in depth there. But what do we as clinicians

09:34.160 --> 09:43.520
 are going to bullet point this? Moderna reported a vaccine efficacy of about 94.1%. And if you

09:43.520 --> 09:49.680
 looked at the secondary endpoint, severe disease, 100%, no one who received the Moderna vaccine ended

09:49.680 --> 09:57.600
 up requiring an ER visit or hospital care. It also was reported that the vaccine was well tolerated.

09:57.600 --> 10:02.560
 There were no serious safety concerns. And I'll sort of make the point here, the difference

10:02.560 --> 10:08.640
 between reactogenicity and severe adverse effects. You get the vaccine, feel a little under the

10:08.640 --> 10:14.720
 weather for a day or two. Shane Crotty has been tweeting out. I've been retweeting this. It's

10:14.720 --> 10:18.880
 the rock, Dwayne Reed, the rock. And he goes to the gym. And he's really sore the next day. That's

10:18.880 --> 10:24.640
 kind of what it's like. That's the reactogenicity. That's your immune system learning. And then

10:24.640 --> 10:29.360
 you move forward, but no serious safety concerns. And now we have about 70,000 people that have

10:29.360 --> 10:35.600
 been vaccinated. We've got months of this. So we've exceeded two months of median follow-up

10:35.600 --> 10:43.040
 post vaccination as required by the US FDA for the EUA. So we'll be seeing that reviewed on the 17th.

10:43.040 --> 10:48.560
 That's the other bullet point. Thursday, December 17th, the Moderna vaccine is scheduled to be

10:48.560 --> 10:57.120
 reviewed. What do we know so far? This primary analysis that we got is an update 196 cases,

10:57.120 --> 11:06.080
 of which 185 cases of COVID-19 were observed in the placebo group. Only 11 cases in the vaccinated

11:06.080 --> 11:13.200
 group. And then as mentioned, all the severe cases were in people that had not gotten vaccinated.

11:14.080 --> 11:19.760
 Someone died. And that was another person who did not get vaccinated. So pretty impressive. So

11:19.760 --> 11:25.280
 between Pfizer and Moderna projections are that we should have enough vaccine for approximately 40

11:25.280 --> 11:31.120
 million doses by the end of this month. We expect to start vaccinating people this month.

11:32.400 --> 11:37.920
 70 million doses per month starting in January of projection as we will have the ability to

11:37.920 --> 11:44.240
 vaccinate 100 million Americans by the end of February. Pfizer Ultra cold vaccine did just get

11:44.240 --> 11:49.120
 approval in the UK. So people probably have heard about that. So I'm just going to hit a couple

11:49.120 --> 11:56.400
 important dates for our clinicians to keep an eye on. One already passed December 1st, the ACIP.

11:56.400 --> 12:00.800
 This is the advisory committee on vaccines. And this was a little bit different, right?

12:00.800 --> 12:06.160
 Normally this committee meets after a vaccine is licensed, and then they give advice on who should

12:06.160 --> 12:11.040
 get it. So this is a little bit of a twist. They met and they said, so when a vaccine gets

12:11.040 --> 12:16.480
 an EUA, we're going to give some preemptive recommendations on who should be prioritized.

12:16.480 --> 12:21.920
 And my wife really liked this because initially they had, we're going to have phase one and two

12:21.920 --> 12:27.680
 and sort of down the line. So what they did is they created phase one A, B, and C. This is

12:27.680 --> 12:35.280
 the way a whole bunch of people are in phase one. So I thought that was clever. And what they did

12:35.280 --> 12:39.440
 basically is nothing that surprised anyone. They said, hey, we're going to do healthcare workers

12:39.440 --> 12:45.760
 right up front. And then we're going to sort of move down the line. We'll be moving into educators

12:45.760 --> 12:52.560
 and firefighters and police officers and people in food and sort of really like critical people.

12:52.560 --> 12:58.160
 And then we're going to move into phase one C. And that's the 65 and over. So I'm going to talk

12:58.160 --> 13:02.080
 a little bit about one. I think people will actually see the vaccine. So December 10th,

13:02.080 --> 13:07.120
 that's a week from the time we're recording this. The FDA will review the Pfizer vaccine.

13:07.840 --> 13:14.320
 December 17th, the FDA will review the Moderna vaccine. And just to talk a little bit about the

13:14.320 --> 13:20.560
 numbers, front facing healthcare workers, this is phase one a healthcare personnel. And this

13:20.560 --> 13:26.560
 includes like, you know, EMTs, EMS, and also that it's going to move right into the long term care

13:26.560 --> 13:31.600
 facility residents. You too, right? This is all. What's that? Are you included in that?

13:32.800 --> 13:36.480
 In the long term care facility resident or the health care health care?

13:36.480 --> 13:45.600
 I am actually. Yeah. I'm actually, you know, I think I was talking with people I work with and

13:45.600 --> 13:50.880
 may have I think I may have seen more COVID patients or had more exposure to COVID patients

13:50.880 --> 13:56.400
 than anyone else I know. So yeah, I have a lot of exposure. You know, I go see people in the ER,

13:56.400 --> 14:01.200
 see people in the ICU, I see people, you know, out in the urgent care settings as well in the

14:01.200 --> 14:07.360
 clinics. So yeah, if you can get exposed to COVID, I make it my business. So Daniel,

14:07.360 --> 14:11.520
 are you going to feel somewhat relieved that you have a vaccine?

14:13.120 --> 14:17.920
 Tremendously, tremendously relieved, actually. You know, and this I'm going to answer that

14:17.920 --> 14:20.560
 question. I keep skirting, right? People keep saying, Dan, you know, are you going to get the

14:20.560 --> 14:25.280
 vaccine and when, you know, and I heard Barack Obama, he's like, can I get the vaccine as soon as it's

14:25.280 --> 14:29.680
 ready? You know, and I think that's the thing. A week from today, when we're recording this on

14:29.680 --> 14:34.240
 Thursday, so a week from today, the FDA is going to have the review of the Pfizer vaccine. All the

14:34.240 --> 14:38.800
 information is going to be out. One of the people on our vaccine committee is going to be tasked

14:38.800 --> 14:43.920
 with, you know, listening to all the questions, reviewing all the data. So hopefully when we

14:43.920 --> 14:49.120
 record next time, I'll have all the information to go ahead and say, yes, I feel like this is safe

14:49.120 --> 14:54.320
 where ready to go. Or if something comes up, I'll let people know otherwise. But yeah, I anticipate

14:54.320 --> 15:00.880
 a little more than a week after this drops. I'll be getting in line for my vaccine and planning on

15:01.440 --> 15:06.800
 I'll stream that live on YouTube or something. Get someone to tape it on your iPhone, record it

15:06.800 --> 15:12.400
 on your iPhone, we can splice it in here. Okay, yeah, because I think I think that that will help

15:12.400 --> 15:16.320
 people. You know, you want to see someone, you know, I was talking to my mom earlier today,

15:16.320 --> 15:20.240
 I answered it no one other than the truth. And she's like, yes, well aware of that.

15:20.240 --> 15:27.040
 So yeah, I'm going to get the vaccine if I feel like it's safe and effective. And I think that

15:27.040 --> 15:30.320
 that will sort of help get the message out there. But I don't think it's safe and effective. I'm

15:30.320 --> 15:36.800
 going to I'm going to wait until I feel confident. So hopefully that'll help our listeners. So yeah,

15:36.800 --> 15:42.720
 phase one A is going to start in December, we are all ramped up and ready to go. Then we move into

15:42.720 --> 15:48.480
 phase one B and that's all the essential workers I mentioned. So education, food and agriculture,

15:48.480 --> 15:53.520
 police, firefighters, correctional officers, transportation, that's going to start in January.

15:53.520 --> 15:58.320
 And then phase one C, that's 65 and over. That's sort of our high risk. That's going to be January

15:58.320 --> 16:05.520
 moving into February. So this is really happening pretty quick. So this is good stuff. Once we once

16:05.520 --> 16:10.560
 we move into March, that's when we're really moving into wider distribution. And children,

16:10.560 --> 16:15.120
 people wonder about children has been tested on children yet. But Pfizer has announced that

16:15.120 --> 16:20.160
 they're going to be starting to test in the 12 to 18 year old population. They're going to have

16:20.160 --> 16:27.200
 3000 people in that initial venture, I should say, Moderna has also said they're going to be moving

16:27.200 --> 16:31.760
 their vaccine into that population as well. So we're going to have important information on can

16:31.760 --> 16:37.840
 we use this vaccine in younger individuals. 18 is kind of arbitrary, right? I'm not sure how

16:37.840 --> 16:44.080
 immunology and the right to vote somehow peg that 18. And I was worried when they raised a drinking

16:44.080 --> 16:50.000
 age to 21 that that would somehow but now I mean, I'm really arbitrary there. So I did want to talk

16:50.000 --> 16:56.640
 a little bit actually about this whole ultra cold thing with Pfizer, right? And we always talk about

16:56.640 --> 17:01.920
 vaccine hesitancy. And we're talking about the patients being hesitant. But unfortunately, I think

17:01.920 --> 17:06.880
 because of some issues with communication here, we've had vaccine hesitancy on the part of

17:06.880 --> 17:11.120
 clinics, physicians, healthcare organizations saying, you know, I just don't want to have to

17:11.120 --> 17:15.360
 deal with Pfizer and this ultra cold. And I don't want to buy these deep freezers.

17:15.360 --> 17:19.280
 Or the other side is you have all these people spending really a lot of money

17:19.280 --> 17:24.880
 buying these, you know, these freezers. So I'll talk a little bit about this. So I'm on this

17:24.880 --> 17:32.320
 National Vaccine Initiative Committee. And actually, Wednesday, so yesterday, I was in a meeting

17:32.320 --> 17:38.640
 with basically our whole group and Pfizer's medical director. This is, I believe, Catherine

17:38.640 --> 17:45.120
 Jansen is her name, really bright woman. After the after the conversation, I talked to John

17:45.120 --> 17:51.520
 hit who's like our senior person. And he was actually saying, you know, I guess when you have a lot

17:51.520 --> 17:58.560
 of money, you can hire really good people. So I was impressed by that. But they've really

17:58.560 --> 18:03.920
 figured this stuff out. It's pretty amazing. They've got these thermal shippers, which really are

18:03.920 --> 18:09.200
 a little bit larger than we'll say like five personal pizza boxes. So it's really five personal

18:09.200 --> 18:15.600
 pizza boxes. Each personal pizza box has about 200 miles, actually, 195 miles, five doses per

18:15.600 --> 18:21.440
 mile. And they're in this box surrounded by dry ice. We'll talk a little about dry ice.

18:22.240 --> 18:30.320
 And basically send this out. So five, you know, you could say 195 times five. So about 1000 doses

18:30.320 --> 18:35.520
 in this thermal shipper. And that thermal shipper itself is basically a deep freezer. You know,

18:35.520 --> 18:40.080
 you repack it with dry ice every few days, everything is in there. You don't have to buy one of these

18:40.080 --> 18:45.520
 deep freezers. It's small enough that it fits under a desk. They even spend, they even send you these

18:45.520 --> 18:49.440
 special thermal gloves. I asked about that on the call. I'm like, how am I going to touch those,

18:49.440 --> 18:54.000
 you know, negative 70 degree things? Because I remember, you know, going into the deep freeze,

18:54.000 --> 18:58.720
 you know, and you pull it out and you get freezer burn on your fingers. So they send goggles,

18:58.720 --> 19:03.760
 they send special gloves, you grab as many vials as you want, let them come up to room temperature,

19:04.400 --> 19:09.760
 add some saline, inverted a few times, and then fill your syringes. So it's really,

19:10.320 --> 19:15.440
 really user friendly, really something that can get out there. And it's actually something not

19:15.440 --> 19:18.720
 only that I think we're going to do here in the US, but there's already plans to use the same

19:18.720 --> 19:23.520
 technology throughout Sub-Saharan Africa, you know, low middle income countries as well. So

19:23.520 --> 19:30.000
 really no issues here. Everyone should start getting signed up, registered so they can make

19:30.000 --> 19:35.760
 this happen. You get your first dose with Pfizer, three weeks later, you get your second dose,

19:35.760 --> 19:40.720
 and within five days, you are at these wonderful levels of protection that we've all heard about.

19:40.720 --> 19:45.120
 Just want to sort of let people know that this whole cold storage, ultra cold stuff,

19:45.120 --> 19:50.640
 it's really not an issue. Pfizer's worked this out. And so there'll be a little details adjusted

19:50.640 --> 19:55.040
 at sort of the endpoint once the FDA comes and says, this is exactly the way we want you to do

19:55.040 --> 19:59.840
 it. How many times can you recharge that thermal freezer with your, you know, with your, what kind

19:59.840 --> 20:06.560
 of ice is that? Dry ice. And I promised I would mention dry ice. And I'm going to make a video

20:06.560 --> 20:11.520
 this weekend on homemade drugs, because everyone's like, Oh my gosh, we're going to run out of dry

20:11.520 --> 20:17.520
 ice. And it's really easy to make. And you know, don't try this at home. People will listen and do

20:17.520 --> 20:22.320
 that when I say that. But you know, you can really just take one of those CO2 fire extinguishers

20:22.320 --> 20:27.440
 and a cloth bag and either tape it or have a really good glove and you blast into the bag and

20:27.440 --> 20:32.480
 presto, you have dry ice. So I'll be, I'll be blasting that on Twitter this weekend. But

20:32.480 --> 20:37.120
 yeah, we're not going to run out of dry ice. It's easy to make dry ice. We've got lots of CO2.

20:37.120 --> 20:42.480
 We're good to go. Apparently, there was a CO2 shortage in England a couple of years back. You

20:42.480 --> 20:47.200
 know, they couldn't make beer or something. So nothing to worry about. All right, let's move

20:47.200 --> 20:54.240
 into our incubation post exposure period. That little changes here, right? The CDC updated its

20:54.240 --> 20:59.520
 guidance. And they basically said, this makes sense. I've been talking about this for a little

20:59.520 --> 21:04.240
 while, but now it's official. You know, when we used to say you got exposed, now you got to

21:04.240 --> 21:10.640
 quarantine for 14 days, my wife, her famous, that's excessive. So yeah, she's right. Nobody did that.

21:10.640 --> 21:16.160
 So now what they've said is what you can do is at the end of seven days, get a test.

21:16.160 --> 21:21.520
 If the test is negative, then you can move forward. So that was just updated December 2nd.

21:22.480 --> 21:26.880
 And this does not need to be a PCR. They don't specify that you can go ahead and get your rapid

21:26.880 --> 21:32.720
 test 15 minutes later, you find out you're good to go, you move forward. So I say that's, that's

21:32.720 --> 21:38.720
 really positive. All right, now we move into the viral symptom phase. Now, unfortunately,

21:38.720 --> 21:42.800
 you have you have not missed the bullet. You've actually got infected. You're starting to have

21:42.800 --> 21:51.280
 symptoms, just some monoclonal antibody updates. You know, people, people have not really forgotten

21:51.280 --> 21:57.600
 about the monoclonal antibodies. There still tends to be a tremendous demand. And actually,

21:57.600 --> 22:03.680
 when this when this episode drops on Saturday, there'll be some stuff in the news about Eli

22:03.680 --> 22:08.560
 Lilly and my involvement with them. So tell people to watch the news and we'll talk more about this

22:08.560 --> 22:13.680
 next week. But I did want to add a little bit of a discussion. I was listening to TWIV 688.

22:14.560 --> 22:19.040
 And there was a whole discussion about subcutaneous versus intradermal and the half life of the

22:19.040 --> 22:25.680
 antibodies. You know, it reminded me of of rabies when the when the woman who wrote in was talking

22:25.680 --> 22:30.320
 about injecting herself in the belly and all these different things. So just a couple of things to

22:30.320 --> 22:35.280
 talk about. So intradermal, if anyone ever had their their skin test for tuberculosis,

22:35.280 --> 22:39.120
 that's where you put the needle just a little under the skin and you raise a little blab,

22:39.120 --> 22:45.120
 that's intradermal. That's in the skin. Subcutaneous is sort of down in the fat layer,

22:45.120 --> 22:49.360
 but above the muscle. So you're not getting into the muscle, you're, you know, you pull a nice chunk

22:49.360 --> 22:54.320
 of fat. It's easy to do on me, particularly because I don't go to the gym anymore. But, you know,

22:54.320 --> 23:00.640
 one day it'll be harder, hopefully. You know, the rest of my life is so hard. Why is my belly so soft?

23:00.640 --> 23:06.400
 But you grab a nice chunk and you put the injection in there. The reason we're studying monoclonal

23:06.400 --> 23:11.200
 antibodies in the subcutaneous is you don't have to go to a clinic. You don't have to go to a hospital.

23:11.200 --> 23:16.320
 Anyone can grab a nice chunk and inject in the way they do with Proleia, for instance, some of our

23:16.320 --> 23:21.600
 other medicines. So we're studying that as well. Why do you do four different sites? It's a question

23:21.600 --> 23:27.680
 of volume at this point. It's just sort of a large volume. What about half-life? The half-life

23:27.680 --> 23:33.920
 is different with the different antibody preparations. So the Eli Lilly, the BAM BAM, the BAM Linibin

23:33.920 --> 23:38.960
 map, half-life is about 21 days. They get a really high dose. 21 days, it's about half of that.

23:40.240 --> 23:45.520
 The half-life is a little bit longer with the Regeneron antibodies. And I think I mentioned

23:45.520 --> 23:50.480
 GSK has made a stock modification, so there anybody has an even longer half-life. So

23:51.280 --> 23:56.000
 next thing I guess I'll mention is that this is passive immunity. So when you give someone this

23:56.000 --> 24:02.480
 infusion or you do the subcutaneous injection, then you're not going to see an immune response.

24:02.480 --> 24:06.240
 You're not going to see lymph nodes. You're not going to see soreness at the site.

24:06.240 --> 24:11.120
 About 2% of the time people get a little bit itchy. So that's why we sort of observed them.

24:11.120 --> 24:14.480
 Get a little bit itchy. We give them Benadryl has been an issue to date. So

24:15.600 --> 24:23.040
 making some progress there. The early inflammatory phase. People should go back and listen to

24:23.040 --> 24:29.920
 immune 39, a Tonka truck full of salt. And they have a discussion right at about 57 minutes about

24:29.920 --> 24:38.160
 the cytokine storm. And the whole early inflammatory response is really a sophisticated, complicated

24:38.160 --> 24:45.200
 thing. And it reminded me of a book and a movie based on the same book, Smilla Sense of Snow,

24:45.200 --> 24:50.560
 written by the Danish author Peter Hogue. And the main character is a Greenlander.

24:50.560 --> 24:55.520
 And she presents this idea that a lot of people have heard where the Inuit have multiple words

24:55.520 --> 25:01.360
 for snow. I think in this book, it's 23. The myth is that there are 50. And I think it's sort of

25:01.360 --> 25:05.360
 an interesting discussion when we're talking about this early inflammatory phase and we talk

25:05.360 --> 25:13.360
 about cytokine storms. Really, there's a lot of complexity here. And I think that you get the

25:13.360 --> 25:18.160
 immunologist response. It's very complicated. But from a therapeutic point of view,

25:18.160 --> 25:24.160
 we're still limited in what we do here. We still use steroids during this period. We still do

25:24.160 --> 25:30.240
 oxygen. We still do medications to prevent people against cloth. So a lot of supportive care.

25:31.120 --> 25:36.160
 Secondary infection phase. We're actually, I think I mentioned last time, but we're starting to see

25:36.160 --> 25:42.000
 more issues here with resistant organisms because of sort of overuse of antibiotics early on. So

25:42.000 --> 25:46.880
 let's really be careful sort of a reminder there to all our clinicians. If you see these people in

25:46.880 --> 25:53.120
 the urgent care, you see people in the outpatient setting, what do you do? You might get them hooked

25:53.120 --> 25:57.840
 up with a pulse oximeter. You might monitor them. You want to make that decision. Do they need to

25:57.840 --> 26:03.840
 come in the hospital? You might consider aspirin, things like that. But no antibiotics is a viral

26:03.840 --> 26:08.880
 illness. You want to be really careful. If you're giving more than 10% of your COVID patients

26:08.880 --> 26:14.240
 antibiotics, you're overdoing it. Most patients can be managed at home without antibiotics

26:14.240 --> 26:20.320
 with really not hospitalization in most cases. But if they do need to be in the hospital, if they

26:20.320 --> 26:25.600
 get to this late phase, this is when we start seeing those infections. The multi-system

26:25.600 --> 26:31.360
 inflammatory phase, it was like a deja vu back to April today. I don't know if that works right,

26:31.360 --> 26:39.520
 but anyway, early on in April, we talked a bit about the Irish patients. I don't know if our

26:39.520 --> 26:44.960
 listeners who are with us still remember that. Our Irish patient had an episode at one point

26:44.960 --> 26:49.760
 where things seem to be going along really well. I'm thinking this is great. We come in and he's

26:49.760 --> 26:55.760
 completely paralyzed. If our listeners remember that. Same thing happened over the last two days

26:55.760 --> 27:01.120
 with one of my patients in the ICU. They're getting to the end of week four. We're starting to talk

27:01.120 --> 27:07.440
 about discharge planning, getting this person set up with rehab, and completely paralyzed.

27:07.440 --> 27:12.800
 And again, this is this Guillain-Barre syndrome that we see as part of this multi-system inflammatory

27:12.800 --> 27:18.400
 phase. So that individual has been started on IVIG. It's a 5D treatment that we use.

27:19.280 --> 27:25.280
 And the motor comes right back. So sort of a frightening thing. But I think now that we

27:25.280 --> 27:29.920
 understand it, this sort of shows the difference in managing patients. Back we first saw this in

27:29.920 --> 27:34.160
 April, we did not know what was going on. What's happening, this person was doing so well, suddenly

27:34.160 --> 27:38.720
 they're paralyzed. And they're on a ventilator because they can't breathe on their own. But now

27:38.720 --> 27:44.800
 we understand where this fits in. The tail phase, I'm going to finish off here because we've got a

27:44.800 --> 27:50.080
 few emails. And my goal is to keep this all under 30 minutes. And I'm going to suggest that we

27:50.080 --> 27:55.760
 create some kind of survey to decide what to call this tail phase. Now it's been recognized. Is it

27:55.760 --> 28:02.080
 long COVID? Is it long haul trucker COVID? Is it long term COVID? Is it long lasting COVID?

28:02.080 --> 28:07.200
 Is it post COVID? And actually, I'll let our listeners know that we're recording this on

28:07.200 --> 28:15.360
 Thursday. But there is a large semi multi hour conference going on today Thursday and Friday,

28:15.360 --> 28:20.960
 where a lot of clinicians, a lot of researchers are all having an NIH sponsored discussion,

28:20.960 --> 28:26.160
 trying to better understand not only what's going on here, but how to put together research

28:26.160 --> 28:29.840
 projects to try to get a better understanding of how to take care of some of these folks.

28:29.840 --> 28:36.560
 So I'll stop there before we hit emails and just remind everyone that we have we have finished our

28:36.560 --> 28:43.760
 microbe TV fundraiser, which went very well. I'm happy to say we're going to be able to

28:43.760 --> 28:49.760
 generously support microbe TV, which is great. But we're we're now supporting the peace course,

28:49.760 --> 28:56.640
 HIV and AIDS programs. Just remember that the other virus is still responsible for a lot of

28:56.640 --> 29:00.880
 suffering and death throughout the world. So encourage people to go to parasites without borders.com.

29:00.880 --> 29:05.360
 So we can do our matching support for the months of December and January.

29:06.080 --> 29:12.480
 All right. So last time we made a new email address for Daniel Daniel at microbe.tv so you can send

29:13.520 --> 29:18.480
 the emails there. And I, I save him the trouble of getting them. Actually, they come to me,

29:18.480 --> 29:22.480
 but they're still for Daniel and we have a bunch. So let's do a couple.

29:22.480 --> 29:29.200
 All right, I'm going to lump the first two together. Both Joy and Dennis are worried about

29:29.200 --> 29:35.600
 long term COVID. They wanted, you know, they say they both have it. And what can be done? Are there

29:35.600 --> 29:42.800
 any therapeutics in sight? And I've gotten this question many times, Daniel. So what can you tell

29:42.800 --> 29:48.560
 us? Yeah, I mean, that was I think really encouraging about what what is going on today. What's going

29:48.560 --> 29:53.600
 on tomorrow is that it is recognized that this is a phenomenon. It is recognized that these people

29:53.600 --> 29:59.360
 are suffering and that we need to really bring science to bear. This can't be just, oh, try some

29:59.360 --> 30:04.480
 mana histamine, see if the melatonin helps you sleep. We need to really get these people together.

30:04.480 --> 30:10.400
 So a couple of things I will say is at United in research, I've mentioned that website before,

30:11.040 --> 30:17.920
 we are going to basically create a COVID positive community. And we are going to basically give

30:17.920 --> 30:24.880
 people a way to go on the web to register a citizen scientist and to basically participate in the

30:24.880 --> 30:30.720
 different trials and the different approaches to how do we understand what's going on with people

30:30.720 --> 30:35.760
 who continue to suffer from COVID. And we're going to be following serologies. There'll be

30:35.760 --> 30:40.880
 questionnaires. There'll be all kinds of biomarker analysis. So it's going to be a lot of individuals

30:40.880 --> 30:45.440
 looking at this. I will say at this point, we still have sort of primitive where we focus on

30:45.440 --> 30:51.680
 symptoms, but this is going to be moving hopefully to better therapeutics. But there are thousands

30:51.680 --> 30:58.400
 and hundreds of thousands of individuals suffering with this post COVID syndrome.

30:58.400 --> 31:04.720
 And we're committed to finding answers. All right. Next one is from Chaim who lives in

31:04.720 --> 31:09.600
 Washington, D.C. And he says, my kid's school is doing almost everything right, distancing,

31:09.600 --> 31:14.960
 mask wearing, you know, no moving around, no testing, unfortunate. He says there's no testing

31:14.960 --> 31:22.080
 as in addition to practical issues, they seem to be worried about moral hazard. Anyway, new cases

31:22.080 --> 31:26.960
 are spiking here in D.C. We are now cresting the record set at the peak in May. Mayor has tightened

31:26.960 --> 31:32.880
 some restrictions, but indoor dining still permitted. So I think things are going to get worse. His

31:32.880 --> 31:37.760
 question, is there a point at which we should be pulling our son out of school? Obviously, I don't

31:37.760 --> 31:42.880
 expect an exact threshold, but conceptually, does it make sense that at some point the background

31:42.880 --> 31:48.560
 might get high enough to overwhelm the in school precautions? Or are the safety measures enough

31:48.560 --> 31:53.840
 that we don't have to worry about community spread outside the school? Yeah, you know, I've always

31:53.840 --> 31:57.840
 get questions about the schools. And I think that this is important. I'm going to be doing another

31:57.840 --> 32:02.160
 talk for one of the schools this Sunday. And I think Shane Crotty is going to be like going

32:02.160 --> 32:10.640
 before me, actually, so my buddy Shane Crotty. The science is mounting. The evidence is that you

32:10.640 --> 32:15.440
 can make schools a safe place. That doesn't mean everyone's making it a safe place, but you can do

32:15.440 --> 32:21.280
 it. So as you describe, if they put all these proper mitigation measures in place, if they,

32:21.280 --> 32:26.480
 you know, keep the kids separated, if they wear masks, and watch that they're not indoor dining

32:26.480 --> 32:32.880
 at school. And I really commend my son, who's always horrified that, you know, they sit too close

32:32.880 --> 32:38.800
 when people eat. And that is true, Barnaby, you should be horrified like I am. We can make schools

32:38.800 --> 32:44.240
 safe. The interesting thing is not only have I been weighing in and giving advice and sort of

32:44.240 --> 32:49.680
 commenting on schools in the New York area, but actually throughout the country, my first involvement

32:49.680 --> 32:57.360
 in schools was actually in March in Texas. And I still remember the conversation. So this was the

32:57.360 --> 33:03.200
 superintendent of one of the largest school districts in Texas. And, you know, he asked me,

33:03.200 --> 33:09.280
 and I've known him for a while. So he said, you know, Dan, you know, what do you think? Should we

33:09.280 --> 33:14.720
 close the schools? And I said, you know what, you can either close them now, or you can wait until

33:14.720 --> 33:19.600
 it's too late. And that was back. We didn't understand back in March, we didn't know that we could

33:19.600 --> 33:24.400
 make schools a safe place. So this is a different scenario. And I don't think it's like, Oh, just

33:24.400 --> 33:28.640
 in New York, you have resources can make the schools safe. I've talked to schools throughout

33:28.640 --> 33:35.680
 the country, we can make schools safe in Idaho, in Texas, in Montana, in California, in Colorado.

33:36.880 --> 33:41.920
 And and that's that's one of the things. So so I'll go ahead and say, I'm not sure closing schools

33:41.920 --> 33:47.120
 makes a lot of sense, even here in New York City, where real estate and space is actually quite tough.

33:48.320 --> 33:53.520
 The New York City mayor wants to open the schools again, and wants to do it in a way that they

33:53.520 --> 33:58.880
 think is safe, because there are clear harms to closing the schools. And the teachers, you know,

33:58.880 --> 34:04.960
 I'm thinking about teachers here too, they can be made safe. If if we do what we know works,

34:05.600 --> 34:09.920
 if we don't give the masks, if we don't put measures in place, if we don't have the distancing,

34:09.920 --> 34:14.480
 that's a problem. The other thing that is right around the corner, right, the rainbow at the end

34:14.480 --> 34:19.760
 of this dark tunnel is right after we do the healthcare workers, we're going to start vaccinating

34:19.760 --> 34:25.280
 the teachers. So in the in the coming months, the teachers are going to be safe as well. And I

34:25.280 --> 34:29.600
 think that's really going to help us with opening schools. All right, one more from Paul, who is in

34:29.600 --> 34:37.840
 Manchester UK. He sends a link to a BBC article about lung damage and wants to hear Dr. Griffin's

34:37.840 --> 34:44.320
 thoughts. This is an article about a new scanning mechanism that has identified lung damage months

34:44.320 --> 34:52.240
 after the initial infection. I think about this. Yeah, you know, I actually appreciate that you

34:52.240 --> 35:00.000
 bring this up, Paul. You know, if anything, I think people underestimate the damage, the morbidity

35:00.000 --> 35:05.200
 of COVID-19, you know, some less than wise people have sort of said, Oh, COVID either, you know,

35:05.200 --> 35:13.280
 you get it and either live or you die. Yeah, no, most people who get COVID don't just live or die.

35:13.280 --> 35:18.880
 A lot of the people that don't die are really negatively impacted. And we see the people with

35:18.880 --> 35:25.600
 the long haul, the tale of COVID. But there's also a lot of individuals who were physically

35:25.600 --> 35:31.360
 active and they find themselves compromised. We've had several several serious athletes who find

35:31.360 --> 35:35.120
 that, you know, they went from running six, seven miles a day to having trouble going up the flight

35:35.120 --> 35:40.320
 of stairs. We're appreciating that there can be for a lot of individuals much more lung damage

35:40.320 --> 35:46.720
 than was initially appreciated. We're also recognizing heart damage as well. So I think these studies

35:46.720 --> 35:52.400
 are really important to let people know that you really want to not get COVID. Because yeah,

35:52.400 --> 35:56.480
 you may survive, you may come out the other side, you may be able to tell everyone how great you're

35:56.480 --> 36:01.760
 doing. But let's see you try to run a mile after you've had COVID. It may not go so well. So

36:02.720 --> 36:08.800
 let's really for the next few months until, and I guess this reminds me of my other movie as we'll

36:08.800 --> 36:13.440
 sort of finish here soon. This was, I watched Greyhound. It always takes about a week because I

36:13.440 --> 36:19.280
 watch in like seven minute increments. But this is a World War II and it's a shipping convoy and

36:19.280 --> 36:24.320
 they've they've left the safety of air cover of the US. And now they're heading towards air cover

36:24.320 --> 36:28.880
 over in England. You know, and they're how many hours till we're back in air cover. And that's

36:28.880 --> 36:34.960
 where we are right now. It's only weeks and months till we've got the air cover of the vaccine. So,

36:34.960 --> 36:39.840
 you know, let's just be safe. Let's zigzag. Let's let's avoid those crowds. Let's wear those masks.

36:39.840 --> 36:46.560
 Let's wash our hands so we can get back to the air cover of the vaccine and the pre COVID world.

36:47.920 --> 36:55.360
 All right. That's our COVID-19 clinical update number 39 from Dr. Daniel Griffin. Thank you, Daniel.

36:55.360 --> 37:10.240
 Oh, pleasure. It's always and everyone be safe.
