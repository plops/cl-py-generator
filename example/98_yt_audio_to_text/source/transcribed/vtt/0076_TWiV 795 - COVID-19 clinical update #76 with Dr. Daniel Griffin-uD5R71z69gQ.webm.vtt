00:00.000 --> 00:06.880
 This week in virology, the podcast about viruses, the kind that make you sick.

00:10.240 --> 00:20.960
 From Microbe TV, this is Twiv, this week in virology, episode 795, recorded on August 19th, 2021.

00:21.520 --> 00:26.800
 I'm Vincent Rack and Yellow, and you're listening to the podcast all about viruses. Joining me

00:26.800 --> 00:34.320
 today from New York, Daniel Griffin. Hello, everyone. Hey, Daniel, what do you think about

00:34.320 --> 00:40.880
 boosters? You going to talk about that today? I'm sure that will come up, but an episode will

00:40.880 --> 00:46.160
 not go by without discussing that hot topic. Every week, there's a hot topic, right?

00:47.120 --> 00:51.120
 You know, I keep thinking that there's going to be some point in time when it just settles down,

00:51.120 --> 00:56.240
 and I have nothing to say, and I look forward to that point in time. We're not there yet.

00:56.240 --> 01:06.160
 No, but this is update number 76. Yeah, maybe at update 100, we will reach that point.

01:07.280 --> 01:13.440
 Maybe that's optimism. When we get to clinical update 100, we'll see if I was optimistic or not.

01:13.440 --> 01:17.440
 All right. All right, well, let's get fired up because we got a lot to do today, and I'll start

01:17.440 --> 01:25.120
 with my quotation. There is only one sin, and that is theft. When you tell a lie, you steal

01:25.120 --> 01:29.440
 someone's right to the truth. And I don't know if I'm going to pronounce this correctly, but this

01:29.440 --> 01:38.000
 is by the author of the kite rudder, Kaleid Hasani. So maybe our writers can let us know if I pronounce

01:38.000 --> 01:46.320
 that correctly. Actually, I'm a great fan of this man's work, his books, and this has really been

01:46.320 --> 01:51.200
 a tough, really been a tough week, particularly in Afghanistan seeing what's happening there. So

01:52.080 --> 01:58.160
 Hart goes out to all those individuals. Now, I'd like to say a single point does not make a line,

01:58.160 --> 02:05.200
 so I'm going to keep building on the knowledge we have. But people know that here in the U.S.

02:05.200 --> 02:10.800
 things are not going well in a lot of parts of the country, but let's start off with children.

02:10.800 --> 02:17.680
 Children may be at low risk, but they are not at no risk, and I've added to this wearing a mask is

02:17.680 --> 02:23.920
 less traumatic for a child than being hospitalized. I think we're all aware that there's actually

02:23.920 --> 02:32.320
 been some rather odd behavior around this respiratory contagion and children. And we got the article

02:32.880 --> 02:38.720
 Association of Age and Pediatric Household Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 Infection published

02:38.720 --> 02:44.800
 in JAMA Pediatrics addressing some of the questions around children of various ages and

02:44.800 --> 02:50.560
 transmission. And I must say, when I brought up this study, my wife was like, well, I can tell

02:50.560 --> 02:57.440
 you what it's going to show. She was right spot on. So this was a cohort study where the authors

02:57.440 --> 03:06.000
 looked at 6,280 households that had pediatric index cases and of these, well, about a quarter.

03:06.000 --> 03:13.760
 So 1717 households, 27.3% experienced secondary transmission. So just to give you a sense,

03:14.400 --> 03:21.120
 this is a household with a child with COVID at about a quarter of them, despite doing whatever

03:21.120 --> 03:28.560
 precautions still had secondary transmission. So the authors reported that children aged zero

03:28.560 --> 03:31.600
 to three. So they're going to break this down by different age groups. And this could be the

03:31.600 --> 03:38.960
 question, who's going to be the highest rate of transmitting? So they're going to use age 14 to

03:38.960 --> 03:44.720
 17 as our sort of reference, our adolescents 14 to 17. And then we're going to compare

03:45.440 --> 03:50.320
 different age children to those folks. So looking at the zero to three years,

03:50.960 --> 03:55.840
 these individuals, the youngest, had the highest odds of transmitting SARS-CoV-2

03:55.840 --> 04:05.360
 to household context. Their odds ratio relative to the 14 to 17 was 1.43. And this association

04:05.360 --> 04:11.680
 was similarly observed in sensitivity, looking at secondary cases. And so basically going through

04:11.680 --> 04:19.440
 the older the kids were, when you got to four to eight, you had a slightly lower, was 1.4,

04:19.440 --> 04:27.120
 when you got up to the nine to 13, when you got up to these older. So the highest transmission

04:27.120 --> 04:33.520
 was in the youngest individual. So there's been this odd idea that I think our listeners are

04:33.520 --> 04:38.160
 probably aware of this odd idea that somehow children can't get COVID and that they can't

04:38.160 --> 04:47.440
 transmit, can't transmit the virus. So this is just basically letting us know that, yes,

04:47.440 --> 04:52.080
 if children do get infected, they can transmit it in the household context.

04:52.720 --> 04:59.360
 Now I'm going to move on to our testing transmission area. And I like to just remind people, I was

04:59.360 --> 05:04.240
 in the Brian Lair Show a couple days ago. And there was a whole question about rapid antigen

05:04.240 --> 05:11.520
 testing. Are we done with that? And just another study to remind people of how useful rapid

05:11.520 --> 05:18.560
 resulting tests can be. And this was the report use of rapid antigen testing for SARS-CoV-2

05:18.560 --> 05:25.520
 in remote communities, looking at Yukon, Cuskquim, Delta region, Alaska. And they looked at the

05:25.520 --> 05:34.080
 period of time from September 15, 2020 to March 1, 2021. And here, no surprise, the authors reported

05:34.080 --> 05:41.200
 that the introduction of rapid point of care antigen testing in this region was followed by

05:41.200 --> 05:48.080
 more than a threefold reduction in daily SARS-CoV-2 case rates. And this gets back to something

05:48.080 --> 05:54.240
 we've been talking about for well over a year now. And it's that one of the great things about

05:54.240 --> 05:59.120
 these point of care antigen tests is you get a result right away. You can quickly remove an

05:59.120 --> 06:04.400
 infected person from the transmission cycle, where particularly you look at an area like

06:04.400 --> 06:10.960
 remote Alaska to get a return PCR result can actually take a significant amount of time. And

06:10.960 --> 06:17.360
 during that time, that individual can continue to transmit the virus. And we still have on our

06:17.360 --> 06:21.760
 parasites without borders that calculator, where you can look at different sensitivities, different

06:21.760 --> 06:27.200
 approaches. And one of the things I was talking about is a lot of people have started to say,

06:27.200 --> 06:32.160
 this is not true, but they do say it, that, oh, these rapid antigen tests, they don't work for the

06:32.160 --> 06:39.120
 Delta variant. But remember, the Delta variant has some changes in the spike protein, still plenty

06:39.120 --> 06:43.680
 of nucleocapsid being produced. That's the protein we're picking up with these tests.

06:43.680 --> 06:50.160
 Are they 100% sensitive? 100% sensitive? No. But are they 80 or 90% sensitive when properly done?

06:50.160 --> 06:55.760
 Yes. So, you know, four out of five times, you're catching that person right away in 15 minutes.

06:55.760 --> 07:00.720
 If you're still concerned, you can still send off that secondary test. So it makes a lot of sense.

07:00.720 --> 07:06.560
 If they're positive, great. You can immediately intervene. If they're negative, and it doesn't

07:06.560 --> 07:12.640
 make sense, or you want to have a higher sensitivity, you can always add a PCR on top of rapid testing.

07:12.640 --> 07:17.040
 Now, in the MMWR, I'm sure Vince is going to jump in on this one.

07:17.680 --> 07:23.840
 Shedding of infectious SARS-CoV-2, despite vaccination when the Delta variant is prevalent,

07:23.840 --> 07:30.240
 Wisconsin July 2021 was posted as a preprint. Now, it was told to me, and I didn't actually see

07:30.240 --> 07:36.000
 this initially, but this was sort of tweeted my way that initially this was posted with the B-Wirt,

07:36.560 --> 07:40.400
 and they updated it because they knew that we would find that B-Wirt offensive,

07:40.400 --> 07:47.680
 and they decided to use a much more appropriate term, just infectious cases in vaccinated

07:47.680 --> 07:53.600
 individuals. So I have that on unreliable authority. I probably should have asked one of the authors

07:53.600 --> 07:59.680
 when I was emailing with him. But in this report, in this preprint using PCR cycle thresholds,

07:59.680 --> 08:06.640
 CT data, they actually went ahead and they looked at, can we actually culture

08:07.520 --> 08:13.200
 virus from these individuals? And they report that, yes, in the majority of individuals

08:13.920 --> 08:20.960
 with CT values less than 25, whether vaccinated or unvaccinated, they were able to actually culture

08:20.960 --> 08:30.080
 virus. So they did this in Vero cells. They report in Figure 2 that they were able to see

08:30.080 --> 08:37.200
 cytopathic effects after five days of replication in the Vero E6 TMPR SS2 cells.

08:38.720 --> 08:43.680
 But we don't get any quantification. And that's really what I was hoping because

08:43.680 --> 08:49.360
 the really question is, does this add anything? We know that vaccinated people can get infected.

08:49.360 --> 08:53.920
 We know that vaccinated people can transmit. So we already sort of knew going into this that there

08:53.920 --> 09:00.080
 had to be replication, competent virus there. The real question is, do those CT values mean

09:00.080 --> 09:06.160
 the same thing in a vaccinated and unvaccinated person at one point in time? Because we do know

09:06.160 --> 09:12.080
 that that CT value drops more quickly in vaccinated individuals. So I reached out to Dave O'Connor,

09:12.080 --> 09:18.160
 who actually was on Twiv 260 with Thomas Friedrich. So I'll call them your colleagues. I don't know

09:18.160 --> 09:23.840
 if you guys are friends. And I really wanted to know a couple of things. Hopefully we could

09:23.840 --> 09:29.440
 start using the terminology viral RNA load instead of just viral load, because we don't know if this

09:29.440 --> 09:36.720
 is virus. We know it's RNA load. But I still really want to know the quantification. So Vincent,

09:36.720 --> 09:38.720
 I thought you would have comments on this paper.

09:39.920 --> 09:47.520
 I think this is almost criminal to publish, because as you say, they simply take the

09:47.520 --> 09:52.320
 nasopharyngeal wash and throw it on cells and culture, and they get infection. There could be

09:53.120 --> 10:01.040
 one pfu in the vaccine sample and many more in the unvaccinated sample. So the authors say,

10:01.600 --> 10:06.320
 our data substantiate the idea that vaccinated individuals who become infected with Delta may

10:06.320 --> 10:12.080
 have the potential to transmit. Actually, it doesn't substantiate it at all. It makes no

10:12.080 --> 10:17.200
 conclusions possible. And I'm really surprised that they're trying to publish this. And you know,

10:17.200 --> 10:22.960
 the problem, Daniel, is it's a nuance that the mass media is not going to pick up. And that's a

10:22.960 --> 10:28.880
 problem. Yeah, I mean, this is the we've entered this different world, right, the world of preprints.

10:29.600 --> 10:35.360
 And I did reach out to Dave O'Connor. He emailed me back that they are going to actually are in

10:35.360 --> 10:41.040
 the process of looking at the quantification of the cytopathic effects. And that's really what

10:41.040 --> 10:45.600
 you need. So this, yeah, by the time it gets published, we'll have that. The only problem in

10:45.600 --> 10:49.760
 and I agree with you in the preprint world. And I've been sort of glad the media hasn't jumped too

10:49.760 --> 10:55.840
 much on this. This quickly becomes confirmation of this idea that vaccinated people are driving

10:55.840 --> 11:01.520
 the pandemic that vaccines are failing. And none of that is true. We are still seeing

11:02.160 --> 11:05.760
 vaccines are incredibly effective. And we'll get into that as we discuss

11:06.320 --> 11:11.760
 boosters when we get into active vaccination. So all right, I will return to this paper. I hope

11:11.760 --> 11:19.040
 when we have some quantification data there, but the sky has not fallen. Well, on the 12th day

11:19.040 --> 11:28.400
 of August 2021, the FDA said let there be boosters. And so they went ahead. The US FDA amended the

11:28.400 --> 11:34.720
 emergency use authorization for both the Pfizer by and tech COVID-19 vaccine and the Moderna COVID-19

11:34.720 --> 11:40.720
 vaccine to allow for an additional dose in certain individuals. Now, what did I like about this

11:40.720 --> 11:45.600
 announcement? Well, what I liked Vincent and listeners is that when they did this, they threw

11:45.600 --> 11:49.760
 a line in where they said it is recommended that immunocompromised individuals discuss

11:49.760 --> 11:54.320
 monoclonal antibody treatment options with their health care provider should they contract or

11:54.320 --> 12:02.320
 be exposed to COVID-19. So what do we do have great science that an individual who gets infected,

12:02.320 --> 12:07.680
 who is at high risk if they get the monoclonal antibodies that this really is associated with

12:07.680 --> 12:14.480
 a reduction in their chance of a bad outcome. But do we know whether or not a third dose of

12:14.480 --> 12:21.040
 vaccine will give them benefit? And I'm going to say as we move forward, I'm going to return and

12:21.040 --> 12:26.160
 again say that we are still lacking that data. Yeah, we can get some antibody levels a bit higher,

12:26.160 --> 12:31.600
 but what does that really translate into? So who are these individuals who are now eligible?

12:31.600 --> 12:37.040
 And many of the states have already jumped on. And as of Monday, this has been happening in

12:37.040 --> 12:44.160
 several states. The CDC is recommending that moderately to severe immunocompromised people

12:44.960 --> 12:50.080
 can receive an additional dose. And this includes, I'm going to give the six categories.

12:50.080 --> 12:54.800
 One, been receiving active cancer treatment for tumors or cancers of the blood.

12:55.360 --> 12:59.680
 Two, received an organ transplant and are taking medicine to suppress the immune system.

12:59.680 --> 13:05.440
 Three, received a stem cell transplant within the last two years, or are taking medicine to

13:05.440 --> 13:11.920
 suppress the immune system. Four, moderately or severe primary immunodeficiency. Let me give

13:11.920 --> 13:18.720
 some examples, advanced or untreated HIV, or active treatment with high dose corticosteroids,

13:18.720 --> 13:25.520
 or other drugs that may suppress your immune system. Now, we do hear that on the 20th of

13:25.520 --> 13:31.840
 September, that week, booster is going to be rolled out to the entire population that's eligible

13:31.840 --> 13:37.600
 in the US. But if you look at these six categories, this is actually a very small subset. This is

13:37.600 --> 13:44.880
 not I'm 65 and overweight. This is not I have multiple medical comorbidities. These are really

13:45.920 --> 13:50.480
 severely moderately to severely immunocompromised people that have been added now.

13:50.480 --> 13:57.600
 And then again, the suggestion is that the third week of September, this will roll out to a larger

13:57.600 --> 14:03.680
 population. And don't worry, I'm going to hit some of the studies that supposedly support this

14:03.680 --> 14:13.360
 concept. Lots of vaccine mandates on April. So there was a new vaccine mandate for New York State.

14:13.360 --> 14:20.240
 And this came out on, I say April, but it's actually August 16th. I'm going to update that.

14:20.800 --> 14:27.760
 All healthcare workers in New York State will be required to be vaccinated by Monday, September 27th.

14:27.760 --> 14:33.360
 And this will include staff at hospitals, long-term care facilities, nursing homes, adult care,

14:33.360 --> 14:40.960
 and any other congregate care settings. And there will be certain vaccinations limited for

14:40.960 --> 14:46.160
 religious and medical reasons. But remember, those medical reasons are incredibly limited.

14:46.160 --> 14:51.120
 Basically, it's a person who had an adverse reaction to this vaccine, or one of the components of

14:51.120 --> 14:56.320
 this vaccine. It's not I have lupus. It's not I have high blood pressure. It's not I'm allergic

14:56.320 --> 15:01.840
 to bees or talcum powder. The medical exceptions are very narrow. So I know there's already a lot

15:01.840 --> 15:07.760
 of people running out to see if their family doctor will write them a note. Those notes really

15:07.760 --> 15:13.200
 are not going to mean much unless you have had an anaphylactic serious reaction to a component in

15:13.200 --> 15:19.040
 these vaccines. What about vaccines and variants? Who's to blame? That's what we like to do as a

15:19.040 --> 15:26.560
 society. Along the lines of no one is safe until anyone is safe. There was a preprint that I found

15:26.560 --> 15:32.720
 rather interesting. And this was full vaccination suppresses SARS-CoV-2 delta variant mutation

15:32.720 --> 15:39.840
 frequency. And it wasn't frequency. So just full vaccination suppresses SARS-CoV-2 delta variant

15:39.840 --> 15:47.760
 mutation frequency. Now, the authors analyzed SARS-CoV-2 delta variant sequences from Australia,

15:47.760 --> 15:55.680
 France, Germany, Indonesia, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal,

15:55.680 --> 16:01.840
 Singapore, Spain, Switzerland, Sweden, Turkey, the US and the UK. There was a lot of data. This

16:01.840 --> 16:09.600
 all came from the global initiative on sharing all influenza data. So this is the G said G-I-S-A-I-D.

16:10.640 --> 16:15.840
 And they had a number of different variant sequences. And they did. I don't know if anyone's

16:15.840 --> 16:24.080
 familiar with the Tahima D test. I lit that up. This was new to me. But really, I thought it was

16:24.080 --> 16:29.120
 interesting. In Figure 1, they show a mutational frequency on the y-axis. They show the fully

16:29.120 --> 16:36.000
 vaccinated rate. Really areas with high mutational frequency had low fully vaccinated rates.

16:36.000 --> 16:42.160
 Areas with low mutational frequency had lower fully vaccinated rates. This makes biological

16:42.160 --> 16:49.040
 sense. The more you give the virus a chance to replicate, you would expect higher mutational

16:49.040 --> 16:55.760
 frequencies. But I don't want people to run out and start yelling at the unvaccinated people

16:55.760 --> 17:01.120
 claiming that they are a menace to society based on this one paper. But it is an interesting

17:01.760 --> 17:04.640
 report. Vincent's got his hand up. Jump in, Vincent.

17:05.760 --> 17:10.640
 Actually, an incorrect interpretation. The mutation frequency is not affected,

17:10.640 --> 17:16.240
 because the mutation frequency of the virus is a constant. What is affected is selection

17:16.800 --> 17:23.440
 out of that pool of variants of ones with changes, depending on the factors that they

17:23.440 --> 17:28.880
 look at in this paper, vaccination in this point. It is not correct that vaccination

17:28.880 --> 17:33.760
 suppresses the mutation frequency. It suppresses the number of changes that you see ending up in

17:33.760 --> 17:38.400
 spike as a result of selection. Does it make sense? It makes a lot sense, because this is really

17:38.400 --> 17:44.400
 not looking at the mutational frequency as far as occurring. It is looking at an end product.

17:44.400 --> 17:49.120
 Exactly. I am sorry to keep in trouble. No, I think that is helpful.

17:49.120 --> 17:54.640
 Because I have a lot of questions from people. How do the mutation frequency is affected?

17:54.640 --> 17:56.560
 No, no, no, no, no. It is not.

17:57.840 --> 18:00.560
 I would like to, maybe we could say this is you get to roll the dice less.

18:02.080 --> 18:08.800
 Still get against the same number of you. All right. Now, boosters. This is the only reason

18:08.800 --> 18:13.200
 Vincent is here today. No, no, no. I am here every week for the same reason.

18:13.200 --> 18:19.440
 So this is the special secret data that we were, we were not allowed to know about,

18:19.440 --> 18:23.520
 but now it's being shared with us. So there were several, several reports that came out.

18:23.520 --> 18:29.600
 So one came out in the MMWR, effectiveness of the Pfizer, BioNTech, and Moderna vaccines

18:29.600 --> 18:34.640
 in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection among nursing home residents before and during widespread

18:34.640 --> 18:42.640
 circulation of the SARS-CoV-2 be 1617.2, the Delta variant, National Healthcare Safety Network,

18:42.640 --> 18:50.000
 March 1 through August 1, 2021. So this is an MMWR early release. And it's interesting,

18:50.000 --> 18:56.080
 I had a discussion with one of my colleagues about what were MMWRs? What were MMWR early releases

18:56.080 --> 19:00.640
 before the pandemic? Really, was there many people other than me and my infectious disease

19:00.640 --> 19:05.200
 colleagues that looked at these? And now they've become primetime. They're sort of being asked to

19:05.200 --> 19:10.000
 be something they weren't before this. And we'll get into that whole idea of asking something to be

19:10.000 --> 19:17.040
 something that it was not asked to be before. But in this weekly report, they looked at data

19:17.040 --> 19:24.000
 that was reported to CMS Centers for Medicaid and Medicare, certified skilled nursing facilities

19:24.000 --> 19:31.440
 or nursing homes. This was the National Healthcare Safety Network and analyzed to evaluate. And

19:31.440 --> 19:37.920
 this is interesting, the effectiveness of full vaccination with any of the two currently authorized

19:37.920 --> 19:46.640
 mRNA COVID-19 vaccines on effectiveness against infection, right? So this is where we're suddenly

19:46.640 --> 19:55.760
 asking vaccines to do something quite different. And so using 17,470, so I'm going to try that again,

19:55.760 --> 20:04.160
 17,407 weekly reports from almost 4,000 facilities from the pre-Delta period, adjusted effectiveness

20:04.160 --> 20:13.840
 against infection for any mRNA vaccine was reported to be 74.7%. They then followed it up with this

20:13.840 --> 20:22.080
 intermediate period where they reported it was 67.5. And then they looked at 85,593 weekly reports

20:22.080 --> 20:29.440
 from 14,917 facilities during the period when the Delta variant was becoming prevalent.

20:29.440 --> 20:35.280
 And here they reported an adjusted effectiveness against infection of 53%.

20:35.920 --> 20:41.120
 And they say this was similar for Pfizer, BioNTech, and Moderna. So the point I want to make,

20:41.120 --> 20:45.920
 and I'm Vince and I am sure you will jump in on this. So I'm already prompting you to do that,

20:45.920 --> 20:50.160
 is I was asked by someone today, said, I was watching a Fox News report and they're saying,

20:50.160 --> 20:55.600
 oh, these vaccines, look at this. If you had a vaccine that was as crummy as this, what would

20:55.600 --> 21:01.520
 you do? And I wanted to point out to this gentleman, we are suddenly asking the vaccines to do

21:01.520 --> 21:07.440
 something that the vaccines were not necessarily designed to do. We designed these vaccines.

21:07.440 --> 21:13.680
 Vaccines traditionally have protected us against disease, against serious disease ending up in

21:13.680 --> 21:20.880
 the hospital, dying. Suddenly these vaccines have a new superpower. They are actually protecting

21:20.880 --> 21:26.720
 people. They are effective against infection. I mean, this is tremendous and continues to be

21:26.720 --> 21:32.720
 tremendous. So I don't walk away with this being being worried. And now maybe we're saying we want

21:32.720 --> 21:37.680
 them to do this new superpower even better. And so we're asking if we give a third dose,

21:37.680 --> 21:42.640
 can we do even better effectiveness against infection? But this is not failure. This is actually

21:42.640 --> 21:47.280
 vaccines with a new superpower being asked to do even more. So Vincent, I don't know if you had a

21:47.280 --> 21:51.760
 comment. Well, the problem here is that, as you said, they're looking at infection. And the

21:51.760 --> 21:56.960
 infection efficacy declines because serum antibody declines after vaccination or infection. It always

21:56.960 --> 22:01.280
 does. It's not surprising. We just for other vaccines, we never really looked at infection.

22:01.280 --> 22:07.840
 We just looked at disease. And that's how these vaccines were tested. They do note this analysis

22:08.640 --> 22:13.360
 assessed VE against infection without being able to distinguish between asymptomatic and

22:13.360 --> 22:17.760
 symptomatic presentations. Additionally, valuations are needed to understand protection

22:17.760 --> 22:23.040
 against disease and nursing home residents. That's the key. And I bet it's not declining,

22:23.040 --> 22:26.640
 as you're probably going to tell us from some other studies that came out in the same issue.

22:27.680 --> 22:33.360
 Yes. So let's hit this a couple others, which I think are reassuring because there were a couple

22:33.360 --> 22:40.080
 other releases. So one was new COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations among adults by vaccination

22:40.080 --> 22:48.000
 status New York May 3rd through July 25, 2021. And so this is looking at real world effect of this,

22:48.000 --> 22:53.840
 the general population here in New York. And these authors link to information from four

22:53.840 --> 23:00.960
 large databases to construct a surveillance based cohort of adults age greater than or equal to 18

23:00.960 --> 23:10.240
 years residing in New York. And they found that new COVID-19 hospitalizations were 0.17 per 100,000

23:10.240 --> 23:18.800
 person days in the fully vaccinated compared with 2.03 per 100,000 person days among the unvaccinated.

23:19.360 --> 23:24.800
 And they concluded that the overall age adjusted vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization in

23:24.800 --> 23:34.640
 New York had remained relatively stable, 91.9 to 95.3%. I mean, so I have to say, this is what the

23:34.640 --> 23:41.840
 vaccines were designed to do. They continue to be highly effective in preventing hospitalization

23:41.840 --> 23:47.840
 greater than 90% for fully vaccinated New York residents, even during a period when the prevalence

23:47.840 --> 23:55.280
 of the Delta variant increased from less than 2% to greater than 80%. And when so many of the

23:55.280 --> 24:01.280
 non-pharmaceutical prevention strategies, the societal public health restrictions were eased.

24:01.280 --> 24:06.880
 So getting rid of the mask wearing, cranking those restaurants back up to 100% capacity

24:06.880 --> 24:09.840
 and the like. And a hand is up for Vincent Rackeniello.

24:09.840 --> 24:17.520
 And the same period when the hospitalization against hospitalization was steady, the VE against

24:17.520 --> 24:23.680
 infection went from 90 to 80% of decline. So it just goes to show a decline in preventing infection

24:23.680 --> 24:28.560
 doesn't matter. They know how to do it in New York state. Maybe you were involved with this

24:28.560 --> 24:34.960
 because it's done right. Now, along these same reassuring lines, I'm going to give you a third.

24:34.960 --> 24:40.000
 So hopefully people are going to walk away. Dr. Griffin, you started so for Lauren, but now

24:40.000 --> 24:45.360
 you're giving us good news, sustained effectiveness of Pfizer, biotech, and Moderna vaccines against

24:45.360 --> 24:52.240
 COVID-19 associated vaccines among adults. And this is United States March through July 2021.

24:52.960 --> 24:58.160
 And this is not just in New York, but here the investigators found again, the vaccine

24:58.160 --> 25:05.120
 effectiveness was 86%, two to 12 weeks after vaccination, 84% at 13 to 24 weeks. Really,

25:05.120 --> 25:10.800
 the vaccine effectiveness was sustained among groups at risk for severe COVID-19. So a second

25:10.800 --> 25:14.800
 study looking at a different population continuing to have some really reassuring.

25:16.160 --> 25:22.160
 So here's the big question. Where's the science? Why are we giving everyone third doses? Are we

25:22.160 --> 25:27.200
 just going to bump anybody levels? Do we really have evidence that this will translate into

25:27.200 --> 25:32.160
 real world benefit, keeping people out of hospital, keeping people from dying, keeping people from

25:32.160 --> 25:37.840
 getting sick, keeping people from ending up with long COVID? That's data we still need.

25:37.840 --> 25:44.080
 So booster or not, Daniel? You know, you know, Midston, I actually had a sleepless night about

25:44.080 --> 25:49.120
 this the other day because, you know, it came to me sort of this issue of I say, Oh, Dr. Griffin,

25:49.120 --> 25:54.000
 you're eligible for a third shot. Do you want one? And there really is this sort of embarrassing

25:54.000 --> 25:59.040
 equity issue, right? I mean, I feel like I'm at the family table, you know, and Uncle John,

25:59.040 --> 26:03.600
 you know, just showed up and, you know, and he hasn't gotten a first portion and they want to

26:03.600 --> 26:09.200
 know if I want to get, you know, thirds. And I actually, I have to say, I feel a bit embarrassed

26:10.000 --> 26:16.400
 about the global vaccination rollout and this whole concept that without, you know, data,

26:16.400 --> 26:20.400
 like, well, what benefit are we really getting, particularly when it rolls out of someone I like

26:20.400 --> 26:25.440
 to think of myself as young and healthy? Do I really need that third shot? I mean, if it's going

26:25.440 --> 26:30.800
 to go in the trash, if they're like, hey, Dr. Griffin, you know, we had a no show and we're not

26:30.800 --> 26:35.120
 sure what to do with this. Okay, that's that's a different scenario. But the idea that we're

26:35.120 --> 26:38.800
 going to keep buying hundreds of millions of vaccines that we're not going to somehow modify

26:38.800 --> 26:44.400
 our bureaucracy and share, you know, we're in a global pandemic. It's time for the bureaucracy to

26:44.400 --> 26:49.040
 add and people to be a little more reasonable. So can I ask you, Daniel, though, let's say we

26:49.040 --> 26:52.880
 did give a third dose. I presume within eight months, the levels of antibodies are going to

26:52.880 --> 26:56.720
 wane again. So are we going to give a dose every eight months? Is that the plan?

26:57.520 --> 27:01.920
 That sounds like the current plan. Sounds like where we're headed every eight, you know, maybe we'll

27:01.920 --> 27:07.600
 do it every six because who can keep track of every eight? But yeah, I don't understand the,

27:07.600 --> 27:12.640
 you know, and I, you know, to bounce back to Afghanistan. What's the end game? What are we doing?

27:12.640 --> 27:16.640
 Where are we going with this? Are we going to just keep every six months? And after a while,

27:16.640 --> 27:21.120
 you're going to have to start wondering what's the safety, you know, profile of we keep doing this

27:21.120 --> 27:26.240
 every every six months, every eight months, you know, with the influenza vaccine, it doesn't even

27:26.240 --> 27:30.880
 work well when you have to get everyone back every year for a new shot, right? It's the update is

27:30.880 --> 27:36.480
 very low. So I think it's a public health problem. Yeah. And from a public health problem, what is

27:36.480 --> 27:41.440
 fueling this pandemic? Not people failing to get a third shot is people failing to get the first

27:41.440 --> 27:46.640
 to exactly that. I think we should push to get people vaccinated, not to give those who are

27:46.640 --> 27:53.920
 already ever vaccinated a third shot. That's crazy. Oh, well, all right. So the period of

27:53.920 --> 27:58.800
 detectable viral replication, the viral symptom phase, right? This is that that first week for

27:58.800 --> 28:03.600
 most people. It's when people start to feel crummy. Maybe they had an exposure. What I like to say,

28:03.600 --> 28:09.120
 the time for monitoring and monoclonal is not the time for antibiotics. You know,

28:09.120 --> 28:15.040
 we've had a lot of enthusiasm about convalescent plasma. And the article early convalescent plasma

28:15.040 --> 28:19.920
 for high risk outpatients with COVID-19 was published this week in the New England Journal

28:19.920 --> 28:27.200
 of Medicine. This is the siren three CPO study. And there were 511 patients enrolled in the trial,

28:27.200 --> 28:35.040
 257 in the convalescent plasma group, 254 in the placebo group. The median age was 54.

28:35.040 --> 28:39.920
 The median symptom duration was four days, right? So they're doing it the right way.

28:40.720 --> 28:47.120
 The mean titer of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies was 1 to 641. So high titer

28:47.920 --> 28:53.840
 neutralizing antibodies given early. Disease progression occurred pretty much the same,

28:53.840 --> 28:59.360
 about 30% in people in the convalescent plasma group and in the placebo group. Now,

28:59.360 --> 29:05.760
 five patients in the convalescent plasma group died, only one in the placebo group.

29:06.640 --> 29:11.520
 Now comes regarding worst illness severity, hospital-free days, really similar in the two groups. So

29:12.320 --> 29:17.920
 just another study, early administration of high titer convalescent plasma for the treatment of

29:17.920 --> 29:25.600
 COVID-19 obtained from blood donors who recovered from the coronavirus disease 2019 was not helpful.

29:25.600 --> 29:32.400
 I sort of want to leave that there. I know there's a lot of enthusiasm. We've done a lot of the

29:32.400 --> 29:37.760
 science and the science does not support this intervention. Now, I am going to try to keep

29:37.760 --> 29:42.720
 this short today. We have a few emails. So I'm going to wrap up here just with really a couple

29:42.720 --> 29:48.320
 concluding thoughts. One is, as I continue to say, and we've bounced into this, no one is safe

29:48.320 --> 29:54.720
 until everyone is safe. We really need to figure out what's going on with the global vaccination

29:54.720 --> 30:00.720
 approach because it is falling flat. We are going to continue during the months of August,

30:00.720 --> 30:08.560
 September and October, to support floating doctors. We're hoping to give them a donation up to $40,000

30:08.560 --> 30:14.480
 to support their work down in Panama. We were able to get that support out to them, Rick,

30:14.480 --> 30:21.680
 and got a nice thank you photo from my friends in Uganda, where there is not a lot of vaccines,

30:21.680 --> 30:27.200
 where there is not a discussion of third doses. And so I want to thank all of our listeners for

30:27.200 --> 30:32.080
 continuing to support us, continuing to go to parasites without borders to donate, and to help

30:32.080 --> 30:38.480
 us with this work. Dan, you mentioned the Afghanistan situation. I assume nobody's getting vaccinated

30:38.480 --> 30:44.800
 there at these days, right? It is a problem. It's a problem. Yeah. People are concerned about

30:44.800 --> 30:50.320
 getting out, right? Yeah. I mean, it's really a humanitarian disaster we have right now,

30:50.320 --> 30:56.640
 and vaccinations are certainly not part of that. Yeah. Time for some email questions for Daniel.

30:56.640 --> 31:03.360
 You can send yours to Daniel at microbe.tv. We have one from Pear, who writes,

31:03.360 --> 31:08.800
 my daughter is a kidney transplant recipient, has recently been through lymphoma,

31:08.800 --> 31:15.120
 and barely has any B cells, thanks to retuximab. She's, however, on intravenous Ig therapy,

31:15.120 --> 31:19.440
 and I'm wondering, would that now confer some level of immunity against COVID? I found a few

31:19.440 --> 31:25.120
 papers commenting that there are common COVID antibodies in common IVIG, but I haven't been able

31:25.120 --> 31:30.880
 to find any information about if they confer any level of real life protection. I guess,

31:30.880 --> 31:36.000
 in an ideal world, she would be a recipient of monoclonal antibodies, but unfortunately,

31:36.000 --> 31:40.640
 we don't live in the US and they're not available where we live. Yeah. So just to give our listeners

31:40.640 --> 31:45.120
 maybe a little bit of background. So the whole concept here is this is an individual who cannot

31:45.120 --> 31:52.240
 make their own immunoglobulins or own antibodies. And so the IVIG treatments periodically, you're

31:52.240 --> 31:58.800
 giving this individual donated immunoglobulins from other individuals. Now, if those other

31:58.800 --> 32:03.600
 individuals perhaps have been vaccinated, and we're starting to see this now, that people who are

32:03.600 --> 32:10.640
 donating IVIG have been vaccinated, and in that IVIG are actually some of these protective antibodies

32:10.640 --> 32:16.320
 generated by vaccination or maybe prior infection. So that's helpful. I don't think we'll end up

32:16.320 --> 32:22.640
 doing like large scale studies, but a lot of the mechanism here just makes sense. The next thing

32:22.640 --> 32:29.280
 that would make the most sense is these are individuals who, if they were in the right setting,

32:29.280 --> 32:32.960
 could receive monoclonal antibodies. So that's being studied here in the US,

32:33.680 --> 32:39.040
 that's an expensive option, but IVIG is not cheap. But yeah, I think you're thinking this

32:39.040 --> 32:46.560
 through properly. Gene from London, by the way, discovered Twiv from your appearance on the Brian

32:46.560 --> 32:55.200
 Lear podcast, Daniel. So that's great. And she says, I never use the B word or the words viral load,

32:55.200 --> 33:01.040
 I distinguish infection from disease. So we're teaching them Daniel, that's great.

33:02.080 --> 33:07.200
 But we did make a mistake. And it's actually my fault. And several people have pointed this out.

33:07.200 --> 33:12.160
 I'd like to say it's carbon dioxide that we need to measure for indoor air quality

33:12.160 --> 33:18.080
 relating to COVID. And I had said carbon monoxide, of course, carbon monoxide would also be a serious

33:18.080 --> 33:23.440
 concern for air quality. I've implemented CO2 monitoring in my office as a proxy for

33:23.440 --> 33:28.720
 understanding ventilation levels. It's part of our layered mitigations, which include vaccination

33:28.720 --> 33:35.840
 masking hand and respiratory hygiene, reminding people to stay home if unwell. So that was my

33:35.840 --> 33:39.280
 mistake. Because you had said, what are those monitors? And I said carbon monoxide and a bunch

33:39.280 --> 33:44.240
 of people wrote in to say, no, no, no, it's carbon dioxide for that. Yeah, I don't know if you noticed

33:44.240 --> 33:48.240
 Vincent from there on out, I just kept referring them as the monitors and not correcting it.

33:48.240 --> 33:52.880
 Because you know, it's what you can correct me. It's no problem. Like how many people.

33:54.320 --> 34:01.760
 I like what our listeners write in. All right. And the last one is Thomas, who's up in Alberta,

34:01.760 --> 34:07.120
 Canada. I would like your thoughts on the anticoagulation issue you spoke about in the last

34:07.120 --> 34:11.200
 clinical update where the one arm of the paper in New England Journal for critically ill patients

34:11.200 --> 34:17.200
 showed no benefit with therapeutic anticoagulation. But the other arm, which wasn't highlighted in

34:17.200 --> 34:21.600
 the update of non critically ill patients, which would be a large proportion of hospitalized patients

34:21.600 --> 34:28.960
 did see benefit with therapeutic doses of LMWH. What is the standard of care for non critical

34:28.960 --> 34:34.000
 COVID-19 hospitalized patients in your community as it relates to anticoagulation?

34:34.880 --> 34:40.480
 Certainly. So the LMWH, that's low molecular weight heparid or anoxaparid is kind of the

34:40.480 --> 34:45.280
 common one that we use. You know, there's there's a balance here. If you do nothing,

34:46.000 --> 34:52.400
 people who have COVID-19 are at a higher risk of developing clotting complications,

34:52.400 --> 34:57.520
 both venous and arterial. And I said on the American Society of Hematology,

34:57.520 --> 35:02.640
 guidelines panel where we keep reviewing all the literature here. So I like to think that our

35:02.640 --> 35:08.960
 treatment is sort of up with the literature. And the baseline recommendation across across the bat

35:08.960 --> 35:16.880
 is anyone with COVID-19 who requires hospitalization and the associated immobility is put on prophylactic

35:16.880 --> 35:24.240
 dosing anticoagulation. If you escalate that, okay, maybe you're going to have a reduction in the

35:24.240 --> 35:28.960
 amount of clotting complications, but it is looking particularly as this study pointed out in critically

35:28.960 --> 35:33.360
 ill patients that you're going to increase your risk of major bleeding. Now what is major bleeding?

35:33.360 --> 35:39.440
 And that's tough. Is it a gastrointestinal bleed with about a 20 to 30% risk of death?

35:39.440 --> 35:45.280
 Is it an intracranial bleed with the associated neurological impact? Is it a retroperitoneal

35:45.280 --> 35:50.880
 bleed that we can transfuse through? So that that's really the balance here. So our standard

35:50.880 --> 35:57.440
 is everyone comes in prophylactic dosing anticoagulation, vigilance to make sure that they don't have a

35:57.440 --> 36:02.880
 clotting complication. And then sort of a case by case basis considering is there a reason to

36:02.880 --> 36:07.040
 escalate in this individual? Daniel, what's on your bow tie today? I can't quite see it.

36:08.000 --> 36:16.160
 So today is Clostridium difficile. Wow. So it's a gram negative. This is that antibiotic

36:16.160 --> 36:22.560
 associated diarrhea from people using using too many antibiotics. I'm very happy that both

36:22.560 --> 36:31.200
 ties represent all microbes. Try to be try to be an equal opportunity bow tie pathogen wearer.

36:31.200 --> 36:37.360
 That's COVID-19 clinical update number 76 with Dr. Daniel Griffin. Thank you, Daniel.

36:37.360 --> 36:46.960
 Oh, thank you. And everyone, including you Vincent, be safe.
