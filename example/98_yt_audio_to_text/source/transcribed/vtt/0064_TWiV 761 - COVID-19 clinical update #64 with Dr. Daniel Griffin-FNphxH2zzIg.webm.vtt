 This week in virology, the podcast about viruses, the kind that make you sick.

00:10.480 --> 00:21.440
 From MicroTV, this is Twiv, this week in virology. Episode 761 recorded on May 27, 2021.

00:21.440 --> 00:26.160
 I'm Vincent Rack and Yellow, and you're listening to the podcast all about viruses.

00:26.160 --> 00:32.000
 Joining me today from New York, Daniel Griffin. Hello, everyone.

00:33.280 --> 00:39.200
 Here we are, Daniel, in the midst of a pandemic, and people are arguing about whether the virus

00:39.200 --> 00:45.440
 came from a lab or not. Is this crazy? Well, you know what? You got it, like you got to watch

00:45.440 --> 00:52.000
 the subtleties, Vincent. You know, initially it was whether or not this was created in a lab.

00:52.000 --> 00:52.480
 That's right.

00:52.480 --> 00:55.760
 Now they're like, well, if it just had anything at all to do with the lab, we're going to take

00:55.760 --> 00:59.120
 that as a win. I don't get it. I really don't get it.

00:59.120 --> 01:05.360
 Yeah, well, yeah, I do, right. And I think, you know, everyone should listen to the most recent

01:05.360 --> 01:11.840
 Twiv, which I truly enjoyed, where Peter Dashnek and crew, you know, basically the actual

01:11.840 --> 01:17.680
 investigators who went there spoke for over an hour. And real, I thought that was a great

01:17.680 --> 01:23.920
 episode, because right, so many of these headlines are out there, and you find those secret stuff

01:23.920 --> 01:28.320
 we can't share with you. And then you find out the secret stuff is what we found out that during

01:28.320 --> 01:32.400
 the cold and flu season, there were a few people at a large institute that had respiratory symptoms.

01:34.640 --> 01:41.200
 Oh, my Lord, that confirms it. And by the way, you know, as Peter said, would you tell us who they

01:41.200 --> 01:44.720
 are? We could go see if that was due to COVID. We can't tell you who those three people were.

01:44.720 --> 01:49.120
 I mean, come on, it's, yeah, when you mix science and politics, what do you get Vincent?

01:49.760 --> 01:54.480
 Politics, I love that. I thought that was great. Yeah, that was a great line.

01:55.520 --> 01:59.680
 But of course, clinical, clinical medicine is immune from politics, right, Daniel?

02:00.400 --> 02:07.040
 Oh, you know, you know, the really tough thing is nothing is immune from politics. And it's,

02:07.040 --> 02:11.520
 it's all intermeshed. So sometimes it's really interesting when people say, oh, stay away from

02:11.520 --> 02:17.920
 politics. It's, it's hard in medicine, right? Because public health is always directly tied

02:17.920 --> 02:24.400
 in with politics. So, but all right, let's, let's try to avoid politics as much as we can. Okay.

02:25.920 --> 02:32.240
 So, actually, boy, and then of course, here's my quotation, never, ever depend on governments

02:32.240 --> 02:37.040
 or institutions to solve any major problems. All social change comes from the passion of

02:37.040 --> 02:43.680
 individuals. And that was Margaret Mead, her usual apolitical self. And I think she's actually

02:43.680 --> 02:47.920
 another one of those really tremendous individuals that my dad had the opportunity to get a chance

02:47.920 --> 02:53.920
 to meet and talk with. So, very jealous that he's, he had this opportunity. But all right,

02:53.920 --> 02:58.000
 let me let me give you a little bit of an update on what's going on here in New York. And what

02:58.000 --> 03:03.920
 I'm going to try to do is I'm going to intersperse some of the stories because I am still admitting

03:03.920 --> 03:12.800
 patients with COVID to the hospitals. But clearly, the numbers are lower. These individuals are,

03:12.800 --> 03:18.080
 as we're seeing across the country, they're the unvaccinated. That's who gets sick with COVID.

03:18.080 --> 03:22.160
 I mean, the vaccinations are incredibly powerful, right? We've quoted numbers,

03:23.120 --> 03:30.640
 Rich was trying to do the math. Your chance of dying of COVID after a vaccine is one in 500,000.

03:30.640 --> 03:36.320
 So, pretty, pretty tremendous. So, I will sort of say things are going in the right direction

03:36.320 --> 03:42.080
 here in New York in so many ways. But I'm going to throw little clinical vignettes, little stories,

03:42.080 --> 03:47.280
 little experiences that I'm having here that I think put this into context. So, I will start

03:47.280 --> 03:54.720
 off with children and COVID. And by the time this dropped, I'll have been on the air Friday morning,

03:54.720 --> 04:00.960
 channel 12, again, talking about a lot of the issues that have come up, a lot of the science,

04:00.960 --> 04:06.560
 and a lot of how this is being translated. So, this is kind of quickly changing. So,

04:07.120 --> 04:14.160
 May 19th, we had updated guidance here in New York State. And we had the executive order,

04:14.160 --> 04:19.600
 right? These are executive orders, which are law, new guidance for health and safety measures at

04:19.600 --> 04:25.440
 childcare, day camp, and overnight camp programs as New York proceeds with strategic reopening.

04:26.080 --> 04:30.960
 So, I want to put this into context, as I have done before, some sort of repeating here,

04:30.960 --> 04:38.480
 is the CDC gives us the science-based guidance. They try to interpret the science and translate

04:38.480 --> 04:43.680
 that into what might affect how we comport ourselves. But ultimately, at the state level,

04:43.680 --> 04:49.360
 our governors give us the rules that we have to live by. And I applaud all the clinicians

04:49.360 --> 04:53.760
 and other health care professionals that I know are donating their time to help guide everyone

04:53.760 --> 04:59.440
 through this. And fortunately, I'm finding as someone that gives advice to a lot of these places,

05:00.400 --> 05:05.440
 that the staff is getting really savvy. They're really starting to get the science. I mean,

05:05.440 --> 05:10.480
 they've been educated up, which is fantastic. There's also a lot of different associations that

05:11.440 --> 05:16.640
 camps and restaurants and all these childcare facilities rely on. And those associations

05:16.640 --> 05:20.240
 really have tremendous people that are taking the time and getting up on the science. So,

05:20.960 --> 05:25.120
 with that said, what was that guidance? I'm going to tell you ahead of time,

05:25.120 --> 05:28.640
 we got more guidance on the 24th, so that's going to get layered onto this. So,

05:28.640 --> 05:36.560
 what was the initial guidance on the 19th? Facilities and programs must collect COVID-19

05:36.560 --> 05:43.120
 vaccination status and documentation for all staff and children. So, that's actually kind of

05:43.120 --> 05:49.040
 heavy, right? That's a little bit of a thing. We've talked about, you know, HIPAA's coming up

05:49.040 --> 05:54.800
 periodically. But what is really the issue here? An employer, a person running with these programs

05:54.800 --> 06:00.000
 can ask, you know, the HIPAA thing would be a person may say I'd rather not answer that question,

06:00.000 --> 06:04.400
 but this is an interesting challenge. They're actually saying you must collect the vaccination

06:04.400 --> 06:11.120
 status. So, that's going to be an interesting challenge into this summer. The next mandatory

06:11.120 --> 06:17.440
 daily health screening practices of staff and visitors, including daily temperature checks.

06:18.320 --> 06:21.920
 And that is a little bit of an issue. And we've discussed this at sort of a national level,

06:21.920 --> 06:27.840
 is how much do those actually help? And then particularly those daily temperature checks,

06:27.840 --> 06:34.560
 because we've got to start thinking of COVID as the flu. A lot of individuals, particularly during

06:34.560 --> 06:38.560
 those first few days when they're shedding a lot, they do not have fevers, right? So,

06:38.560 --> 06:43.600
 there's a little bit of an issue here, but that's your state, right? This will be different

06:43.600 --> 06:49.200
 everyone else's state and country. Facility and programs need to notify the state and local

06:49.200 --> 06:56.320
 health department immediately upon being informed of any positive COVID-19 test by a staff member

06:56.320 --> 07:03.760
 or child at their site. Each site must implement a property specific capacity limitation

07:03.760 --> 07:12.960
 for children and campers that ensures appropriate social distancing. Staff who are not fully

07:12.960 --> 07:19.440
 vaccinated must maintain a distance of at least six feet from other unvaccinated staff, right? So,

07:19.440 --> 07:23.760
 that sort of requires you to know, unless you're going to make everyone distance,

07:24.400 --> 07:29.840
 children and campers over the age of two and staff who are not fully vaccinated must wear

07:29.840 --> 07:34.880
 face coverings, except when eating, drinking, showering, swimming, or sleeping, resting.

07:34.880 --> 07:40.880
 Take a deep breath. And now, May 24th, we get an update and it hits right on some of these issues.

07:41.520 --> 07:48.480
 Suddenly, it has changed. And I say suddenly, not to be judgmental, but the guidance is moving

07:48.480 --> 07:55.200
 forward. Responsible parties should encourage children, campers aged to an older who are not fully

07:55.200 --> 08:01.280
 vaccinated to wear face covering. Young children campers, those that are not in kindergarten,

08:01.280 --> 08:07.280
 do not need to wear face coverings when they're in a child's care or a day camp program facility

08:07.280 --> 08:12.720
 or area, right? So, it's getting a little bit different here. Children campers are not required

08:12.720 --> 08:19.280
 to wear a face covering when utilizing the outdoor space that belongs to and or is exclusively

08:19.280 --> 08:26.960
 used by the child care or a day camp program and then restricting saying face coverings must be

08:26.960 --> 08:32.480
 worn by individuals who are not fully vaccinated during transportation, right? So, they're actually,

08:32.480 --> 08:37.520
 at least here in New York State, if you read this guidance closely, it's not that easy to read that

08:37.520 --> 08:44.240
 closely. But if the kids are there, if they're in that camp setting, in that child care setting,

08:44.240 --> 08:50.880
 they do not necessarily need to have mass on when they're outdoors. And I think this evolves

08:50.880 --> 08:57.520
 from some of the science we have talked about. Outdoors is a very safe place relative to other

08:57.520 --> 09:05.440
 places. A proper translation of the research, I think, is that transmission is less than 1% in

09:05.440 --> 09:11.920
 the outdoor area. So, outdoors in the summer, dropping prevalence, particularly here in New

09:11.920 --> 09:17.520
 York State, these are all going to be really positive for our kids. I don't go that much into,

09:17.520 --> 09:22.160
 I did go into a little in previous ones, but there is a mental health and all kinds of other

09:22.160 --> 09:26.880
 challenges to having kids wear masks, having all these restrictions that our kids have

09:26.880 --> 09:33.680
 gone through. And I always get angry emails when I talk about the fact that we have learned a lot

09:33.680 --> 09:40.160
 about how we can actually get kids in these different settings, in camp, in school,

09:40.160 --> 09:46.240
 how we can do it safely. Maybe sometimes the rates of infection are even lower when kids are allowed

09:46.240 --> 09:52.480
 to go to school with the proper mitigation methods. Well, let's talk about that. There was a recent

09:52.480 --> 09:58.720
 preprint that got a lot of headlines. So, let's go through this because I think it was misinterpreted

09:58.720 --> 10:03.920
 a little bit. So, I want to actually go through what it actually said if one takes the time. So,

10:03.920 --> 10:12.640
 this was the preprint COVID-19 mitigation practices and COVID-19 rates in schools report on data from

10:12.640 --> 10:20.320
 Florida, New York, and Massachusetts. So, this was recently posted and the authors used data

10:20.320 --> 10:27.360
 from the COVID-19 school response dashboard. Now, what is that? Now, this is a resource created

10:27.360 --> 10:34.080
 with the organizing partners, the AASA, the school superintendents Association, the National Association

10:34.080 --> 10:38.320
 of Secondary School Principles, the National Association of Elementary School Principles,

10:38.320 --> 10:43.600
 Brown University Professor of Economics, Emily Oster. And this can actually be accessed. This is

10:44.400 --> 10:50.000
 COVIDschool-board.com. You can go there and look at the data. But as the authors point out,

10:50.720 --> 10:55.040
 they only looked at data from Florida, New York, and Massachusetts because

10:55.040 --> 11:01.280
 as they in the COVID school dashboard report, this resource only contains consistent data for a

11:01.280 --> 11:06.080
 limited number of states. There's actually a couple more that the COVID school dashboard has added.

11:06.960 --> 11:13.520
 I will say that this paper will be much better after peer review. Despite several limitations,

11:13.520 --> 11:20.400
 the authors point out what I agree, basically finding that there does seem to be a lower rate

11:20.400 --> 11:27.840
 of COVID-19 for students being in school, suggesting that actually kids may be safer in school and

11:27.840 --> 11:33.360
 then not in school. And this has been sort of an interesting touchy for when I discuss this with

11:33.360 --> 11:39.520
 parent groups. You know, who would I trust with my children? Let's say the Port Washington School

11:39.520 --> 11:45.440
 District or my wife, it would be my wife. But there is a dynamic that happens socially when our

11:45.440 --> 11:49.600
 kids are isolated. We're trying to figure out ways for them to socially interact. And it is,

11:49.600 --> 11:54.000
 it is hard and the school can can do it in such a way with actually get a degree of social

11:54.000 --> 11:58.160
 interaction. Now, one of the things that was taken away from this, I will point out,

11:58.960 --> 12:05.680
 is people said this study failed to show an impact of masking. So they only actually had

12:05.680 --> 12:10.720
 mask mandate information for Florida. And I'll qualify that all they had was whether or not there

12:10.720 --> 12:15.360
 was a mandate in place. There was no on the ground checking to see whether masks were being worn,

12:15.360 --> 12:21.280
 not worn. There did seem to be a little bit of a signal to the teachers wearing masks.

12:22.160 --> 12:26.000
 But I'm going to sort of leave it at that point, because we're going to hit some other, I think,

12:26.000 --> 12:30.560
 data where we actually look at when they looked at masks ventilation, where they've actually shown

12:30.560 --> 12:36.000
 that that is associated with a reduction in transmission. Pre-exposure transmission period,

12:36.000 --> 12:46.320
 I really liked another early release that came out in the MMWR. And this was sort of shadowing this

12:46.320 --> 12:52.400
 mask use and ventilation improvements to reduce COVID-19 incidents in elementary schools. And this

12:52.400 --> 13:01.440
 was Georgia November 16 to December 11. Now, the authors reported that COVID-19 incidents was 37%

13:01.440 --> 13:09.440
 lower in schools that required teachers and staff members to use masks and 39% lower in schools

13:09.440 --> 13:15.040
 that improved ventilation. And the ventilation strategies associated with lower school incidents

13:15.040 --> 13:23.520
 included dilution methods alone. That was 35% lower incidence. Or in combination with filtration

13:23.520 --> 13:29.520
 methods, that was a 48% lower incidence. So using things like those HEPA filtration systems. So

13:29.520 --> 13:35.440
 in this study, the authors used data from the Georgia kindergarten through grade five K through

13:35.440 --> 13:42.880
 five schools that opened for in-person learning during fall 2020. And they reported on huge study

13:42.880 --> 13:50.240
 169 K through five schools that participated in a survey on prevention strategies and recorded

13:50.240 --> 13:58.240
 COVID-19 cases during November 16 to December 11, 2020. And so the Georgia Department of Public

13:58.240 --> 14:04.240
 Health required all Georgia schools to submit weekly data on the aggregate number of COVID-19

14:04.240 --> 14:11.680
 cases among students and staff members. And this analysis was based on 1,321 public K through five

14:11.680 --> 14:17.920
 schools, 140 private K through five schools. And prevention strategies assessed included mask

14:17.920 --> 14:24.720
 requirements for teachers, staff members, students, ventilation improvements, physical distancing of

14:24.720 --> 14:30.480
 desks greater than six feet apart. Barriers on student desks, class size, number of students

14:30.480 --> 14:35.680
 in a classroom, cohort size of small groups of students who stay together throughout the day

14:35.680 --> 14:41.280
 during in-person learning, and number and locations of available hand washing stations.

14:42.320 --> 14:47.280
 And I know the paper focused on masks and ventilation as far as their conclusions.

14:47.280 --> 14:50.880
 But there's really interesting information if you go through the paper in detail,

14:50.880 --> 14:55.920
 look at the tables. And in addition to sort of the conclusions, I point out a couple of things

14:55.920 --> 15:02.640
 that I found interesting. The higher the county COVID-19 incidents, the higher the number of

15:02.640 --> 15:08.480
 students that tested positive. So I think that's again what we've seen the community incidents

15:09.040 --> 15:14.480
 actually ties in very directly with school incidents. And they also didn't really see an

15:14.480 --> 15:19.680
 impact of that separating the desk by six feet. Basically the schools that did it and those that

15:19.680 --> 15:25.680
 did not had the same incidents of COVID-19 per 500 students. So again, we've talked a little bit

15:25.680 --> 15:29.360
 about do you need six feet? Can you get them three feet? Is that getting what you need?

15:30.000 --> 15:36.480
 And we're seeing masks, three feet ventilation improvements, all these other testing, all these

15:36.480 --> 15:41.520
 other strategies really are showing us that schools could be a really safe place even for

15:41.520 --> 15:47.520
 unvaccinated children. And now that we're vaccinating adolescents, now that our rates are dropping,

15:47.520 --> 15:52.800
 I think the sciences is supporting a lot of our progress in this area with getting kids

15:53.360 --> 15:59.120
 back to schools, back to social interactions and camps. All right, testing never miss an

15:59.120 --> 16:03.760
 opportunity to test. You know, I'm beginning to think that everyone should just subscribe to

16:03.760 --> 16:09.440
 the CDC morbidity and mortality weekly reports. And I will say I also listened to there. They

16:09.440 --> 16:14.880
 have a great weekly podcast if you don't like to read. You could do both. I do both. But there

16:14.880 --> 16:22.400
 was another release in the MMWR. This one was entitled COVID-19 testing to sustain in-person

16:22.400 --> 16:28.880
 instruction and extracurricular activities in high schools, Utah, November 2020 to March 2021.

16:29.760 --> 16:35.280
 Now, for context, COVID-19 was associated with the cessation of kindergarten through grade 12

16:35.280 --> 16:40.640
 in-person instruction and extracurricular activities. So most of us can agree that this

16:40.640 --> 16:45.920
 had negative social, emotional, and educational consequences for our children. So what were they

16:45.920 --> 16:53.040
 doing here? The authors reported on two high school COVID-19 testing programs that were created to

16:53.040 --> 16:59.920
 sustain in-person instruction and allow for extracurricular activities. During November 30, 2020,

16:59.920 --> 17:11.040
 through March 2021, among 59,552 students who received testing 3.2% had a positive result.

17:11.680 --> 17:15.840
 So what they went through doing these programs, these programs that they put in place

17:15.840 --> 17:22.080
 facilitated the completion of approximately 95% of the high school extracurricular competition

17:22.080 --> 17:30.640
 events and saved an estimated 109,752 in-person instruction student days. So the authors were

17:30.640 --> 17:35.840
 suggesting that school-based COVID-19 testing should be considered part of a comprehensive

17:35.840 --> 17:41.600
 prevention strategy to identify SARS-CoV-2 infections in schools and sustain in-person

17:41.600 --> 17:47.360
 instruction and extracurricular activities. So what did they actually do? Well, the schools

17:47.360 --> 17:54.480
 implemented these two high school testing programs. Test to play and test to stay. So I love how

17:54.480 --> 18:02.240
 catchy these are. So test to play. This was where there was testing every 14 days mandated for

18:02.240 --> 18:08.560
 participation in extracurricular activities. That doesn't seem very often, right, every 14 days.

18:08.560 --> 18:16.000
 Test to stay involved school-wide testing to continue in-person instruction as an alternative

18:16.000 --> 18:21.600
 to transitioning to remote instruction if a school crossed a defined outbreak threshold,

18:21.600 --> 18:26.080
 right? So these are areas where we're starting to see increased incidence. They're jumping in

18:26.080 --> 18:34.000
 with these testing strategies during November 30, 2020 through March 20, 2021. As I mentioned,

18:34.000 --> 18:41.440
 59,552 students were tested through these programs at over 100 of Utah's public schools.

18:41.440 --> 18:48.640
 They implemented rapid antigen testing. Now with rising rates of COVID-19 in Utah,

18:48.640 --> 18:55.440
 a November 9 statewide COVID-19 restrictions were ordered, and part of that was a cessation of

18:55.440 --> 19:02.080
 extracurricular activities. That was when test to play was introduced. And in December 2020,

19:02.080 --> 19:09.680
 test to stay was piloted at two high schools. And beginning January 4, 2021, schools crossing the

19:09.680 --> 19:16.160
 outbake threshold could choose to implement test to stay as an alternative to transitioning to

19:16.160 --> 19:20.320
 remote instruction. And a number of the schools jumped in. They took advantage of this. They

19:20.320 --> 19:27.600
 were given free test kits, training, testing assistance, help implementing these programs,

19:28.320 --> 19:34.400
 and the authors point out with their conclusions that this approach can serve as a framework for

19:34.400 --> 19:41.360
 other schools wanting to have kids back in school for sustained in-person instruction

19:41.360 --> 19:47.520
 and continued extracurricular activities. Active vaccination. Never miss an opportunity

19:47.520 --> 19:53.680
 to vaccinate. And I also say vaccines are how this pandemic ends. And I'm going to start here

19:53.680 --> 19:58.880
 with with the story. I actually every so often get upset. I may seem calm and level headed all

19:58.880 --> 20:04.880
 times because sometimes things get me a little bit upset. And this was a patient of mine taking

20:04.880 --> 20:10.480
 care of her several times in the past. I've known her for a while. She is homebound. So she was

20:10.480 --> 20:17.200
 homebound. And she was very excited to get vaccinated. But her primary care physician was

20:17.200 --> 20:22.640
 not aware of how to access one of these programs to get a homebound person vaccinated.

20:22.640 --> 20:29.280
 And this frustrates me because I will say a lot of people are jumping into this space and trying

20:29.280 --> 20:34.000
 to help actually north well. One of our large healthcare systems here is actually set up a

20:34.000 --> 20:40.000
 program where physicians can reach out, connect their patient, and personnel will go out to the

20:40.000 --> 20:46.400
 residents and vaccinate these homebound people in their home. So these exist. These programs

20:46.400 --> 20:50.720
 exist. So if you are taking care of patients, if you have someone you care about who's homebound,

20:50.720 --> 20:55.760
 who can't get to a vaccine site, start making those calls. Let's let's get these people vaccinated.

20:55.760 --> 21:01.760
 But so while she's waiting, unable to get vaccinated, she is homebound. And she is being taken care of

21:01.760 --> 21:08.960
 by a home health aide who happens to be an anti-vaxxer. The home healthcare aid gets COVID. The home

21:08.960 --> 21:16.720
 healthcare aid infects our patient, my patient. And now my patient who is unvaccinated is in the

21:16.720 --> 21:24.400
 hospital on steroids, on remdesivir, on anticoagulation, on oxygen. And just this very much could be

21:24.400 --> 21:29.600
 avoided. The other thing that didn't happen there is after she was exposed, started to get sick,

21:30.400 --> 21:35.760
 monoclonals were not given. And I think I pointed out too, monoclonals, we have programs for

21:35.760 --> 21:40.960
 delivering those in the home for homebound individuals as well. So she missed her opportunity to get

21:40.960 --> 21:46.240
 vaccinated. She missed her opportunity to get monoclonals. And you know, it's upsetting to me.

21:46.240 --> 21:49.680
 I understand that people want to make decisions. But when you make a decision,

21:49.680 --> 21:54.320
 that ends up putting someone else in the hospital that I find very difficult.

21:54.320 --> 22:00.320
 On May 25th, we heard from Moderna with the press release. Moderna announces teen COVE

22:00.320 --> 22:06.800
 study of its COVID-19 vaccine in adolescence meets primary endpoint. And they plan to submit data

22:06.800 --> 22:15.200
 to regulators in early June to expand the EUA down to 12 years of age for Moderna. Now,

22:15.200 --> 22:23.120
 this was a phase two, three study in 3,732 adolescent participants aged 12 to less than 18.

22:24.160 --> 22:30.480
 And they were randomized two to one to 200 microgram doses of the mRNA 1273,

22:30.480 --> 22:37.600
 so the Moderna vaccine or placebo. And the primary endpoint was non-inferior immunogenicity versus

22:37.600 --> 22:44.880
 the phase three adult study comparator that was met after two doses. No cases of COVID-19 were

22:44.880 --> 22:50.560
 observed in the vaccine group using the case definition from the adult phase three COVE study.

22:51.120 --> 22:56.720
 Compared to four cases in the placebo group, resulting in a vaccine efficacy of 100% starting

22:56.720 --> 23:02.480
 14 days after the second dose. Keep in mind those numbers, right? So you want to hang your hat on

23:02.480 --> 23:08.960
 that. Because the incidence rate of COVID-19 is lower in adolescence, a secondary case definition

23:08.960 --> 23:15.840
 based on CDC definition of COVID-19 was also evaluated to include cases presenting with milder

23:15.840 --> 23:23.760
 symptoms. So using the CDC definition, which requires only one symptom and a nasopharyngeal

23:23.760 --> 23:30.960
 swab or saliva sample positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR, we got a vaccine efficacy of 93%

23:30.960 --> 23:40.800
 after the first dose. The Moderna vaccine was well tolerated with really the same safety profile

23:40.800 --> 23:45.280
 that we saw in adults. That was really positive, kind of nice. We're going to have some more options

23:45.280 --> 23:51.200
 eventually. The FDA also, this is, this actually is pretty big. They authorized a longer time for

23:51.200 --> 23:59.440
 refrigerator storage of the THOD Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine prior to dilution. So if people

23:59.440 --> 24:05.760
 have ever worked with this, these come in a non-deluded vial and then you have a little normal

24:05.760 --> 24:10.880
 saline that you use to dilute that before you administer it. You can take that out of the deep

24:10.880 --> 24:17.600
 freeze thermal shippers. You can leave it in a normal refrigerator for up to a month. I don't

24:17.600 --> 24:24.480
 know if that's 30 or 31 days or 28 if it's February, but no, it's 30 days in a normal medical refrigerator.

24:24.480 --> 24:30.400
 And there's now an updated fact sheet with this modification. One still needs to get that into

24:30.400 --> 24:35.600
 arms within six hours after you dilute that. So that is a little different than Moderna. Once

24:35.600 --> 24:42.800
 you puncture a Moderna vial, you've got 12 hours. The other thing in here is that normally you had

24:42.800 --> 24:49.120
 to order over 1,000 of the Pfizer BioNTech vaccines and this big thermal shipper. You can order

24:49.120 --> 24:54.720
 half thermal shippers, so about 600 or so. And also we have programs I think I mentioned here in

24:54.720 --> 25:00.800
 New York where you can actually partner with other organizations and get as little as 40 or 50

25:00.800 --> 25:05.360
 doses where someone else is taking another 40 or 50 doses and a number of practices are working

25:05.360 --> 25:10.400
 together so that we can start offering this in the pediatrician's office in more of the primary

25:10.400 --> 25:17.760
 care setting offices. So this is really huge for helping us improve access. The period of

25:17.760 --> 25:23.840
 detectable viral replication or the viral symptom phase, as I like to say, the time for monitoring

25:23.840 --> 25:30.320
 and monoclonals and NSAIDs are fine for symptomatic relief. I'm going to tell another story here and

25:30.320 --> 25:35.520
 this was kind of an interesting story. I see a lot of individuals who are suffering from long

25:35.520 --> 25:42.080
 COVID and this person was actually interesting. I don't see a lot of this, but this was an individual

25:42.080 --> 25:49.120
 who got sick in early January. This was an older man, late 70s, a number of health problems.

25:49.840 --> 25:55.120
 And he actually got monoclonals, maybe a little bit late, about day eight, but he actually went on

25:55.120 --> 26:02.400
 to develop long COVID. And so I first saw this gentleman about seven weeks ago. And at that

26:02.400 --> 26:07.360
 point in time, we talked and I usually tell people, hey, why don't we go ahead and let's try

26:07.360 --> 26:12.400
 see if vaccination will have any impact here. It was really, I have to say, this was very pleasant

26:12.400 --> 26:17.120
 Tuesday in the afternoon in the office, because this gentleman got on and just basically said,

26:17.120 --> 26:22.720
 Dr. Griffin, it was like switching in the lights. I am completely better. I have no more symptoms.

26:22.720 --> 26:27.280
 Thank you. We don't need to see each other anymore. So sort of two issues there. One was actually,

26:27.280 --> 26:33.840
 I do not often see people with long COVID after monoclonals. I have actually seen several just

26:33.840 --> 26:39.440
 to and we're analyzing our data to see what the incidence is or if there is an impact on long

26:39.440 --> 26:44.960
 COVID to getting monoclonals. So we'll have that data, hopefully, to share real data, not just this

26:44.960 --> 26:52.560
 story, but also, again, really nice to see another individual who had this really nice timing of

26:52.560 --> 26:58.480
 recovery after vaccination. All right, another monoclonal option just got EUA this week, right?

26:58.480 --> 27:07.520
 So more options here. GSK and VIR Biotech announced Sotra VIMAB. So this is VIR7831.

27:07.520 --> 27:13.920
 I'm not sure their name is easier to say than VIR7831, but Sotra VIMAB received EUA

27:15.040 --> 27:19.520
 for treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in high-risk adults and pediatric patients.

27:20.080 --> 27:24.240
 This is actually based on data that we've discussed before. This was the common trial data

27:24.240 --> 27:30.720
 with an 85% reduction in risk of hospitalization or death. And I actually want to point out,

27:30.720 --> 27:38.080
 and this is in the EUA in the announcement, is that Sotra VIMAB maintains activity against all

27:38.080 --> 27:45.760
 known variants of concern, including that triple mutant variant from India. So that is nice to say.

27:45.760 --> 27:51.280
 Monoclonal access is actually now expanded, and the wording now is,

27:51.280 --> 27:56.480
 healthcare providers can now consider the benefit risk for an individual patient

27:56.480 --> 28:01.520
 using the fact sheet for healthcare providers and the CDC website as guidance. So now we're

28:01.520 --> 28:06.080
 saying you can look at giving this to your high-risk patients. You don't necessarily have to check

28:06.080 --> 28:11.920
 that box. We talked about BMI of 25. So maybe it's a BMI of 24. You're going to use your

28:11.920 --> 28:18.320
 judgment there. Maybe they're not 65, but they're 63. Is that close enough? So we're seeing a little

28:18.320 --> 28:23.280
 bit of realization that there's no reason to let these products sit on the shelf, considering

28:23.280 --> 28:28.400
 how incredibly effective they can be and how safe they have been. But remember, the monoclonal

28:28.400 --> 28:35.280
 cocktails are not authorized for and probably are not a benefit for people who have missed the window

28:35.280 --> 28:40.160
 and are already hospitalized due to COVID-19, who require oxygen therapy, because they've gotten

28:40.160 --> 28:45.280
 into that early inflammatory phase, or who have chronic oxygen needs and now have an increased

28:45.280 --> 28:51.600
 requirement. And, you know, and this is in, is that monoclonals actually may be associated with

28:51.600 --> 28:56.320
 worse clinical outcomes when administered to hospitalized patients with COVID-19 requiring

28:56.320 --> 29:02.240
 high-flow oxygen or mechanical ventilation. So we go from a window of opportunity to a time

29:02.240 --> 29:06.480
 when that is closed, actually a time when we may be harming our patients by using these. So

29:07.120 --> 29:12.000
 this isn't something that you want to just ban for your relative. You need an educated clinician

29:12.000 --> 29:16.640
 helping make the decision about whether or not this is going to be a life-saving, a beneficial,

29:16.640 --> 29:21.120
 or even an harmful intervention. One of the management decisions that I often struggle

29:21.120 --> 29:25.760
 with during this time, and I'm still going to say after this, I still struggle with this,

29:25.760 --> 29:32.000
 is, is there a role for aspirin in the outpatient setting? And there was an article,

29:32.000 --> 29:38.640
 active prescription of low dose aspirin during or prior to hospitalization and mortality in COVID-19,

29:38.640 --> 29:45.440
 a systematic review and meta-analysis of adjusted effect estimates. And this was published in the

29:45.440 --> 29:50.240
 International Journal of Infectious Diseases. And I actually spent a lot of time analyzing this

29:50.240 --> 29:55.040
 paper to really see if I could come away with a conclusion. So this was a meta-analysis,

29:55.760 --> 30:00.560
 which our listeners may recall is what you, when you get, you take a whole bunch of studies and

30:00.560 --> 30:04.880
 you stack them on one on top of another and maybe each study isn't so great. But when you get them

30:04.880 --> 30:10.080
 all together, you reach a certain height and they miraculously turn into gold. That is not the case.

30:10.800 --> 30:18.960
 The authors report too have found six eligible studies comprising 13,993 patients, right? So that,

30:18.960 --> 30:23.680
 that's not an impressive. That's, oh, this is great. But let's be fair. When you actually start

30:23.680 --> 30:30.560
 reading the article, you realize that 12,600 of those patients come from just one study. And then

30:30.560 --> 30:38.320
 the other studies all have only between 48 and 638 patients, really making this a sort of a

30:38.320 --> 30:44.960
 re-analysis of that huge study. And what was that huge study with the 12,600? That was

30:44.960 --> 30:50.320
 association of mortality and aspirin prescriptions for COVID-19 patients at the Veterans Health

30:50.320 --> 30:56.320
 Administration that was published back in February. And if you look at that, what did they do? They

30:56.320 --> 31:01.280
 did not actually look in that study at people getting aspirin for the treatment of COVID.

31:01.280 --> 31:07.280
 They just looked at veterans in a database and said, who was on aspirin prior to getting COVID?

31:08.400 --> 31:13.120
 And then they looked at their outcomes versus the outcomes of those people who were not prescribed

31:13.120 --> 31:18.960
 aspirin. So I'm really left without any certainty regarding a benefit or even harm with routine use

31:18.960 --> 31:24.320
 of aspirin. So I'm going to leave this in sort of the clinical judgment realm. No real good science

31:24.320 --> 31:29.120
 helping us. And we do. We need good science helping us with aspirin and a platelet agents

31:29.120 --> 31:33.520
 and a coagulation. All right. So now we're going to get to the tail. We're going to jump way ahead

31:33.520 --> 31:37.280
 here to the tail. I don't feel like I have any other new things to jump in on some of these other

31:37.280 --> 31:45.440
 areas. But we have information out of the UK on children and COVID. And I think this is important

31:45.440 --> 31:51.680
 to sort of get things in context. So one of the things we now think we have a sense is the case,

31:51.680 --> 31:58.320
 or I'll say the infection hospitalization rate for children. We don't really know the case or

31:58.320 --> 32:02.960
 the actual infection. We have the cases. But let's look at this study. So illustration and

32:02.960 --> 32:10.800
 symptom profile in a large cohort of symptomatic UK school aged children tested for SARS-CoV-2.

32:10.800 --> 32:16.240
 This was posted in a preprint. So it hasn't gone through peer review yet. And the authors here

32:16.240 --> 32:24.240
 reported on 1,734 children with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result. And they had information on

32:24.240 --> 32:28.320
 illness duration within the study timeframe. Right? Because they wanted to be able to ask the

32:28.320 --> 32:34.320
 question of these kids who get COVID, how long are they sick? We got a little bit of information

32:34.320 --> 32:41.680
 on symptoms. The most common symptom was headache. That was 62.2%. Fatigue was a little over half,

32:41.680 --> 32:49.360
 55%. And the median acute illness duration was six days. But that was a little bit different.

32:49.360 --> 32:53.920
 Seven days if you were older, five days if you were younger, as far as symptom duration. So

32:53.920 --> 32:57.920
 here, what are we looking at? We're looking at what kids went on to have prolonged symptoms.

32:58.560 --> 33:04.240
 4.4% of the children had an illness duration of greater than 28 days.

33:05.760 --> 33:10.320
 More commonly experienced by the older versus the younger children. So if you looked at the

33:10.320 --> 33:17.200
 older, it was actually about 5.1%. And the younger about 3.1%. So sort of a trend there.

33:17.200 --> 33:22.720
 The common symptoms experienced by these children for this prolonged period of time past 28 days

33:22.720 --> 33:29.760
 was 84%. 80% of them were reporting headaches. 80% of them were reporting a lack of ability to

33:29.760 --> 33:38.480
 smell. When we got out to greater than 56 days, 1.8% of the children were still experiencing symptoms.

33:38.480 --> 33:44.000
 So I'm going to avoid using words like only or just. But this gives us a sense of the risk here.

33:45.040 --> 33:53.120
 Kids got COVID. About 4.4% of them were still having symptoms about a month out. Once we got

33:53.120 --> 34:00.880
 to about two months out, 1.8% of the kids had continued symptoms. So this is suggesting that

34:00.880 --> 34:09.040
 the incidence of long COVID or post cutes quality of COVID is lower in children than adults. The

34:09.040 --> 34:13.840
 symptom burden in these children didn't increase. They did not get worse. And as we saw as we went

34:13.840 --> 34:19.520
 from 30 days to 60 days, we actually had a lower percentage of kids continuing to report

34:20.240 --> 34:23.920
 any symptoms there. I'm going to finish with one. Actually, this was sort of a hot off the

34:23.920 --> 34:27.920
 press story that I thought was interesting. And I'll just leave this for people to speculate on.

34:27.920 --> 34:35.600
 I have a patient still taking care of her in the hospital. And she got sick back in December.

34:36.240 --> 34:42.800
 And she has a number of autoimmune diseases. She's on some immunosuppressive medicine. It had been

34:42.800 --> 34:49.680
 quite a period of time. And about a month ago, we decided to repeat her PCR this time quantitatively,

34:49.680 --> 34:54.160
 right? Because we've been positive PCR forever. And we really been looking at the literature. And

34:54.160 --> 34:59.920
 a lot of the suggestions, boy, once you get past about 10, maybe 20 days, you have a positive PCR,

34:59.920 --> 35:06.560
 but it's really just low level. And in this individual, the PCR came back in the 20s, actually

35:06.560 --> 35:14.720
 translating into about 45 million RNA copies, quite surprised at how high this was. We discussed

35:14.720 --> 35:19.680
 with her and her sons that we really had no evidence-based interventions to offer them.

35:19.680 --> 35:24.480
 And we then moved on to a discussion of what are we going to do in the future so that this

35:24.480 --> 35:29.040
 woman doesn't get reinfected, right? Not clear that she's mounting any great response.

35:30.080 --> 35:35.600
 And so they were concerned about vaccination. She had had some prior issues with vaccination.

35:35.600 --> 35:41.600
 And we decided, as a joint shared decision-making, that the safest place to go ahead with vaccination

35:41.600 --> 35:47.760
 was while she was still in the hospital before she was discharged. She received the J and J vaccine,

35:47.760 --> 35:54.320
 which really tolerated without any event. And today was about 10 days after that dose.

35:55.280 --> 36:01.280
 And we've been trying to look at our options for sending this woman to different facilities.

36:01.280 --> 36:07.200
 And we repeated the PCR today, and it was negative. Very exciting. We're going to repeat it again

36:07.200 --> 36:13.200
 tomorrow. So sort of interesting. One of those observations, is it true that that's related

36:13.200 --> 36:17.920
 to the vaccine? Do we just finally get to that threshold? But for me, very encouraging. After

36:17.920 --> 36:23.120
 this very long odyssey, this woman is potentially going to leave the hospital vaccinated.

36:23.120 --> 36:27.120
 I will leave it there and just remind everyone, drop what you're doing if you love what we do.

36:28.000 --> 36:33.280
 Or if you love what FIMRIC does, we are still continuing to help support Foundation International

36:33.280 --> 36:37.760
 Medical Relief of Children. And this is really a tremendous organization that I've worked with

36:37.760 --> 36:43.440
 for years with sites throughout the world, really making a difference in so many people's lives.

36:43.440 --> 36:47.520
 And really the mission that I love, they go to these places, they ask the people there,

36:47.520 --> 36:52.320
 what do you need? What can we do to help you? And then they work with those communities to try to

36:52.320 --> 36:57.280
 meet those needs. So go to parasites without borders.com and help us support them and continue our work.

36:57.920 --> 37:05.120
 Time for some emails for Daniel. If you want to send one in, Daniel at microbe.tv. Bill writes,

37:05.120 --> 37:11.200
 my 13 year old son just received Gardasil vaccine. And with the approval for COVID for kids,

37:11.200 --> 37:16.720
 we'd like to get him vaccinated ASAP. Is there a waiting period we should adhere to between different

37:16.720 --> 37:24.000
 viral vaccinations? So that has been that two week waiting period has been removed.

37:24.000 --> 37:28.560
 Early on, I always said, don't ever let that stand in the way. Try to sort of space things

37:28.560 --> 37:33.440
 two weeks out. But now they basically said, no, we have enough of an observation. We have enough

37:33.440 --> 37:39.200
 science here. We know what we see with different vaccines. Go ahead, get that COVID-19 vaccine

37:39.200 --> 37:44.000
 as soon as possible. Peter Wright, I'm an anesthesiologist and dentist here in New York's

37:44.000 --> 37:51.120
 good neighbor, Toronto, Ontario. So I was thankful to have had AstraZeneca first vaccine nine weeks

37:51.120 --> 37:56.800
 ago, no sequela. I was diagnosed with polycythemia Vira three years ago, managed with ASA and every

37:56.800 --> 38:03.120
 other month phlebotomy, because I turned 65 in late March protocols or be or to begin hydroxyurea

38:03.120 --> 38:09.280
 500 milligrams. I've been delaying starting my hydroxyurea till after I have my second vaccination,

38:09.280 --> 38:15.360
 thinking it may probably compromise my immune response with all the changing data regarding

38:15.360 --> 38:20.560
 from thrombotic events after the first AstraZeneca dose and preliminary reports regarding the

38:20.560 --> 38:26.400
 incident after second dose. Interested in your thoughts regarding the second vaccine and the timing

38:26.400 --> 38:33.760
 of hydroxyurea? Yeah, I mean, I I'm not sure that I sort of thinking through the immunology would be

38:33.760 --> 38:39.040
 concerned, but but that's not really the way we want to approach this. If you can go ahead and get

38:39.040 --> 38:43.920
 that vaccine, if it's fine to delay a little bit before you switch over the hydroxyurea,

38:43.920 --> 38:49.600
 that would probably be my personal preference. All right. And finally, from Jackie, I'm a pediatric

38:49.600 --> 38:54.480
 nurse practitioner. I do medical administration work for a large federally qualified health

38:54.480 --> 39:00.080
 center in Philadelphia. My colleagues and I love your show. So Jackie has a bunch of questions.

39:00.800 --> 39:05.760
 Let's see how many we can get through. Now that we have J&J, now that we know J&J has caused about

39:05.760 --> 39:11.200
 28ish cases of blood clots, could you help us compare risks to the background in the general

39:11.200 --> 39:18.080
 population, people with COVID and J&J recipients? Yes, I think that's an excellent question.

39:18.080 --> 39:22.800
 You know, when they went through the analysis of J&J and now, and I think this is evidence,

39:22.800 --> 39:27.920
 again, we have a really robust vaccine monitoring system. So we had the initial numbers we've now

39:27.920 --> 39:35.840
 seen, as mentioned, a number of other cases in a slightly broader demographic. The risk is still

39:35.840 --> 39:41.520
 low. It is still, you know, less than one in 100,000, you know, people is at one in 100,000,

39:41.520 --> 39:46.720
 one in 500,000, there are probably a little subtleties on teasing that out. But the risk

39:46.720 --> 39:52.560
 is incredibly rare. We've talked about that maybe being lower if we avoid women under the age of

39:52.560 --> 39:58.720
 50, right? So then maybe we get into a lower risk here. But you compare that to the risk of getting

39:58.720 --> 40:03.840
 COVID, the risk of complications if you get COVID. And that's what I tell people. I had a very

40:03.840 --> 40:08.880
 interesting rather long discussion with a patient who's actually a patient who had an

40:08.880 --> 40:15.040
 adolescent son, who had a developmental disorder. And, you know, and I said to her, listen,

40:15.600 --> 40:20.400
 there's a, you're making a decision either way, you're either deciding to get the vaccine,

40:20.400 --> 40:24.880
 or you're deciding to take the risk of getting COVID and the complications that come with that.

40:25.840 --> 40:31.520
 Boy, the risk of any vaccine is so much smaller than the risk of getting COVID during a pandemic

40:31.520 --> 40:33.520
 and all the complications that come from that.

40:33.520 --> 40:38.640
 Jackie, second question is about guidance for 12 to 15 year old group with regard to vaccination.

40:38.640 --> 40:44.400
 But that's answered, right? Both mRNA vaccines are authorized now for that age.

40:44.400 --> 40:50.080
 Just so currently just Pfizer, but Moderna is in the works for expansion. So they requested

40:50.080 --> 40:54.800
 every question. Yeah. So she should go should be any day now then, right?

40:56.480 --> 41:01.840
 You know, there's a period of when, when you request, they have to wait 15 days,

41:01.840 --> 41:06.480
 and then the FDA can grant it. So we're ending May, it'll be in June.

41:07.920 --> 41:11.920
 All right, could you talk a little bit about giving routine vaccinations along with COVID?

41:11.920 --> 41:16.000
 When will that be approved? I'd love to do 16 year old checkups over the summer. Give

41:16.000 --> 41:21.680
 that meningitis number two shot along with a stray HEP or an HPV plus COVID.

41:21.680 --> 41:26.160
 That would be my ideal universe as a pediatric nurse practitioner.

41:27.280 --> 41:32.400
 Well, we live in that world right here already, and we've lifted that space in

41:32.400 --> 41:37.200
 them apart. Go ahead. If you can get them in, if this is an opportunity to get those vaccines

41:37.200 --> 41:41.280
 into arms, you do not need to space them apart. This is absolutely fine.

41:42.080 --> 41:45.680
 And finally, could you talk a little bit more about monoclonal therapy? How to get

41:45.680 --> 41:51.360
 patients access? I know this is a mundane concern. Transportation is an issue for many patients,

41:51.360 --> 41:55.280
 and now you have a symptomatic patient. You've told the isolate how you're going to get them from

41:55.280 --> 42:00.960
 their home to the infusion center. How about therapy for children? Yeah, so this, this is,

42:00.960 --> 42:06.400
 as I said, we've expanded this a little bit out, but still it's, it's limited, right below 18.

42:06.400 --> 42:10.800
 It's probably 18 enough that really is broadened. There are certain number of indications for the

42:10.800 --> 42:16.960
 under-17 crowd. We have programs where you can get these in the home. What's going to be really

42:16.960 --> 42:22.640
 exciting and what a lot of people are working on is IM and sub-Q injection. So what can we do

42:22.640 --> 42:26.320
 right now? So right now, a lot of times it might be actually going, I'll say here in the New York

42:26.320 --> 42:32.000
 area, the Catholic health system do a great job of basically to show up at an ER and you can get

42:32.000 --> 42:37.920
 access. Northwell Health, one of our largest health systems here, actually has, you know,

42:37.920 --> 42:43.280
 the physician goes online, fills out some forms, and yes, the person would have to go to a tent

42:43.280 --> 42:50.880
 outside of an ER. For certain individuals, you can call the number and you can actually get

42:50.880 --> 42:55.600
 set up in home infusion, but we're hoping this is going to be something where, you know, a call

42:55.600 --> 43:01.280
 can go out to a pharmacy, something can be delivered to the home. One of the challenges still is that

43:01.280 --> 43:06.080
 rare, right, one in several thousand anaphylactic reactions. So if you're going to do it in the home,

43:06.080 --> 43:11.440
 you're probably still going to want someone who can be there to, you know, administer an EpiPen

43:11.440 --> 43:16.960
 and get Benadryl, you know, treat an anaphylactic reaction. That's COVID-19 clinical update number

43:16.960 --> 43:36.640
 64 with Dr. Daniel Griffin. Thank you, Daniel. Oh, thank you so much and everyone be safe.
