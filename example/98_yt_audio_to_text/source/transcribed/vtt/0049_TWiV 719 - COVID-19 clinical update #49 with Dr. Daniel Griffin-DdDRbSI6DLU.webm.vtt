 This week in virology, the podcast about viruses, the kind that make you sick.

00:10.320 --> 00:20.240
 From Microbe TV, this is Twiv, this week in virology, episode 719 recorded on February 11,

00:20.240 --> 00:27.600
 2021. I'm Vincent Racken Yello, and you're listening to the podcast all about viruses.

00:27.600 --> 00:34.400
 Joining me today from New York, Daniel Griffin. Hello, everyone. All right, we're a week later.

00:34.400 --> 00:41.440
 Is it any better, Daniel? You know, I am going to say yes. I'm going to say I'm

00:41.440 --> 00:47.040
 apparently I'm going to be on the news tonight at 7.30, after we finish Twiv. And I am going to say

00:47.040 --> 00:53.520
 then, you know, this will be dropped Saturday. So people won't know that I'm going to say

00:53.520 --> 00:59.040
 that we've really come over our crest. I mean, we were looking at over 300,000 new cases a day.

00:59.600 --> 01:06.160
 We crested over 5,000 deaths per day. And now we've dropped down to less than 200,000 cases

01:06.160 --> 01:12.240
 per day. And our deaths are actually getting down in the 2000s again, which is, you know,

01:12.240 --> 01:17.520
 horrible to say that that's better than where we were. And what's the reason for this downturn,

01:17.520 --> 01:22.320
 do we know? I think there's several things going on, Vincent. I think one of them is that,

01:22.320 --> 01:26.960
 you know, if you become infected, when you're infecting 300,000 people a day, you're taking

01:26.960 --> 01:31.440
 300,000 people who are probably not going to get reinfected in the next three or four months or so.

01:32.000 --> 01:37.360
 We're also ramping up vaccines, you know, over a million people are being vaccinated a day.

01:37.360 --> 01:43.040
 The other thing is we got past Christmas, New Year's, we got past all those big holiday times. So,

01:43.040 --> 01:48.000
 you know, and I understand it was a really bad Super Bowl. So hopefully we won't see much of a

01:48.000 --> 01:52.160
 surge after that. Okay, we've got a lot to cover today. And actually, I'm going to say

01:52.160 --> 01:58.800
 exciting new news, hot off the press we'll talk about today. But let me start off with my quotation.

01:59.600 --> 02:05.200
 And this is a quotation from the Great Gatsby by F Scott Fitzgerald, one of my favorite books.

02:05.200 --> 02:12.560
 People may not know, but I live in East Ag and I look across at West Ag where Gatsby was when he

02:13.440 --> 02:19.600
 Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgasmic future that year by year recedes before us.

02:19.600 --> 02:26.560
 It eluded us then, but that's no matter. Tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther,

02:26.560 --> 02:34.400
 and then one fine morning. So we beat on boats against the current, born ceaselessly into the past,

02:34.400 --> 02:40.640
 born back ceaselessly into the past. So all right, never miss an opportunity to vaccinate,

02:40.640 --> 02:46.560
 never miss an opportunity to test, never waste a vaccine dose. I hope everyone survived last

02:46.560 --> 02:51.840
 week's discussion of the variants. And yes, it was simplified. I left out the trimmers and

02:51.840 --> 02:57.920
 fear and cleavage sites and pre and post fusion confirmation changes. But my hope is that this

02:57.920 --> 03:03.760
 primer will help as we go forward. You know, I was thinking today, as I went in and one of my

03:03.760 --> 03:09.600
 patients had not made it through the night, how lucky we were when we talked about the Irish

03:09.600 --> 03:14.400
 patient that we got to follow his drama through not knowing how it was going to go and then see

03:14.400 --> 03:20.080
 him end up back home in Colorado. But unfortunately, that is not the outcome that all my patients

03:20.080 --> 03:25.760
 are experiencing. All right, the pre exposure period. So my stages paper is now published. It's

03:25.760 --> 03:31.200
 out there. I don't know if the full it's going to be open access to the full paper will be available

03:31.200 --> 03:38.560
 soon. But we're going to stick with these stages, the pre exposure period. So now two masks at a

03:38.560 --> 03:46.000
 time are being recommended or discussed by the CDC. In the MMWR, there was maximizing fit for

03:46.000 --> 03:51.680
 cloth and medical procedure mass to improve performance and reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission

03:51.680 --> 04:00.720
 and exposure 2021 in the MMWR. Testing, I want to say I have growing concerns about the reduction

04:00.720 --> 04:06.720
 in testing. I was looking at the COVID tracking project and they had reported that if there was

04:06.720 --> 04:13.600
 a significant drop in testing, I was able to confirm this in other sources. On January 18th,

04:13.600 --> 04:19.840
 the seven day average of daily new tests reached an all time high of over 2 million. Just to kind

04:19.840 --> 04:25.520
 of give people perspective, January 18th, one slash 20 was the Biden inauguration. That number

04:25.520 --> 04:31.680
 has now fallen well below that 2 million number. And that 2 million number is actually what our

04:31.680 --> 04:37.680
 public health experts consider an important threshold for allowing us to identify most of

04:37.680 --> 04:43.680
 the people with symptoms really to prevent them from spreading it to other individuals.

04:43.680 --> 04:51.680
 You know, in New York here locally, the 15th of January is when we reached our peak with 324,671

04:51.680 --> 04:59.680
 tests done in a single day. We're now seeing half that number, less than 200,000

04:59.680 --> 05:07.680
 really about 150,000 done per day. So we're really dropping. It was about a year ago that Michael

05:07.680 --> 05:13.680
 Mina started championing the idea of the home saliva, rapid saliva test, the liquor sticks,

05:13.680 --> 05:19.680
 a dollar or less. He was a guest on Twiv back in 640, Twiv 640 back in July.

05:19.680 --> 05:27.680
 Now there are several at home collection COVID tests. Most of them are male back offs. They're not

05:27.680 --> 05:32.800
 really doing the full thing. But back in December, a loom. This is an Australian based company

05:32.800 --> 05:39.040
 received an EUA for their 15 minute rapid in home antigen test. And recently, the White House

05:39.040 --> 05:46.960
 announced that the Department of Defense has committed $230.8 million to help a loom increase

05:46.960 --> 05:54.080
 its production of these at home tests. As per the loom CEO, Sean Parsons, we certainly would

05:54.080 --> 05:59.120
 like to see this priced in the $30 range. But he admits it will definitely start at more than

05:59.120 --> 06:06.400
 that $30 per test. That's a lot of money. So really not quite where I would like to see it be.

06:07.200 --> 06:13.760
 Active vaccination, I'm going to call this the good, the bad and the ugly. The ugly is all the

06:13.760 --> 06:19.200
 equity with access. The bad as we've really created a system that made access to vaccination,

06:19.200 --> 06:25.280
 very complicated, frustrating. And by its very nature, easier for wealthy, healthy and more

06:25.280 --> 06:31.040
 educated to access. The good though is that it does look like this is about to turn around

06:31.040 --> 06:37.120
 and improve at least for the US. I'm hoping the rest of the world after that. But the CDC has a

06:37.120 --> 06:45.600
 COVID-19 vaccine data tracker. And actually, we're really seeing the number ramp up of vaccines

06:45.600 --> 06:53.280
 per day. It's over a million per day. Here in New York, we are below average. We're bottom

06:53.280 --> 06:57.600
 dwellers. We're in the bottom half. Alaska is doing the best. Nevada is doing the worst.

06:57.600 --> 07:02.720
 Based upon percent of doses received and then being administered, we have places like North

07:02.720 --> 07:10.800
 Dakota, where 95% of the doses end up administered. In New York, we're down. Only about 70% of the

07:10.800 --> 07:16.080
 doses delivered are administered, about 30% of them. So about a third of them end up sitting in

07:16.080 --> 07:22.320
 freezers. But we expect this to turn around soon. Just give people, you know, it is February on the

07:22.320 --> 07:30.640
 26th, J&J is going to be going for EUA. And we are hoping that by April, the supply outstrips

07:30.640 --> 07:37.120
 demand. Moderna has ramped up its production and deliveries. Pfizer has reported a doubling of

07:37.120 --> 07:42.400
 its production per month by having its production time through increased efficiencies. A nice

07:42.400 --> 07:47.360
 story about that USA today this last week. I do want to share some concerning developments if

07:47.360 --> 07:53.200
 people are not watching what's happening down in Manasse, Brazil. And this was a situation where

07:53.840 --> 08:00.240
 the first wave of the virus ran rampant. Really, there was a decision made. And what ended up

08:00.240 --> 08:05.760
 happening was it ran through. About 5% or 6% of the population died. It was mostly the older,

08:05.760 --> 08:12.400
 the more vulnerable. By October 2020, there's a nice Lancet article on this called resurgence

08:12.400 --> 08:18.080
 of COVID-19 in the NOSF Brazil, despite high seroprevalence. And as they report in the Lancet,

08:18.080 --> 08:27.280
 by October 2020, 76% of the population that was still alive was deemed infected, previously

08:27.280 --> 08:34.320
 infected based on serological testing. But now we're seeing an increase. We're seeing a second wave.

08:34.320 --> 08:41.040
 This time, the hospitalization rate is 2.5 times what we saw with the first wave. We're seeing a

08:41.040 --> 08:47.360
 20% higher per day mortality than happened the first time. And the surge is so large that hospitals

08:47.360 --> 08:52.640
 have run out of oxygen. And patients on ventilators who need extraction debris are literally suffocating

08:52.640 --> 08:59.600
 in hospital beds. So not much of an endorsement for this, you know, Great Barrington. Let's try

08:59.600 --> 09:04.800
 to achieve herd immunity with natural infection. I'm going to get to the next question. Still in

09:04.800 --> 09:10.960
 the vaccine section, does vaccination impact transmission? And we just this week, there was

09:10.960 --> 09:17.520
 an update from the CDC where they actually do couch this. So I will comment, but they say vaccinated

09:17.520 --> 09:24.880
 persons with an exposure to someone with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 are not required to quarantine

09:24.880 --> 09:30.720
 if they meet the following criteria, right? So this is a change. If they're fully vaccinated,

09:30.720 --> 09:36.960
 so they passed two weeks following the receipt of that second dose in a two dose series. But they're

09:36.960 --> 09:40.800
 also kind of getting ready. They're saying we're greater than two weeks following receipt of one

09:40.800 --> 09:46.240
 dose of a single dose vaccine. I think they're thinking J and J might get approved. They're within

09:46.240 --> 09:53.200
 three months of the receipt of the last dose in the series. And they're remaining asymptomatic.

09:53.200 --> 09:58.240
 And that's up on the CDC website. And they actually they they catch this and they explain they say,

09:58.240 --> 10:04.480
 okay, although the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from vaccinated persons to others is still uncertain,

10:04.480 --> 10:07.920
 vaccination has been demonstrated to prevent symptomatic COVID-19.

10:08.560 --> 10:13.200
 Symptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission is thought to have a greater role in transmission

10:13.200 --> 10:18.240
 than purely a symptomatic transmission. And additionally, individual and societal benefits

10:18.240 --> 10:24.400
 of avoiding unnecessary quarantine may outweigh the potential but unknown risk of transmission

10:24.400 --> 10:29.120
 and facilitate the direction of public health resources to persons at highest risk

10:29.120 --> 10:35.200
 for transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to others. So this is a bit of a change. This is a bit of an update.

10:36.320 --> 10:42.640
 I kept hearing about transmission evidence out of Israel. And on the 8th, the paper,

10:42.640 --> 10:49.360
 initial real world evidence for lower viral load of individuals who have been vaccinated by

10:49.360 --> 10:59.200
 BNT162b2 became available on GitHub. So two things. Well, the BNT162b2, that's the Pfizer vaccine.

10:59.200 --> 11:06.480
 And what is GitHub? This is actually interesting. This was a website originally set up for developers

11:06.480 --> 11:10.720
 and companies to share and maintain software. I actually used it when I was writing one of our

11:10.720 --> 11:15.920
 textbooks. It's sort of a way to share files, but sort of interesting. Another way for things to

11:15.920 --> 11:21.680
 just get out there. And what they reported here, and I don't want to spend too much time on this,

11:22.240 --> 11:28.720
 because they report that there was a drop in the average CT values when they looked at people

11:28.720 --> 11:36.160
 over a certain age with a 75% vaccination penetrance versus people at a lower age with a lower vaccination

11:36.160 --> 11:42.080
 penetrance. But they actually should have, I think, called this statistically significant,

11:42.080 --> 11:48.160
 because what they really came out to was instead of about a 26.5, they were seeing CT values of

11:48.160 --> 11:55.760
 about 27.5. So only one CT value difference. So instead of an average RNA copy number of

11:56.880 --> 12:03.280
 800,000, they're seeing an RNA copy number of 400,000 on average. So still in a level where

12:03.280 --> 12:09.440
 we think there's transmission. So I think this is a complicated issue, or we'll learn more about it.

12:10.320 --> 12:17.040
 All right, still in this pre-exposure period, we continue to recommend that people exercise,

12:17.600 --> 12:25.280
 no reason to go into a COVID exposure vitamin deficient. There actually was a paper in the

12:25.280 --> 12:30.560
 Lancet, Diabetes and Endocrinology, entitled Vitamin D and COVID-19, Why the Controversy.

12:30.560 --> 12:35.920
 And I guess I'm all along lines with this. I don't think anyone is going to propose that we do a

12:35.920 --> 12:40.240
 study where you have half the group vitamin D deficient and the other replete. I think across

12:40.240 --> 12:45.600
 the board, there is no reason to be vitamin D deficient. So I think that that can just be closed. Take

12:45.600 --> 12:52.000
 your vitamin D, don't be vitamin D deficient, exercise, don't put on extra pounds, those pandemic

12:52.000 --> 12:58.160
 pounds, be careful, try to be as healthy as you can. Passive vaccination. This was exciting,

12:58.160 --> 13:05.600
 another exciting week. Lily's bamlinibamab, administered with atessa bamab, received FDA

13:05.600 --> 13:13.440
 EUA for COVID-19. So this is now Eli Lilly has a cocktail as well, and it gets even more exciting.

13:13.440 --> 13:20.080
 If you give just bamlinibamab, instead of an hour, you can infuse it over 16 minutes. If you do the

13:20.080 --> 13:27.840
 cocktail, 21 minutes. So this is really going to improve access. As a treatment reminder,

13:27.840 --> 13:32.720
 it's really critical that you get this in during the first seven to 10 days was another study

13:33.360 --> 13:37.440
 out there where really if you give if you give monoclonal's late, if you wait till someone's

13:37.440 --> 13:43.040
 already, you know, in the ICU till it's late in that second week, if you miss that front window,

13:43.760 --> 13:49.200
 you don't do anyone any help. We've been actually infusing a lot of people through the united

13:49.200 --> 13:55.840
 in research study. And this has been great to give people access to monoclonal therapy in the

13:55.840 --> 14:01.600
 comfort of their own home through infusions. We get into our early inflammatory phase,

14:01.600 --> 14:06.800
 and maybe just as a reminder, still remdesivir still being used in hospitalized patients with

14:06.800 --> 14:14.960
 oxygen saturations less than 94%. A little broader with regard to not limiting it based upon renal

14:14.960 --> 14:23.680
 function steroids. Again, second week oxygen saturations less than 94. We discussed last time

14:23.680 --> 14:32.800
 updated data on anticoagulation. A number of studies that were showing that in ICU, critically ill

14:32.800 --> 14:38.000
 patients that prophylactic dosing anticoagulation was associated with the best outcomes. But in

14:38.000 --> 14:44.640
 your moderately ill floor patients, that full dose anticoagulation was associated with the best outcomes.

14:44.640 --> 14:51.280
 But some exciting new news on tocelism map. I've been waiting for this for quite a while,

14:51.280 --> 14:59.200
 actually. And this is the recovery data. So just put on a preprint tocelism map in patients admitted

14:59.200 --> 15:06.240
 to hospital with COVID-19 recovery trial, preliminary results of a randomized controlled open label

15:06.240 --> 15:12.400
 platform trial. This is a preprint. But I got a chance to look through this. This study looked

15:12.400 --> 15:20.960
 at over 4000 adults, and the patients were allocated to receive tocelism map either as a single dose

15:20.960 --> 15:26.320
 or a second dose. And actually, there's a weight based adjustment. So as high as 800 milligrams,

15:27.040 --> 15:32.240
 or down to 400 milligrams based upon various weights, you can look up and, you know,

15:32.240 --> 15:37.040
 find the dose for your patient. But a lot of times you'll use this flat 400. This was an adjusted,

15:37.040 --> 15:42.560
 just like in REM cap, patients allocated to tocelism map were more likely to be discharged from the

15:42.560 --> 15:51.760
 patient from the hospital alive within 28 days. So 54% versus 47% with a rate ratio of 1.23 p-value

15:51.760 --> 16:02.480
 of 0.0001. Among those not receiving invasive mechanical ventilation, less likely to end up

16:02.480 --> 16:12.320
 on a mechanical ventilator or die. So 33 versus 38. And again, p-value of 0.0005. So let me translate

16:12.320 --> 16:19.120
 this. These patients had a background of steroids. And if tosy was given with a background of steroids,

16:19.120 --> 16:28.880
 there was a 14% reduction in 28 day mortality with a p-value of less than 0.007. And almost a 20%

16:28.880 --> 16:36.320
 reduction in the risk of requiring intubation with a p-value of 0.01. So this builds on the REM cap data,

16:36.320 --> 16:43.520
 starting to get a sense of when and in what context and how to use tosy in a manner that is

16:43.520 --> 16:51.440
 associated with, I think, really clear, well-designed trial data supporting a mortality benefit as

16:51.440 --> 16:57.040
 well as a better outcome, not ending up on a mechanical ventilator. Secondary infection phase,

16:58.000 --> 17:03.440
 you know, I always tell people remember your fungal and your bacterial infections. This is a later

17:03.440 --> 17:08.400
 part of the disease. Most people coming in are not infected, but there was another nice article

17:08.400 --> 17:15.600
 in open form infectious disease, bacterial super infections among persons with coronavirus disease

17:15.600 --> 17:21.520
 2019, a comprehensive review of data from postmortem studies. So these are people who ended up

17:21.520 --> 17:26.000
 dying, right? So it's not just looking at everyone, it's looking at the people that actually died

17:26.000 --> 17:31.920
 from COVID-19. And I think interesting here is which pathogens did you see people die from? So

17:31.920 --> 17:39.360
 asinidobacter balmani, staphylococcus aureus, right? I think we've talked about that before,

17:40.080 --> 17:47.440
 pseudomonas aruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. So long super infections were the causes of death

17:47.440 --> 17:55.200
 in about 16%. And so we're seeing these infections, but remember, we're also seeing some fungal

17:55.200 --> 18:00.880
 infections, seeing a few cryptococcal infections, just sort of to remember it's not just aspergillus

18:00.880 --> 18:05.840
 and candidemia. I also want to put a plug in here for TWIP. After we record this, we're going to

18:05.840 --> 18:11.840
 record TWIP. And we're going to have our mystery case. And I don't want to give away the answer,

18:11.840 --> 18:19.440
 but I may say that this may be a situation where Ivermectin saves the day. So just a teaser,

18:19.440 --> 18:26.160
 listen to this week in parasitism. Okay, the multi-system inflammatory phase. This is a

18:26.160 --> 18:29.600
 reminder, and we keep seeing this a couple of times today, people are being clapped out of the

18:29.600 --> 18:36.240
 hospital. This is a bi-modal disease. People come in during that early inflammatory phase.

18:36.240 --> 18:41.280
 We treat them, they're often doing better. But remember, 10 to 15% of those folks are either

18:41.280 --> 18:46.640
 going to die in the next 30 days or get readmitted. So a lot of times they get better. And then they

18:46.640 --> 18:53.520
 have this second late inflammatory, this multi-system inflammatory phase. And so don't just clap them

18:53.520 --> 18:58.800
 out, make sure they have good close follow up, and make sure you're ready to jump in at that

18:58.800 --> 19:06.720
 point as well. The tail phase, this sort of actually overlaps the post hospital plan. So we want to be

19:06.720 --> 19:11.760
 thinking about what the appropriate anti-quagulation recommendations will be. And actually, we're

19:11.760 --> 19:16.800
 going to meet at Ash and try to come up with some evidence-based guidance there based upon what

19:16.800 --> 19:21.600
 people are doing, what the studies are. But I also want to talk a little bit about treatment

19:21.600 --> 19:27.040
 here. I still find it frustrating. I'm sure a lot of our listeners who have long COVID

19:27.040 --> 19:33.440
 find it frustrating that we still don't have a lot of really good data-driven interventions

19:33.440 --> 19:39.360
 to help with long COVID. We take care of a lot of COVID patients, long COVID patients here in

19:39.360 --> 19:43.840
 New York at Pro Health. But we're trying to consolidate our COVID care, actually. So we can

19:43.840 --> 19:49.280
 really learn from each other, learn from patients. So I think one of the big things I just want to

19:49.280 --> 19:55.280
 throw in here before we close is that people who have long COVID, who are having problems

19:55.280 --> 20:00.240
 exercising, have problems going upstairs. There's a subset that has a significant

20:00.240 --> 20:05.120
 post-exertional malaise issue. These aren't people who can just buck up and gradually

20:05.120 --> 20:11.040
 increase their exercise. These are people who need to be treated differently. So you really

20:11.040 --> 20:15.680
 want to screen for that in your guidance of what these people are going to be doing.

20:16.560 --> 20:20.880
 So let me close with our fundraiser before we hit emails. And I want to say thank you,

20:20.880 --> 20:26.080
 everyone, who's already gone to parasiteswithoutborders.com and started to contribute. Because

20:26.080 --> 20:32.400
 through the months of February and March, donations made to parasites without borders will be matched

20:32.400 --> 20:38.480
 and doubled by TWB and donated to the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene,

20:38.480 --> 20:43.600
 including scholarships for their annual meeting travel awards. And I'm going to focus on that.

20:43.600 --> 20:53.920
 We are going to try to raise money and bring women, early career women, from low-income parts of the

20:53.920 --> 21:00.960
 world to the annual American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene meeting, really help them

21:00.960 --> 21:07.840
 invest in these young women. And hopefully, instead of 15% of the leadership in so much of

21:07.840 --> 21:12.880
 science being old white men, we can actually increase the diversity and the opportunity.

21:12.880 --> 21:18.320
 So help us do that, help us make a difference. Our first email is from Dagfin, who's writing from

21:18.320 --> 21:25.200
 Oslo, Norway, where it's minus nine Celsius. A question regarding a group of patients frequently

21:25.200 --> 21:32.960
 overlooked drug-addicted patients who Dagfin works with, according to their national service,

21:32.960 --> 21:39.280
 they are a Norway for not a single case among these patients have been reported. And he sees

21:39.280 --> 21:43.920
 similar reports from other countries. Do you have any idea why this group of patients who are

21:43.920 --> 21:48.960
 usually very susceptible to infection seems to be nearly unaffected by SARS-CoV-2 virus?

21:48.960 --> 21:55.600
 Yeah, I have to say that that is an interesting observation. And though I haven't seen a lot of

21:55.600 --> 22:01.760
 data here, that actually goes along with my experience. We, as infectious disease physicians,

22:01.760 --> 22:08.400
 interact with and take care of a lot of intravenous drug users, develop a lot of

22:08.400 --> 22:13.840
 bloodstream infections, endocarditis, things like that. Unfortunately, what we have seen in the

22:13.840 --> 22:19.680
 United States is a significant increase in the amount of drug abuse deaths due to drug-associated

22:19.680 --> 22:25.360
 overdoses. But no, my experience has actually been in Lises. We are not seeing a lot of those

22:25.360 --> 22:30.960
 individuals. I don't know if it's a younger demographic. You would think that their comorbidities and

22:30.960 --> 22:36.000
 the other problems would put them at higher risk for COVID. But no, that actually is in line and

22:36.000 --> 22:41.120
 very interesting observation. Laura writes, are there any data about different vaccines ability

22:41.120 --> 22:47.600
 to prevent long COVID? Laura is in vaccine priority group two, seems likely by the time she's vaccinated,

22:47.600 --> 22:52.240
 multiple vaccines will be given to you ways. The messaging I've heard in the news is if you're

22:52.240 --> 22:56.720
 offered a vaccine, take it. However, I'm fortunate to be in a demographic where hospitalization and

22:56.720 --> 23:02.960
 death are extremely unlikely. So my primary concern has been long COVID as a healthy 40-year-old woman

23:02.960 --> 23:07.600
 with autoimmune disease. Since studies have shown that even a relatively mild case of COVID can lead

23:07.600 --> 23:11.680
 to long COVID, it seems to me I would want to choose the vaccine that has the highest

23:12.240 --> 23:17.440
 efficacy of preventing disease of any severity. Yeah, no, that's an excellent point, right? And

23:17.440 --> 23:21.840
 I think you could sort of do the math on this. You would say, okay, so let's take the mRNA vaccines,

23:21.840 --> 23:29.280
 95% reduction in symptomatic disease. We're not really seeing long COVID in people who suddenly

23:29.280 --> 23:33.280
 develop symptoms and then find out through serology they were asymptomatically infected.

23:34.400 --> 23:40.160
 Clearly, the majority, if not all, of people who developed long COVID had some degree of

23:40.160 --> 23:44.640
 symptomatic COVID. It isn't necessarily that you need to be severe enough to be in the hospital,

23:44.640 --> 23:50.000
 so preventing severe disease is not necessarily enough. Preventing symptomatic disease seems to be

23:50.000 --> 23:55.520
 something we want to do. We are hoping that people who've been vaccinated are less likely to develop

23:55.520 --> 23:59.840
 long COVID. And I was actually speaking to one of my colleagues today for Tima Johari,

23:59.840 --> 24:04.880
 people who have gotten even a single dose of vaccine when they get COVID, this unfortunately

24:04.880 --> 24:09.840
 has happened, they tended to quite well. So I'm very optimistic that the vaccines across the

24:09.840 --> 24:13.920
 board are going to reduce the risk of long COVID. At this point, we don't know, and we're still

24:13.920 --> 24:17.760
 going to keep an eye on this. Millions of people are being vaccinated, but I see your point,

24:17.760 --> 24:24.640
 the J&J, what if we say, oh, it's less effective at preventing mild disease? Are those people with

24:24.640 --> 24:29.680
 mild disease who got a JJ vaccine? Are they going to be at a significant risk of going on

24:29.680 --> 24:34.960
 to long COVID? We certainly don't know. But that I think is an important thing for us to keep an eye

24:34.960 --> 24:40.160
 on. Aviva wants to know about Passover coming up in a month and a half. They will have

24:41.680 --> 24:45.600
 six adults and three kids. The adults will all be vaccinated, the kids not,

24:46.800 --> 24:51.040
 and they want to know, is it safe? We can test the kids, we can keep them home from school,

24:51.040 --> 24:56.800
 we can test them again. There's a debate in this family as to whether this is safe to do. We value

24:56.800 --> 25:03.040
 your input. Okay, no, I mean, I am going to have the same situation. I don't know if people notice

25:03.040 --> 25:10.480
 or know this, but I will be celebrating Passover. The current plan is my dad's birthday

25:10.480 --> 25:16.960
 corresponds with the first Sator, the first night. And so our plan, my mother, is going to be fully

25:16.960 --> 25:23.040
 vaccinated. My father will be fully vaccinated. I will be fully vaccinated. And then my wife,

25:23.040 --> 25:28.880
 myself and our children. So that's going to be seven of us together. You know, I will recommend

25:28.880 --> 25:34.640
 that everyone gets tested. Preferably, you know, the morning, right, it's going to be a Saturday

25:34.640 --> 25:39.680
 is the first night, I believe. Hopefully I got that right. You know, everyone gets tested before.

25:40.720 --> 25:45.840
 My parents, I actually say, hey, they've been vaccinated. I'm not particularly worried about

25:45.840 --> 25:50.800
 them. It's more the risk, you know, my wife is not going to be vaccinated by them. My children

25:50.800 --> 25:55.360
 will not be vaccinated by then. I think this is one of the things once people have been vaccinated,

25:55.360 --> 25:59.680
 you don't want to undersell and say you can't change things. I actually think that a year ago,

25:59.680 --> 26:05.280
 when my parents were not vaccinated, we did not have Passover with them. This year with them

26:05.280 --> 26:10.320
 being vaccinated, I actually think we're going to go ahead. And I think that that is a reasonable

26:10.320 --> 26:16.640
 risk, but nothing's 100% safe. So you want to consider all this. If my wife, for instance, had

26:16.640 --> 26:21.840
 health issues, she had, you know, problems with her immune system, I might rethink that. So you

26:21.840 --> 26:26.800
 want to you want to make this an individual decision for everyone. One more from Eugene in Atlanta.

26:27.360 --> 26:33.040
 What are your thoughts on getting mRNA vaccine people being immunosuppressed with diseases such

26:33.040 --> 26:37.920
 as crone and treated with drugs like stelara? I would imagine not to miss the opportunity of

26:37.920 --> 26:43.360
 getting the vaccine, then perhaps resuming the drugs sometime after the second vaccine dose.

26:43.360 --> 26:48.800
 Yeah, that is routinely what we're doing. We're still recommending the vaccination. We're not sure

26:48.800 --> 26:54.800
 that it will be as effective in these individuals as it would be in someone who has an intact immune

26:54.800 --> 26:59.360
 system who's not an immunosuppressant. And this might actually be the population of

27:00.400 --> 27:05.840
 communicating with one of the oncologists today, patients who are on certain drugs that interfere

27:05.840 --> 27:11.200
 with B cell and other immune function. This might be a situation we actually do do one of these

27:11.200 --> 27:17.280
 semi quantitative anti spike serology tests. But no, we're recommending that people get

27:17.280 --> 27:21.520
 vaccinated. We're just a little concerned. They may not get as robust a protection.

27:21.520 --> 27:27.360
 That's COVID-19 clinical update number 49 with Dr. Daniel Griffin. Thank you, Daniel.

27:27.360 --> 27:36.400
 Oh, thank you so much. And everyone be safe. It's so close to the spring. We're going to make it.
