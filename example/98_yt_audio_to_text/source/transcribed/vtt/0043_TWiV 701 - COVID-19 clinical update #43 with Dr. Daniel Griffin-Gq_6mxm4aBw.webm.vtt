 This week in virology, the podcast about viruses, the kind that make you sick.

00:10.160 --> 00:21.520
 From Microbe TV, this is Twiv, this week in virology. Episode 701 recorded on December 31, 2020.

00:21.520 --> 00:28.000
 I'm Vincent Rackeniello, and you're listening to the podcast All About Viruses. Joining me today

00:28.000 --> 00:36.880
 from New York, Daniel Griffin. Hello, everyone. Daniel, it is our 43rd update from you this year.

00:36.880 --> 00:44.960
 It's the end of 2020. That's it. Good read-ins. Not to you, Vincent, but to 2020. It has been

00:45.920 --> 00:50.400
 what an awful year. It really has. But let's get to it. We got a lot to do today.

00:51.200 --> 00:56.080
 So when this drops, it's actually going to be New Year's Day. So we're recording on New Year's Eve.

00:56.080 --> 01:00.720
 This is going to be dropping, I guess, on New Year's, so the 1st or 2nd January.

01:01.360 --> 01:08.160
 So let's start with our quotation. Should old acquaintance be forgot and never thought upon,

01:08.720 --> 01:15.280
 the flames of love extinguished and fully passed and gone, is thy sweet heart not grown so cold,

01:16.080 --> 01:22.560
 that loving breast of thine, that thou canst never once reflect on old, long,

01:22.560 --> 01:28.880
 zine. And I'll say, old, long, zine, lovely translates as days gone by. So that's that thou

01:28.880 --> 01:36.400
 canst never once reflect on days gone by. So this is by Robert Burns. And for me, this is actually

01:36.400 --> 01:45.280
 sort of a very, very appropriate poem, shall I say, turned into a song because it was actually,

01:45.280 --> 01:51.360
 I was in Scotland. I was in Glasgow in the end of January. And actually, I was there for

01:51.360 --> 01:58.800
 Burns Day where they celebrate the Laureate poet, Robert Burns. And that was right before the Chinese

01:58.800 --> 02:08.880
 New Year, right before the sky did fall. So patient updates. You know, I think that everyone is aware

02:08.880 --> 02:15.440
 of how difficult it has gotten over the last bit of time. And you know, Christmas was really tough

02:15.440 --> 02:21.120
 for me to see, you know, eight families having lost someone on that day. And I guess somewhere

02:21.120 --> 02:26.160
 in my mind, I had this idea that, you know, Christmas is a day when people shouldn't die,

02:26.160 --> 02:30.480
 you know, if there's any sort of greater power than myself in the world, greater power than all

02:30.480 --> 02:35.840
 of us in the world. And so just really traumatic that people continue to die, just, you know,

02:35.840 --> 02:42.800
 record numbers, growing numbers every day. But what I want to do today, and I know that people are,

02:42.800 --> 02:47.040
 people are busy, and I was trying to make this the clinical update for the busy clinician,

02:47.040 --> 02:52.000
 but I know a lot of other people listen. But at a year end, I wanted to do an update on what

02:52.000 --> 03:00.080
 we've learned this last year. And it really has been a credible year, sort of back and forth,

03:00.080 --> 03:05.280
 from really early on in the year, when reports, you know, the risk of coronavirus in the U.S.

03:05.280 --> 03:08.960
 is miniscule, worry about the real and present danger of seasonal flu,

03:10.000 --> 03:16.000
 articles, coronavirus is bad, comparing it to the flu is worse, to shutdowns, the mask wars,

03:16.000 --> 03:20.080
 people threatening to drive pickup trucks into the building if they're, if they're dead,

03:20.080 --> 03:26.480
 did not get 8CQ to threats if we did give 8CQ. And then some very strange stuff about bleach

03:26.480 --> 03:32.240
 and swallowing flashlights and rattlesnake venom. So we have actually learned a lot,

03:32.240 --> 03:37.760
 and let's go through it, really rapid fire. So we'll start off with the pre-exposure period.

03:38.800 --> 03:43.040
 And I'm going to talk a lot, actually, about non-pharmaceutical interventions,

03:43.040 --> 03:47.360
 which actually I spend a lot of time doing. I'm sort of waiting for, I don't know, maybe the

03:47.360 --> 03:51.840
 pharmaceutical bots to be like, Dr. Griffin, why do you talk about so much about non-pharmaceutical

03:51.840 --> 03:56.320
 interventions? Why don't you push our drugs a little bit more? But oh, well, I haven't seen that

03:56.320 --> 04:02.160
 happen yet. So let's go through it. One, we have a really broad appreciation. Not everyone's on

04:02.160 --> 04:08.560
 board, but I'll say a broad appreciation that masks, protect others, and actually they protect

04:08.560 --> 04:15.120
 us as well. And please cover those nose holes, unless you're a, I guess, just a mouth breather.

04:16.640 --> 04:21.840
 Physical distancing, 6 feet or greater helps. Remember, there's no magical wall at 6 feet. I

04:21.840 --> 04:28.080
 think people are getting a little more sophisticated. 6 feet is really what we recommend, 7, 8. It's

04:28.080 --> 04:34.640
 exponential, the decrease. There's nothing magic about 6 feet. And if you lean into 5, 4, you're

04:34.640 --> 04:38.960
 starting to really dramatically increase your risk. If you can back up, that's better.

04:39.840 --> 04:45.440
 Outdoors is safer than indoors. We have a number of studies on this. And it's about a 20-fold

04:45.440 --> 04:51.920
 difference in your risk of getting infected indoors versus outdoors. But it's not absolute,

04:51.920 --> 04:58.880
 right? Air exchange matters. So indoor at someone's house, a suburban home without good ventilation,

04:58.880 --> 05:04.000
 without good air exchange, that's about the highest risk. I bring that up right here around

05:04.000 --> 05:11.280
 the holidays. Limiting the size of gathering reduces risks, right? Each extra person

05:11.280 --> 05:17.040
 is one extra person who could be bringing the virus into your circle. So the fewer people are

05:17.040 --> 05:22.080
 the better. You know, I know this is tough for people that, like hanging out with other people,

05:22.080 --> 05:27.040
 which is pretty much all of us. Washing hands, I'm hoping this is here's stay.

05:28.240 --> 05:32.720
 Hygiene helps. We do know that we overdid it a little bit with surfaces, your risk of getting

05:32.720 --> 05:39.920
 COVID from a surface is really low. We say less than 10% of cases are spread that way. This is really

05:39.920 --> 05:44.320
 person-to-person. You're getting it through the air. You're breathing it in. You're getting

05:44.320 --> 05:50.720
 it on a mucous membranes. Frequent testing, even of asymptomatic people, can save lives. And we're

05:50.720 --> 05:58.240
 seeing more and more data supporting that perspective. Symptom checking helps. But as we now know,

05:58.240 --> 06:04.160
 much spread is done by the asymptomatic or the pre-symptomatic. Not saying you shouldn't

06:04.160 --> 06:08.480
 symptom check, but just saying we need to keep in mind that that person who looks like they're

06:08.480 --> 06:16.480
 doing fine could have the infection. Remember, this is an invisible thing. Being healthy,

06:16.480 --> 06:22.000
 eating right, exercising, not carrying that extra weight, optimizing your medical conditions,

06:22.800 --> 06:28.000
 not walking around vitamin deficient. These may all help decrease your risk of not only getting

06:28.000 --> 06:35.040
 infected, but also surviving if you do get infected. And now we've got good old or, shall I say,

06:35.040 --> 06:41.040
 good modern, highly effective vaccines that we're adding to this pre-exposure period.

06:41.040 --> 06:45.120
 And in the future, when we actually get to it, I'll talk about the idea of using not only the

06:45.120 --> 06:51.200
 active vaccines, but maybe even passive vaccines to try to give people antibodies during high-risk

06:51.200 --> 06:56.720
 periods. So there's some ongoing studies there. Schools. We've learned that we can open schools

06:56.720 --> 07:03.680
 safely, but also that we can do it unsafely to do its safest cost money. We actually have some

07:03.680 --> 07:09.200
 estimates about how much money needs to be spent. If you're going to try to do this in a safer manner,

07:10.000 --> 07:15.840
 the safer openings involve limiting class sizes, physical distancing, wherein those masks,

07:15.840 --> 07:22.800
 proper ventilation, increasing staffing, hygiene stations, and testing. The whole idea of the

07:22.800 --> 07:27.840
 kids taking off their masks to eat in school. That's still an issue for me. I mean, that's

07:27.840 --> 07:32.240
 indoor dining. So if the parents shouldn't be doing that, I'm not sure the kids should.

07:33.040 --> 07:36.400
 Do I put that as a challenge to the schools? I think I've mentioned there's some schools

07:36.400 --> 07:42.560
 here on the South Shore. Did a kids go in the morning, they go home, eat their lunch at home,

07:42.560 --> 07:47.120
 another group is doing it in the afternoon. They're doing sort of a hybrid model with remote learning.

07:47.120 --> 07:53.760
 I worry. January, February, with really these rising rates, the whole idea of having kids take

07:53.760 --> 08:00.400
 their masks off and eat inside the schools, have teachers or higher risk older individuals,

08:02.240 --> 08:06.880
 basically in a closed indoor setting with kids with masks off. So I just throw that out there.

08:06.880 --> 08:12.640
 We've learned a lot about how this virus is spread. Incubation period, right? So now you've

08:12.640 --> 08:19.360
 been exposed and we really have a good sense of what is a high risk exposure. This is your

08:19.360 --> 08:25.440
 within that six feet for 15 minutes or longer. It's cumulative, right? You can't walk away and

08:25.440 --> 08:34.800
 reset the clock. So 15 minutes cumulative. No mask indoors, as mentioned, is higher risk than outdoors.

08:36.160 --> 08:41.760
 Being around a person who actually is in that zone of very high levels of virus. So this is about

08:41.760 --> 08:48.000
 two days about, but the WHO and CDC will contact trace four days prior, but about two days prior

08:48.000 --> 08:53.680
 to symptom onset. And really, in most cases, for about four to five days post symptom onset,

08:53.680 --> 09:00.000
 but that can go out for about as far as 10 days in your mild outpatient cases and as far out as

09:00.000 --> 09:06.480
 20 days in your more severe cases. So keep those in mind. Things have been sort of updated and

09:06.480 --> 09:12.720
 made simpler. So you've been exposed. We're talking about quarantines to 10 days. We're

09:12.720 --> 09:18.800
 also talking about isolation of the infected out to 10 days. So even though we know that

09:18.800 --> 09:23.840
 incubation period is really two to 14 days, there's only a few percent past 10. We're trying to keep

09:23.840 --> 09:28.320
 it simple. We're trying to come up with something that is reasonable enough that people will actually

09:28.320 --> 09:35.440
 follow our guidance. So you get exposed. Anytime the next two to 14 days, you could develop symptoms.

09:35.440 --> 09:40.800
 You could become positive. Remember, half of the cases are going to become positive.

09:40.800 --> 09:44.320
 They're going to have virus. They're going to potentially spread virus. Never have symptoms.

09:44.320 --> 09:50.800
 So we've been learning a lot here. Now, what about this period of detectable viral replication?

09:50.800 --> 09:57.360
 So someone's been exposed. The virus is replicating. It is now replicated to the point that it is

09:57.360 --> 10:01.840
 detectable. A couple of things here that I really want to try out. I'm going to really work hard

10:01.840 --> 10:08.160
 to get the word out. What can we do to keep people out of the hospital? And there is only one

10:08.160 --> 10:15.520
 evidence-based intervention at this point. I'll get some emails on that, but I'm going to say that.

10:16.320 --> 10:22.320
 And this is an EUA access therapy. This is a pharmaceutical. So pharmaceutical companies

10:22.320 --> 10:28.880
 don't have to send me a hate mail anymore. Monoclonal antibody. This is the bamblinibimab

10:28.880 --> 10:35.520
 or the bambam made by Eli Lilly. This is the Regeneron cocktail. Ideally, you give this to

10:35.520 --> 10:42.160
 someone in the first week out to maybe the first 10 days from symptom onset. If you get this to

10:42.160 --> 10:49.760
 people within that period of time, at least the data we have predicts about 75% reduction with the

10:49.760 --> 10:55.760
 bamblinibimab of them progressing to require any medical support. So you take someone who's high

10:55.760 --> 11:01.360
 risk, we'll say 10% or higher chance of ending up in the hospital. They get this infusion. It takes

11:01.360 --> 11:07.200
 an hour. 75% reduction in them ending up in the hospital. And that's key as we know, because people

11:07.200 --> 11:15.040
 end up in the hospital, things don't often go well. We also know that telemedicine, pulse oximetry

11:15.040 --> 11:21.760
 can really help keep track of these people. So when someone has this diagnosis, we know that

11:21.760 --> 11:27.680
 80% and 90% of people can be managed out of the hospital, maybe even a little bit more if we really

11:27.680 --> 11:33.760
 get better access for the monoclonal antibodies out there. And what do we do during that first week?

11:34.640 --> 11:41.440
 The biggest thing is nothing. No antibiotics, no steroids. We can make things worse during that

11:41.440 --> 11:47.280
 first week. We can't really make them better. We want to monitor these people. If you have the

11:47.280 --> 11:52.480
 ability to give them a pulse oximeter, or somehow get them access to a pulse oximeter, if they can

11:52.480 --> 11:58.880
 track, make sure that oxygen saturation stays above 90%, then boom, they hit week to that critical

11:58.880 --> 12:05.280
 week. And then if you have not gotten them access to the monoclonals, or even if you have, then you

12:05.280 --> 12:10.800
 start making that decision about is this someone I can safely manage outpatient. Once you get into

12:10.800 --> 12:19.200
 the second week, if the pulse ox drops below 94%, steroids potentially can play a role. The standard

12:19.200 --> 12:25.920
 would be your dexamethasone, six milligrams, POQ day, times 10 days, prednisone 40 milligrams

12:25.920 --> 12:31.120
 would be an equivalent. And then watch them really closely. Most people are going to do okay.

12:32.240 --> 12:38.880
 Across the board, an aspirin a day is reasonable, but we don't have really clear guidance on the

12:38.880 --> 12:43.280
 best way to protect these people against clots. Your high-risk people will get into this later.

12:43.280 --> 12:50.080
 You might consider other therapies. All right. Right at this point, I'm going to jump into the

12:50.080 --> 12:54.480
 early inflammatory phase. And later on, don't worry, we'll go back and talk about vaccinations,

12:54.480 --> 13:00.080
 active vaccinations. The early inflammatory phase, I started to drift into this with our

13:00.080 --> 13:05.200
 outpatient folks, because remember, and I think this is news to some people, but not to our

13:05.200 --> 13:11.600
 12 listeners, 80 to 90% of patients can be managed outside the hospitals. Some of those

13:11.600 --> 13:16.000
 patients end up in the hospital. You've done all these things. They end up in the hospital.

13:16.000 --> 13:21.520
 What do you do? At the point a person gets admitted, there's a number of labs we currently recommend

13:21.520 --> 13:27.040
 help risk stratify, help manage them. A CBC, a complete blood count with differential,

13:27.040 --> 13:36.640
 a comprehensive metabolic panel, a ferritin, a procalcitonin, a D-dimer, a PTPTT. These are

13:36.640 --> 13:43.920
 our coagulation tests, a C-reactive protein, a triponin, and a chest x-ray at an EKG is reasonable.

13:43.920 --> 13:50.640
 We really don't need a lot of CAT scans, but we do need a few bits of critical information.

13:50.640 --> 13:54.720
 Part of that information is going to come from our labs, but part of it's going to come from

13:54.720 --> 14:00.720
 history. I really want to know, can we pinpoint the date of symptom onset? When did this start?

14:00.720 --> 14:06.480
 Because timing matters. What was the date of your first positive COVID test? This is going to help

14:06.480 --> 14:12.640
 us in management. How are you doing with your oxygen level? Are they above or below 90%?

14:12.640 --> 14:18.800
 If it dropped below 90%, how much oxygen is it taking to keep those saturations greater than 90%?

14:18.800 --> 14:24.320
 Is it nasal cannula? Is it venturing a mask? Is it face mask? And we'll get back to that.

14:25.760 --> 14:31.360
 What about how much weight you're carrying? What is your BMI? Is it greater or less than 30? How's

14:31.360 --> 14:37.040
 that kidney function? How is your estimated GFR creatinine clearance? Is it greater than 30?

14:37.040 --> 14:43.200
 What about those LFTs, that AST and ALT? Are they less than five times upper limit of normal?

14:43.200 --> 14:47.040
 This is going to affect what medicines we're going to consider. What is that

14:47.040 --> 14:51.360
 neutrophil lymphocyte ratio that we get from our complete blood count with differential?

14:52.160 --> 14:57.120
 Really nice paper recently showing that that really helps differentiate how people are going to do

14:57.840 --> 15:03.120
 and particularly dynamic tracking this over time. Nice to have that ferretin

15:03.120 --> 15:10.240
 procalcitonin ratio to help us identify that 10% that subset that has a secondary bacterial

15:10.240 --> 15:15.840
 infection. But remember, it is a subset. Are they at increased risk of clotting or bleeding?

15:15.840 --> 15:22.800
 That lets us make decisions. If someone has a prior history of a GI bleed or they had an

15:22.800 --> 15:28.080
 intracranial bleed, you want to be careful with your anticoagulation there. If the person is obese

15:28.080 --> 15:32.960
 and has a prior history of a pulmonary embolism or deep venous thrombosis, that's also going to

15:32.960 --> 15:39.600
 guide us in management. Now first, what not to do? And I'm actually, I know I'm going to step on

15:39.600 --> 15:45.680
 some toes here, but these are our current recommendations. There are a number of things we are recommending

15:45.680 --> 15:56.400
 not to give to people. Avoid unnecessary antibiotics or antimalarials. No HCQ, no dioxocycline, no azithromycin.

15:57.280 --> 16:01.680
 We do recommend limiting the use of convalescent plasma. There's no compelling benefit there.

16:01.680 --> 16:08.160
 It's a very resource intensive item. And the monoclonal antibody is really the modern convalescent

16:08.160 --> 16:13.200
 plasma. It's got everything we want, but not all the clotting factors. And as we've really learned,

16:13.200 --> 16:18.080
 I think from all this timing matters. Once the person ends up in the hospital, you've missed your

16:18.080 --> 16:26.880
 window. There's really a defined window. Anticoagulation, it's a really, we're learning here. Some people

16:26.880 --> 16:32.640
 are actually doing some, they call them improve scores, really trying to risk stratify to make

16:32.640 --> 16:39.120
 this a little bit more sophisticated. But in general, I'll say prophylactic dose anticoagulation

16:39.120 --> 16:46.480
 is recommended over intermediate or full dose, except on a case-by-case basis. When, as we say,

16:46.480 --> 16:52.160
 one might escalate to full therapeutic dosing if the clotting risk is elevated and the bleeding

16:52.160 --> 16:57.920
 risk is low. And what does that mean? And here we get into the weeds a little. When we talk about

16:57.920 --> 17:05.680
 low molecular weight heparin, prophylactic dosing is anoxoperin, 40 milligrams, sub-Q once a day.

17:06.240 --> 17:10.800
 The person is over a certain body weight, over a certain BMI. We talked about that earlier.

17:10.800 --> 17:19.200
 That might be up to BID. But in a normal BMI individual, the intermediate dosing that comes

17:19.200 --> 17:24.160
 partly out of, I'll say, the OBGYN literature, the 40 milligrams twice a day, that's intermediate

17:24.160 --> 17:30.480
 dosing that's not recommended. And in some cases, as mentioned, we might do full dose, which would be

17:30.480 --> 17:37.840
 the milligram per kilogram twice a day. For the obese patients, that BMI greater than 30,

17:37.840 --> 17:42.320
 as mentioned, you're going up to BID. That's not intermediate. That's prophylactic dosing

17:42.320 --> 17:48.160
 adjusted for body weight, for your dialysis patients. So you need to know that renal function if it's

17:48.160 --> 17:55.040
 less than 50, 15, or they're on dialysis, then we actually consider using heparin with concerns

17:55.040 --> 17:59.840
 about accumulation of metabolites with the low molecular weight heparin. And when we do the heparin,

17:59.840 --> 18:07.680
 it's 5,000 units, sub-Q, and that's going to be every eight or 12 hours. Certain circumstances,

18:07.680 --> 18:12.560
 we might use our direct acting anticoagulants. These are people may be familiar with the

18:12.560 --> 18:19.840
 zorelto or the eliquest, the 10 milligrams once a day, the eliquest 2.5 milligrams twice a day.

18:20.560 --> 18:26.480
 Again, these things are adjusted based upon renal function and other factors. And in some cases,

18:26.480 --> 18:32.480
 people are just using the baby aspirin, 81 milligrams POQ day, sometimes just based upon

18:32.480 --> 18:37.440
 an overall clinical picture. But some people are actually, as I mentioned, calculating the

18:37.440 --> 18:46.160
 improve, so the international medical prevention registry on venous thromboembolism scores. And

18:46.160 --> 18:52.240
 then using these and asking questions about was there a previous clot, issues with paralysis,

18:52.240 --> 18:58.000
 cancer, are you in the ICU? Is there complete immobilization? Is your age over 60? And then

18:58.000 --> 19:03.120
 trying to weigh that against, you know, is there an issue of an ulcer bleeding in the last three

19:03.120 --> 19:07.920
 months? Are the platelets less than 50, right? You're going to want to know about that. Are

19:07.920 --> 19:14.480
 there issues with the liver? Are there central venous catheter? So this is all getting a little

19:14.480 --> 19:20.800
 bit sophisticated. We're learning a little bit more. As we well know, people who are severely ill

19:20.800 --> 19:26.640
 with COVID, maybe 30% of them will have significant clots. But if you put them all on full dose

19:26.640 --> 19:31.840
 anticoagulation, you might have bleeds in about 8%. So you got to balance this, right? We're not

19:31.840 --> 19:37.360
 saying that full dose anticoagulation doesn't prevent the clots. But you may end up with a net

19:38.320 --> 19:43.440
 negative mortality. If you go with full dose on everyone, and that's actually come out of some

19:43.440 --> 19:49.760
 recent data, which have actually removed in the ICU arms, people from looking at full dose.

19:49.760 --> 19:54.080
 We don't know if that applies to people in the general hospital wards, but we are learning,

19:54.080 --> 20:01.040
 and this stuff is being studied, I'm going to say finally. Immune modulation, steroids,

20:01.040 --> 20:06.800
 recommended only after the first week. So remember, it's not COVID steroids. It's COVID,

20:06.800 --> 20:12.800
 second week, hypoxemia, then you consider steroids. And again, you balance it. You want to look at

20:12.800 --> 20:20.560
 the whole picture in a frail, elderly individual. You might consider lower doses. You might consider

20:20.560 --> 20:26.640
 shorter courses in someone who is more severely ill, maybe carrying more weight. You might consider

20:26.640 --> 20:32.240
 a slightly higher dose. And then that 10 days, you're going to use clinical judgment. We talk

20:32.240 --> 20:38.560
 about dexamethasone 6 milligrams, whether it's IV or PO. If they're taken oral medicines,

20:38.560 --> 20:44.240
 make it oral. There's no reason to add more IV medications, and prednisone 40 milligrams

20:44.240 --> 20:48.160
 would be an equivalent. So some degree of flexibility on doses and duration.

20:49.200 --> 20:53.760
 What happened to anakinra, the IL-1 inhibition? What happened to serilla mab,

20:53.760 --> 21:02.720
 cetuximab, telosilizimab, all our IL-6 blockade? You know, I have to say, we're still waiting to

21:02.720 --> 21:09.040
 see any clear compelling mortality benefit here. The literature sort of bore out what we saw

21:09.040 --> 21:14.400
 early on. If you give, and I'll say, toselizimab, in the absence of steroids, people initially get

21:14.400 --> 21:21.920
 better. But then by 28 days, the mortality is the same. So limited use here. We look at this as

21:21.920 --> 21:27.200
 somebody is heading towards a ventilator. Maybe this will be something that temporarily decreases

21:27.200 --> 21:33.520
 their oxygen requirements. But unfortunately, we're not really seeing, say, sort of the early

21:33.520 --> 21:40.000
 the early optimism panned out. Something is going on with IL-6 that impact on fevers and

21:40.000 --> 21:46.080
 hypoxemia in response to IL-6 receptor blockade is interesting. We're still waiting for better

21:46.080 --> 21:53.120
 guidance here. Hypoxemia management. How do we keep that oxygen above 90? And I have to say,

21:53.120 --> 21:57.280
 this is a huge area. This is why people need to be in the hospital by and large.

21:59.200 --> 22:04.160
 The goal is to keep those sets 88, 90% or higher. You don't really need to crank

22:04.160 --> 22:09.760
 them much above that. This gets very sophisticated. And this is actually where our respiratory

22:09.760 --> 22:16.160
 colleagues get involved. You start with nasal cannula. Two liters, four liters, you might get up to

22:16.160 --> 22:21.120
 eight liters, then escalates to something called a venturi mask, not available in all centers,

22:21.120 --> 22:27.360
 but allows us to actually titrate oxygen saturations a little bit. Then we go up to non-rebreather,

22:27.360 --> 22:34.640
 high flow nasal cannula, things non-invasive ventilatory methods like BIPAP, pruning. We have

22:34.640 --> 22:40.000
 good evidence that that makes a difference, even a mortality benefit, because it's helping us keep

22:40.000 --> 22:44.960
 people off the ventilators. This is something even we're doing in the outpatient setting.

22:44.960 --> 22:50.080
 One of my colleagues, Ken, that was on a call with earlier today, was bringing up that this is

22:50.080 --> 22:53.440
 working in the outpatient setting. You've got an individual, you're trying to keep them out of the

22:53.440 --> 22:59.520
 hospital. Maybe they're even on home oxygen. They're laying on their belly. They're sleeping on their

22:59.520 --> 23:05.360
 belly. That actually helps with the ventilation perfusion mismatch. In another note, I'll throw

23:05.360 --> 23:10.320
 out there that probably a lot of us have experienced, but make sure I share this. Often the pulse

23:10.320 --> 23:18.080
 oximeter readings can be inaccurate. If it doesn't make sense to you, consider doing an arterial

23:18.080 --> 23:26.560
 blood gas. Anti-viral therapeutics. Less and less excitement over remdesivir as time goes by,

23:26.560 --> 23:32.080
 I want to be honest. One of the hospitals here has even started to limit the criteria. For a

23:32.080 --> 23:37.360
 while there, anyone who comes in seemed to get remdesivir. It didn't matter if they were hypoxic,

23:37.360 --> 23:41.520
 but now the guidelines were just updated. These were actually, I have to say, nice updated

23:41.520 --> 23:46.400
 guidelines. You actually saw who was involved in the decision-making, very evidence-based guidelines.

23:47.040 --> 23:53.360
 Basically saying remdesivir, if people met the criteria in the one trial that showed benefit,

23:53.360 --> 24:00.080
 so hypoxic within the first 14 days. The kidney function, you had a GFR of greater than 30.

24:00.720 --> 24:06.000
 The LFTs were less than five times upper limit normal. Then it was five days or less. If you

24:06.000 --> 24:10.320
 start the five days and they really are doing better, you don't have to keep them in the hospital

24:10.320 --> 24:17.760
 to keep giving them this medicine. Miscellaneous things. We're still seeing a lot of our patients

24:17.760 --> 24:24.320
 of vitamin C and thiamine and zinc and vitamin D. People did comment last week that I spoke

24:24.320 --> 24:28.320
 about vitamin D for hospitalized patients, but I didn't mention the Spanish study

24:29.600 --> 24:34.880
 effect of calcifidiol therapy and best available therapy versus best available

24:34.880 --> 24:39.920
 therapy on intensive care unit admission and mortality among patients hospitalized with COVID-19,

24:39.920 --> 24:47.600
 a pilot randomized study. I will say, this pilot study did show benefit. There was

24:47.600 --> 24:54.000
 an RCT at a Brazil that failed to show benefit. I'll say, there are studies going forward,

24:54.000 --> 24:59.680
 including the UK-based coronavite trial. I like the name on that, which is actually fully

24:59.680 --> 25:05.520
 enrolled and we'll get data on that unless the pandemic abruptly ends, which it's not doing in

25:05.520 --> 25:11.760
 the UK. We're actually going to get data from that. We'll see. I want to be balanced here.

25:11.760 --> 25:16.960
 One study that says it works. One study that shows it doesn't show effect. I'll be honest

25:16.960 --> 25:22.320
 when I say, as we learn, I'm happy to share that. I'm not weighing on on either side. If a

25:22.320 --> 25:26.960
 patient comes in and their vitamin D deficient and you give them vitamin D, that actually seems

25:26.960 --> 25:31.040
 like it makes a little bit of sense. Is it going to really make a difference? I don't think so.

25:31.040 --> 25:35.040
 I don't know. Maybe it will. I'm just going to basically say, I don't know.

25:36.400 --> 25:43.520
 Again, really limit the use of antibiotics because only about 10% of patients have actual

25:43.520 --> 25:49.440
 bacterial co-infections in the initial presentation. But we go right into the

25:49.440 --> 25:55.040
 secondary infection phase. You get to week two and three. That's when we actually see

25:55.040 --> 25:59.440
 patients start to not do well. They start to require more oxygen. They start to have a change

25:59.440 --> 26:04.800
 in mental status. Maybe the white count goes up. This is when we want to look for not only bacterial

26:05.440 --> 26:11.040
 but fungal infections. We're seeing both. Then this leads right into that multi-inflammatory

26:11.040 --> 26:18.160
 system phase where we see a lot of our clotting issues and we see a number of our other issues.

26:19.440 --> 26:24.480
 There's really no clear division here, but we run into this tail phase and the issue of

26:24.480 --> 26:28.640
 can patients make it out of the hospital. If they are going to make it out of the hospital,

26:28.640 --> 26:34.320
 there's a couple of things I want to say. One is at discharge. We are recommending,

26:34.320 --> 26:42.640
 particularly in our higher risk patients, extended prophylaxis against clots for at least 30 days,

26:42.640 --> 26:46.640
 but then we customize this based upon bleeding risk and risk of clotting.

26:47.600 --> 26:51.680
 Some cases, we're still low molecular weight heparin. We're actually continuing that post

26:51.680 --> 26:56.800
 discharge, particularly our highest risk patients that may be going to skilled nursing facilities.

26:57.600 --> 27:03.680
 A lot of our next level of risk, we're doing the direct acting oral anticoagulants that

27:03.680 --> 27:10.400
 doe acts. There's a relto, the eliquis. As we get to a lower risk, it might just be an aspirin

27:10.400 --> 27:16.400
 once a day. How did these people do? I always come back to the like, we don't want to clap

27:16.400 --> 27:22.560
 these people out and forget them. There was a nice article characterizing long COVID in an

27:22.560 --> 27:29.360
 international cohort, seven months of symptoms and their impact. I was posted on the MedRx

27:29.360 --> 27:36.240
 server, looked at about 4,000 individuals, 50 countries. Only about 8% required hospitalization,

27:36.240 --> 27:41.920
 right? So 90% were outpatient. This is an idea that the outpatients are just fine,

27:41.920 --> 27:46.880
 but I'm going to say this study did not suggest that and I will not suggest that. That's not

27:46.880 --> 27:52.320
 been my experience. The majority of the people here, these are people who are past 28 days and

27:52.320 --> 27:57.920
 still have symptoms. The majority, we're still reporting severe fatigue and cognitive impacts

27:57.920 --> 28:04.560
 greater than six months post diagnosis. This was looking at a survey open to individuals 18 years

28:04.560 --> 28:10.960
 of age and older who experienced symptoms consistent with COVID-19 in order to be able to characterize

28:10.960 --> 28:16.160
 the long COVID symptoms over extended duration. They looked at people and they said, have you had

28:16.160 --> 28:21.200
 symptoms more than 28 days and that's who they were looking at. And the people had to have

28:21.200 --> 28:26.880
 the symptom onset back in December and May. So I'm going to critical question for me,

28:26.880 --> 28:31.520
 is what percent of people who get COVID will go on to have long COVID?

28:32.400 --> 28:37.440
 And there was a nice paper on this, attributes and predictors of long COVID, analysis of

28:38.000 --> 28:42.320
 COVID cases and their symptoms collected by the COVID symptoms study app,

28:43.440 --> 28:49.600
 also posted, and really suggesting about 13% of people will have symptoms that last beyond that

28:49.600 --> 28:54.240
 four weeks that fall into the group that was studied above. So we know a certain percent of

28:54.240 --> 28:59.040
 people end up in the hospital. We know a certain percent of people that die, in our case,

28:59.040 --> 29:05.280
 fatality rate is about 3% right now. But our case morbidity rate, here it's suggesting that

29:05.920 --> 29:11.840
 about 13% of people are continuing to have symptoms past that four weeks. And as we saw,

29:12.400 --> 29:17.200
 if you look at those individuals out at six months, the majority of them are having cognitive,

29:17.200 --> 29:23.040
 they're having fatigue issues. So just to close on this here, in the US right now,

29:23.040 --> 29:30.560
 about 12 million cases, we have an outcome for 12 million cases with 3% mortality,

29:30.560 --> 29:35.840
 worldwide 60 million cases. Again, about 2 million deaths, these are where we actually have an

29:35.840 --> 29:42.000
 outcome. The case fatality rate in the world is about 3%. So that's pretty significant.

29:42.000 --> 29:48.320
 And the morbidity, we know that a lot of people that don't die continue to suffer. So I always

29:48.320 --> 29:53.680
 want to keep pointing that out. These people, we need to understand, we need to learn better.

29:53.680 --> 29:58.960
 We're treating it sort of symptomatically, not really having anything fantastic to offer. So

29:58.960 --> 30:04.960
 we need to learn, we need to help these folks. And I will say thank you for everyone that continues

30:04.960 --> 30:10.640
 to listen. Unfortunately, this is still going to be going on for a while. We're still doing our

30:10.640 --> 30:15.520
 fundraising, try to keep the message out, and also continuing to help support the Peace Corps

30:15.520 --> 30:21.040
 with their HIV and AIDS program. So when you get a moment, go to parasiteswithoutboarders.com

30:21.040 --> 30:26.480
 and help us continue our work. All right, our first question is from Christine,

30:26.480 --> 30:34.400
 who wants to know about the high risk groups for vaccination. Dr. Griffin read off a list,

30:34.400 --> 30:40.480
 less 698, that is derived presumably from a CDC document. However, the document actually

30:40.480 --> 30:45.040
 divides that risk people into two groups. Those who definitely are at risk, those who might be

30:45.040 --> 30:50.800
 at increased risk, the footnote on the CDC page only references the definitely are at risk group.

30:50.800 --> 30:55.600
 So that does that mean everyone else in the might be increased risk is essentially delegated

30:55.600 --> 31:01.520
 to the back of the line in phase two, asking on behalf of my friends with severe asthma,

31:01.520 --> 31:07.120
 my friends with type 1 diabetes, my friends with autoimmune diseases or MS taking immunosuppressants

31:07.120 --> 31:11.840
 and myself, a healthcare worker who has been on medical leave for several months and not getting

31:11.840 --> 31:17.120
 vaccinated with my colleagues, and will likely be resigning until I can better manage my condition

31:17.120 --> 31:23.600
 of POTS, a form of disodenomia, rather than a cardiac condition. So I'm assuming I might

31:23.600 --> 31:29.040
 only fall into an increased risk category because of my chronic flu drug cortisone use rather than

31:29.040 --> 31:35.040
 the cardiac medication. I also take to manage my POTS. Any light you can shed on that.

31:35.680 --> 31:41.360
 Yeah, you know, I have to say, let's be honest, the whole rollout of the vaccines is a bit of a

31:41.360 --> 31:46.800
 disaster. And I think this is where this gets like when when will different groups get access to

31:46.800 --> 31:51.600
 vaccine? You know, when we look across the country, there was a goal that by the end of this month,

31:51.600 --> 31:56.560
 there would be 20 million people vaccinated and maybe it's one or two. So you're saying,

31:56.560 --> 32:00.960
 my gosh, look at all these vaccines. And you know, and who's to blame, right? I mean, I think a lot

32:00.960 --> 32:06.480
 of people have been asking that. The vaccines have been delivered to the states. The vaccines

32:06.480 --> 32:10.960
 are sitting in fridges and freezers until those vaccines end up in arms. They're not doing

32:10.960 --> 32:18.960
 anyone any benefit. And sort of more directly your question, the hierarchy of who gets it when

32:18.960 --> 32:23.040
 keeps changing, right? So initially it was going to be the one a prime, we're going to do all the

32:23.040 --> 32:27.760
 ER the ICU, then we're going to get long term care facility and the rest of the health care

32:27.760 --> 32:31.440
 providers. And now a number of the states have just broken ranks and said, you know what,

32:31.440 --> 32:36.960
 we're just doing everyone over a certain age. And it seems like a number of other states are

32:36.960 --> 32:43.120
 falling into line. So it is really interesting. I was walking the dogs with my wife, and we're

32:43.120 --> 32:49.120
 talking about there's been all this focus on the ethics of equity. You know, there's 20% of the

32:49.120 --> 32:55.040
 vaccines that are being given and 80% sitting in freezers and fridges. The emphasis, all the

32:55.040 --> 33:00.960
 effort and the energy I think right now has to go to getting people vaccinated so that the line

33:00.960 --> 33:06.640
 moves. You know, it doesn't matter if you're, you know, 10th in line and the line is like moving one

33:06.640 --> 33:12.160
 person per hour. I'd rather be 100th in line at a move at a line that's moving, you know, 100 people

33:12.160 --> 33:18.800
 every 12 minutes. So I really have to say, this will be changing, right, that the CDC guidance on

33:18.800 --> 33:24.400
 who's at risk, who's at might be at increased risk and who gets vaccinated when and what the

33:24.400 --> 33:28.640
 states are doing. And here in the US, the state governors are the ones that are making the ultimate

33:28.640 --> 33:34.160
 decisions on who gets vaccinated when these things are going to keep changing. We hear in New York,

33:34.160 --> 33:39.360
 it may change again. Pretty soon everyone will be in phase one and it really will hopefully be a

33:39.360 --> 33:44.080
 question of just churning people through getting everyone vaccinated because there's lots and lots

33:44.080 --> 33:49.040
 of doses out there. I think a big challenge is getting them in people's arms. So everyone can

33:49.040 --> 33:55.040
 have access to the vaccines as soon as possible. Sarah and Tallahassee wants to know, is it safe

33:55.040 --> 34:00.560
 to vaccinate patients with long COVID long haulers or whatever they are calling us unfortunate souls

34:00.560 --> 34:07.920
 these days? Sarah, that's a great question. And in some sort of insight, because I've been watching

34:07.920 --> 34:12.160
 this for a while, because I have a lot of long COVID patients go ahead and use that terminology

34:12.160 --> 34:18.400
 for the moment keeps changing too. And you know, how have they done with other vaccines? So some

34:18.400 --> 34:25.280
 of them got another vaccines over the last say 10 months now. And done fine. I did have one patient

34:25.280 --> 34:29.040
 that got tetanus shot. They said, gosh, I felt like sort of a relapse there for a while and then

34:29.040 --> 34:34.560
 kind of moved forward. So, you know, I've been doing a lot of vaccinations recently. We just got

34:35.280 --> 34:42.160
 the COVID vaccine supply for the pro health doctors on Tuesday. So immediately we ran out and

34:42.160 --> 34:47.200
 basically by the end of the next day, 90% of those vaccines that had arrived were in people's arms.

34:47.200 --> 34:53.440
 And and I did over 80 myself. And I would talk to people as I was doing this. And some of these

34:53.440 --> 35:00.240
 individuals are are individuals that are long COVID or long haulers. And I basically would say,

35:00.240 --> 35:05.200
 you got to let me know I want feedback. I want to hear like now we vaccinated over a million people.

35:05.200 --> 35:08.720
 I want to start getting feedback from how did these individuals do they were they were not

35:08.720 --> 35:12.880
 studied. This was not part of any of the data that was discussed under the EUA reviews.

35:12.880 --> 35:19.760
 So, as I get this data, I'm very excited to to share this and let people know. But when they

35:19.760 --> 35:24.320
 ask, they say, should I get vaccinated? I say, my gosh, look at how how you did with COVID the first

35:24.320 --> 35:30.000
 time. Do you want to risk getting at a second time? And so I'm encouraging these individuals to get

35:30.000 --> 35:35.680
 vaccinated. And we'll see what what the impact is. But at least, you know, so far, right, we've

35:35.680 --> 35:40.480
 been doing a lot of health care providers here in the state so far haven't gotten any negative

35:40.480 --> 35:44.800
 feedback from the long haulers. But boy, if there there's issues, I want to hear. So let me know.

35:46.480 --> 35:53.040
 Our last letter for 2020 is from Sue Ellen, who Daniel may remember from

35:53.040 --> 35:58.880
 Twipp, Sue Ellen from Roswell, Georgia. I was talking to some friends yesterday discussing COVID

35:58.880 --> 36:03.840
 vaccines. One friend says she will not get it does not even get flu vaccine because she's immune

36:03.840 --> 36:08.960
 compromised. She has some hereditary disorder that caused her to have her spleen removed.

36:08.960 --> 36:13.280
 I have at least two other friends I know who are missing their spleens. Well, whether they

36:13.280 --> 36:18.000
 miss them or not, I can't say, but they have had them removed. My question is, what is the impact

36:18.000 --> 36:23.280
 of having no spleen with regard to both COVID and the vaccine? Sounds like one of those prisoners

36:23.280 --> 36:28.000
 dilemma type logic problems. If you don't have a spleen, I would think you're immune compromised,

36:28.000 --> 36:32.080
 which should make you more liable to get severe COVID. So that should mean you should get the

36:32.080 --> 36:36.480
 vaccine. But according to my French, you can't even get the flu vaccine because of her immune

36:36.480 --> 36:41.120
 compromised status. So she figures that COVID vaccine is not for her either. You must have

36:41.120 --> 36:45.440
 patients who have had their spleen's removed. So what is your recommendation with regard to the

36:45.440 --> 36:52.800
 vaccine? Yeah, this I have to say this is a very interesting email and the whole issue about not

36:52.800 --> 36:58.640
 having a spleen. I have to say we consider these individuals who have spleen to be at higher risk

36:58.640 --> 37:05.680
 of bad outcomes with infections, particularly with pathogens that it's a polysaccharide type

37:05.680 --> 37:12.080
 response. So we worry about encapsulated organisms. So we're about homophilus, influenza, pneumococcus,

37:12.080 --> 37:18.560
 and such. So actually, we usually are sticklers, I would say, for getting these individuals vaccinated.

37:18.560 --> 37:23.040
 So I'm not sure why she would be under the impression not. So I'm going to say,

37:23.840 --> 37:31.280
 if you have no spleen, there is a site, there's a CDC, a splenia vaccine site where it basically

37:31.280 --> 37:36.880
 goes through and it gives you a list of a dozen vaccines that are really critical. There's even

37:36.880 --> 37:43.440
 a American Society of Hematology statement position on what to do with the mRNA vaccines,

37:43.440 --> 37:50.960
 if you have no spleen, and we encourage and they encourage people without a spleen to get the mRNA

37:50.960 --> 37:56.560
 vaccine. There's some concern that maybe you will not have as robust a response, but it's only

37:56.560 --> 38:01.760
 theoretical. There's no downside. The only concern is maybe you will respond as well. But let's

38:01.760 --> 38:06.080
 think about what's the issue with the spleen. The spleen is an area where you can have a lot

38:06.080 --> 38:09.920
 of germanol centers, a lot of maturation of B cells, make a lot of really good antibodies.

38:10.800 --> 38:15.360
 There are germanol centers in other places. So I'm going to say that I would recommend

38:15.920 --> 38:21.440
 Sue Allen. Nice to get your remember you well from Twib. But I would recommend actually going

38:21.440 --> 38:25.840
 ahead and getting that vaccine. I would say this is an individual who is at more at risk and

38:25.840 --> 38:32.800
 would potentially get benefit. Well, that is our COVID-19 clinical update number 43 with Dr.

38:32.800 --> 38:39.040
 Daniel Griffin. Daniel, it has been a privilege to have you join Twib this past year. Thanks so

38:39.040 --> 38:44.960
 much and happy new year. Oh, thank you as well. It's been great. I love the opportunity to share

38:44.960 --> 38:51.280
 this information. I hope everyone else enjoys it. And look forward to more updates next year.

38:51.280 --> 38:56.000
 And I'll just I'll close on a little bit of good news. I just found out today that now with the

38:56.000 --> 39:01.840
 excitement of CT values, I can get CT values on Long Island as well as at Columbia. So

39:01.840 --> 39:23.200
 hopefully I'll have some clinical experience to share with everyone in the future.
