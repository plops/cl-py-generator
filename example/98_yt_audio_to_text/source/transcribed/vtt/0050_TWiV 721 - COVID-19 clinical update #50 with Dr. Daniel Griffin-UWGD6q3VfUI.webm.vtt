 This week in virology, the podcast about viruses, the kind that make you sick.

00:10.400 --> 00:19.920
 From Microbe TV, this is Twiv, this week in virology, episode 721, recorded on February 18,

00:19.920 --> 00:26.640
 2021. I'm Vincent Racken Yellow, and you're listening to the podcast All About Viruses,

00:26.640 --> 00:34.880
 joining me today from New York, Daniel Griffin. Hello, everyone. This is our update number 50,

00:34.880 --> 00:40.800
 Daniel, almost a year's worth of updates. How about that? Yeah, that's quite something. Yeah,

00:40.800 --> 00:47.520
 I guess 50 is a important number, but let's march through, let's not make this 50 minutes long.

00:47.520 --> 00:56.960
 So, off with my quotation, in nature, nothing exists alone, and that's by Rachel Carson from

00:56.960 --> 01:03.920
 Silent Spring. I just keep using it, bring people back to the fact that we talk a lot about things

01:03.920 --> 01:11.680
 in the US, but we are part of the global community. And if we don't address this virus at a global

01:11.680 --> 01:17.760
 level, it is not going to go well for anyone. We are part of the world. No walls that are going

01:17.760 --> 01:25.360
 to keep this virus out. My three rules never miss an opportunity to vaccinate, never miss an

01:25.360 --> 01:30.880
 opportunity to test, and never waste a vaccine dose. Still pains me when I hear that doses are

01:30.880 --> 01:35.280
 being thrown in the trash because people are worried they'll be legal consequences.

01:35.280 --> 01:41.520
 So, let's go through our stages. So, the pre-exposure period, there's a lot of coverage on the CDC

01:41.520 --> 01:46.720
 guidance on school openings. You know, the CDC, you can go there. There's a lot to read there.

01:47.280 --> 01:54.080
 Couple criticisms people have is there may be not enough focus on ventilation. But for the first

01:54.080 --> 01:59.200
 time, what I am really seeing is a lot of the school opening plans are introducing testing,

01:59.200 --> 02:03.920
 and it looks like there's federal support for testing, testing saves lives.

02:03.920 --> 02:10.240
 And I know early on a bit of controversy about testing and a period of time when some politicians

02:10.240 --> 02:14.960
 were trying to get people not to test. And I am not talking just about at the federal level,

02:14.960 --> 02:19.360
 but we've moved past that. And I think we all now realize, and this has embraced,

02:19.360 --> 02:25.440
 testing saves lives. Don't let the testing numbers go down. We need two million tests a day

02:26.080 --> 02:31.280
 to keep making the progress we're making, to keep an eye on what's going on. So, you got to keep

02:31.280 --> 02:37.280
 testing. Active vaccination, a little bit more out of Israel on the impact of vaccination on

02:37.280 --> 02:42.400
 viral load. And I think this is a little bit better than the data that I discussed last week.

02:42.400 --> 02:47.920
 I was not impressed with a single CT value change. But this was posted as a pre-print,

02:47.920 --> 02:54.080
 decreased SARS-CoV-2 viral load following vaccination. So, it reminds me when I say that.

02:54.080 --> 02:57.280
 And Vincent, maybe you remember, we had a big discussion. Are we going to ever discuss

02:57.280 --> 03:02.400
 preprints? Are we going to wait until things hit the peer review? And I guess we embraced,

03:02.400 --> 03:09.600
 we will be pre-print reviewers and discuss the data critically. But in this study, they looked

03:09.600 --> 03:16.720
 at CT values of positive samples collected 12 to 28 days after vaccination. And they compared

03:16.720 --> 03:22.320
 these to CT values of positive samples taking during the first 11 days following vaccination.

03:22.320 --> 03:29.760
 So, I felt this was apples to apples. And they reported the differences in mean CT values calculated

03:29.760 --> 03:36.400
 for these two time periods. Basically, looked at three different, so they looked at RDRP,

03:36.400 --> 03:43.840
 right? That's the RNA dependent RNA preliminase gene. They looked at the gene E, they looked at

03:43.840 --> 03:49.360
 gene. But just to give you a sense, they were seeing here about a two CT value difference.

03:49.360 --> 03:55.840
 So, decreased from about, or I guess the CT value is increasing, the viral load is decreasing.

03:55.840 --> 04:01.520
 So, I got to keep that in mind here. So, the CT value was increasing by about two from 25

04:01.520 --> 04:07.760
 up to about 27. So, we're looking at an RNA copy number going from about 1.5 million

04:07.760 --> 04:13.760
 down to about 400,000. So, that's going in the right direction. We're trying to build a case,

04:13.760 --> 04:19.280
 and I'm sure this will come up at the end about if you've been vaccinated, are you less like

04:19.280 --> 04:24.800
 to carry a high level of virus and transmit it to others? And I think the data is starting to

04:24.800 --> 04:30.560
 support that story. The period of detectable viral replication, I get a lot of people saying,

04:30.560 --> 04:35.360
 well, Dan, where are the antivirals? And I want to say this is an excellent question.

04:35.920 --> 04:40.960
 We really just have, as far as what we think of small molecules remdesivir, weak evidence,

04:40.960 --> 04:47.360
 minimal impact, maybe shortens our hospital stay by a few days, no compelling mortality data there.

04:47.360 --> 04:53.520
 But monoclonals, growing amounts of data and evidence there suggesting that there's even a

04:53.520 --> 04:59.280
 mortality benefit as well. There is convalescent plasma, but remember the compelling data there

04:59.280 --> 05:05.120
 was on high titer used within the first 72 hours. Had a discussion today at our hospitals. A lot

05:05.120 --> 05:10.080
 of the centers around the country don't titer their convalescent plasma. By the time someone

05:10.080 --> 05:14.640
 shows up in the hospital, they're usually past those first 72 hours. And when you compare apples

05:14.640 --> 05:18.800
 to apples here, if you have a choice to drink convalescent plasma and monoclonals, the data

05:18.800 --> 05:25.680
 is more compelling on monoclonals. So right now, our best antiviral therapeutic is monoclonals.

05:26.240 --> 05:30.720
 But don't miss your window. This is a numbers game. Don't say, oh, you look like you're doing

05:30.720 --> 05:36.560
 well. Let's wait. If you wait, you can miss your window. And one of the nice little bits of news

05:36.560 --> 05:41.440
 here is we just got approval that we're going to be able to start offering monoclonal therapy

05:41.440 --> 05:47.120
 at our urgent care centers throughout the New York tri-state area. So improving access,

05:47.760 --> 05:51.280
 we're going to have the ability through the Catholics to get it in the ERs, through the

05:51.280 --> 05:57.120
 Northwell system to get it in the tents, through the Pro Health, Riverside, and Pro Health Connecticut

05:57.120 --> 06:01.920
 to get urgent care centers. And through United and Research, we're going to keep doing in-home

06:01.920 --> 06:08.560
 infusions and down to 16 minutes per the FDA. I know folks are still taking an hour to get it

06:08.560 --> 06:13.840
 in there, but we have approval now for 16 minutes. Early inflammatory phase, there was another

06:13.840 --> 06:18.080
 interesting paper put up on the Lancet as a preprint. I actually think this is interesting. This

06:18.080 --> 06:25.200
 is a paper that I've already seen is changing people's practice. And this was a vitamin D paper,

06:25.200 --> 06:32.080
 yes, calcifidile treatment and COVID-19 related outcomes by a group in Barcelona. And this followed

06:32.080 --> 06:39.040
 on that pilot study that I discussed on October 4th on that TWIV. So they had done a pilot study.

06:39.040 --> 06:44.960
 Now this was the prospective open label randomized control trial. They had under 1,000, just under

06:44.960 --> 06:51.840
 1,930 participants. And they were randomized to either receive oral calcifidile treatment.

06:52.560 --> 07:01.520
 That was 532 micrograms on day one, 266 on day three, 71530. And they started this right at the

07:01.520 --> 07:06.880
 time of hospital admission. And then the controls were not receiving this. So I sort of jokingly

07:06.880 --> 07:11.600
 said, you know, I think in the past that nobody's going to do a study with a vitamin D deficient

07:11.600 --> 07:16.640
 control arm, but apparently they do that in Spain. And in the intention to treat analysis,

07:17.520 --> 07:25.360
 6.5% of the folks treated with vitamin D died compared to 15% in the control arm, giving us a

07:25.360 --> 07:33.360
 p value of 0.001. So the adjusted results actually showed a reduced mortality about 60%.

07:34.240 --> 07:41.120
 So relative risk 0.40. So what we're starting to see, at least in hospitalized patients,

07:41.120 --> 07:45.440
 if people were not listening to me and fouching a few others, and they're not taking their vitamin

07:45.440 --> 07:51.600
 D and showing up deficient, a lot of folks are actually starting vitamin D when they get admitted.

07:51.600 --> 07:58.240
 But just a few basics here, just to remind people, this study looked at calcifidile

07:58.880 --> 08:04.800
 treatment. But a lot of us in the US are using ergo calciferal and coli calciferal, right? So the

08:04.800 --> 08:10.320
 coli calciferal is that vitamin D3 that we're taking 1,000, 2,000 different recommended

08:10.320 --> 08:18.000
 doses per day. The ergo calciferal is our vitamin D2 that is often weekly. So our D3,

08:18.000 --> 08:24.560
 usually animal origin, so oily fish, egg yolks, meat, your ergo calciferal is going to be from

08:24.560 --> 08:31.120
 certain vegetables. And so things get a little bit complicated for us here because we don't

08:31.120 --> 08:35.680
 quite have the same formulation used in the study. So a lot of us here in the US are just

08:35.680 --> 08:41.760
 using the vitamin D3, the coli calciferal, 4,000 I use per day. But I do want to point out check

08:41.760 --> 08:47.280
 those vitamin D levels. I had a patient today, maybe he listens to much Twiv. His vitamin D level

08:47.280 --> 08:55.280
 was 138 at admission. Normal would be less than 80, sort of a 30 to 80 range. 138, that's too high.

08:55.280 --> 09:00.240
 So he and I actually had to have a talk about not taking so much vitamin D. I'll say in some of

09:00.240 --> 09:05.280
 the hospitals, it's been fairly standard to give people vitamin D, sort of a thought maybe a benefit,

09:05.280 --> 09:09.920
 no significant concern for harm. Some of the hospitals though, this is new. All right,

09:09.920 --> 09:18.400
 we had another study actually on zinc and vitamin C. This was not as positive. This was

09:18.400 --> 09:25.280
 effective high dose zinc and ascorbic acids, that's vitamin C supplementation versus usual care.

09:25.280 --> 09:30.880
 And they were looking on symptom length and reduction among ambulatory patients with SARS-CoV-2

09:30.880 --> 09:36.960
 infection. This was the COVID-A to Z randomized clinical trial, and it was published in JAMA.

09:36.960 --> 09:42.880
 This was only 214 patients. So by the time you break them down, you're looking only about 50

09:42.880 --> 09:50.320
 folks in each group. And they looked at basically the amount of days before they reported a 50%

09:50.320 --> 09:56.880
 reduction in symptoms. So usual care, they're saying about 4.4. The folks who got just zinc

09:56.880 --> 10:04.320
 said 4.9, vitamin C, 3.7, the group that got vitamin C and zinc, 3.4, a lot of overlap here.

10:04.320 --> 10:09.920
 So no real compelling difference. I mentioned this as a small study. And there was the issue

10:09.920 --> 10:16.400
 that the folks who got zinc were reporting metallic taste, dry mouth, gastrointestinal

10:16.400 --> 10:21.920
 intolerance. So the people in the vitamin C group actually, there was differences in the

10:21.920 --> 10:27.440
 amount of nausea, diarrhea, stomach cramps. So small groups doesn't sort of compel us in any way,

10:27.440 --> 10:33.440
 more information there. Another paper on anticoagulation. But here was really the focus. And I think

10:33.440 --> 10:39.920
 this is an important paper. It was demonstrating a mortality benefit to doing anticoagulation versus

10:39.920 --> 10:45.520
 not. Maybe this reminds people of the COVID wars that we discussed about, where we were seeing

10:45.520 --> 10:51.680
 about 30% of the folks not in anticoagulation having major events. So there was a tendency to

10:51.680 --> 10:56.080
 want to use at least prophylactic and a thought of maybe studying prophylactic versus high dose.

10:56.080 --> 11:04.160
 This was actually looking at prophylactic versus none. And there was a 27% decreased risk for 30

11:04.160 --> 11:11.600
 day mortality. So really concluding here that early initiation of anticoagulation compared with

11:11.600 --> 11:17.760
 no anticoagulation was associated with decreased 30 day mortality. They did not see a significant

11:17.760 --> 11:22.240
 increase in the risk of serious bleeding events in this trial. But just to sort of put this in

11:22.240 --> 11:28.560
 the context of our other trials, there's now data to suggest that the optimum dosing for our

11:28.560 --> 11:35.600
 moderate floor patients is going to be full dose, lower risk of bleeding there. In our ICU

11:35.600 --> 11:39.600
 level patients, we're going to back off a little to prophylactic dosing just because we have an

11:39.600 --> 11:44.960
 increased risk of bleeding. This does still leave out a little bit. What do we do with those out

11:44.960 --> 11:48.960
 patients, right? We still don't have as much data as we would like. So that's going to be a lot

11:48.960 --> 11:53.280
 of a judgment call looking at each individual patient. I just want to do a deeper dive into

11:53.280 --> 11:59.360
 the tosyllismab data that I mentioned hot off the press last time. And I want to say this is

11:59.360 --> 12:06.080
 already resulted in the revisions of a lot of hospital guidelines. Tosyllismab has now been

12:06.080 --> 12:13.280
 reintroduced. And this was based upon the recovery data. I'm going to discuss this a bit last time.

12:13.280 --> 12:19.680
 Tosyllismab in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 recovery trial. Preliminary results of a

12:19.680 --> 12:25.600
 randomized controlled open label platform trial. So as I mentioned, last time, this study looked

12:25.600 --> 12:32.720
 at over 4,000 patients. And the tosyllismab was given in a weight-based dosing regimen.

12:33.360 --> 12:38.240
 So if you're greater than 90 kilograms, you're going to get 800 milligrams. If you're between

12:38.240 --> 12:45.440
 65 and 90, it'll be 600 milligrams. 400 milligrams. If your weight is greater than 40 K but less than

12:45.440 --> 12:50.880
 65. And then you drop down to an 8 milligram per kilogram if the weight's less than 40.

12:51.440 --> 12:56.800
 And then a second dose in this study was given 12 to 24 hours later. If in the opinion of the

12:56.800 --> 13:03.360
 attending clinician, the patient's condition had not improved. And here we basically saw that there

13:03.360 --> 13:13.440
 was a 14% reduction in 28 day mortality p value less than 0.007. And about a 20% reduction

13:13.440 --> 13:18.960
 in the risk of being intimated there with a p value of 0.01. So this this builds on the REM

13:18.960 --> 13:24.720
 cap data. But I want to sort of be clear on where this fits in. This isn't everybody gets

13:24.720 --> 13:30.960
 tosyllismab. So this is a background of steroids is critical. We have a lot of studies showing

13:30.960 --> 13:36.880
 that if you give the IL-6 receptor inhibitors without a background of steroids, even in the

13:36.880 --> 13:42.000
 recovery trial, there was a trend towards higher mortality. So you don't want to do that. It also

13:42.000 --> 13:46.880
 looks like the benefit we're seeing here is in the early inflammatory phase, right? We have a lot

13:46.880 --> 13:53.280
 of trials showing that if you give an IL-6 receptor blocker, so a tosyllismab to someone week three

13:53.280 --> 13:58.480
 in that secondary infection, that late phase, that that actually may increase infections,

13:58.480 --> 14:04.000
 not provide benefit. So what we're doing here at a lot of our hospitals, I'll say that Catholic

14:04.000 --> 14:08.320
 health systems actually have been our standard approach for some time. But some of the other

14:08.320 --> 14:14.160
 hospitals, they've they've updated. Basically, if a person comes in, they're on oxygen,

14:14.160 --> 14:18.400
 they've been started on steroids, but now they progressed to a high level of oxygen support,

14:18.400 --> 14:25.200
 then tosyllismab is considered secondary infection phase. Again, I was like to point out the timing

14:25.200 --> 14:30.400
 of that is most people with COVID come in without a secondary bacterial infection. But then a lot

14:30.400 --> 14:35.360
 of folks, we see either they stay in the hospital and then week three, they have this, or they go

14:35.360 --> 14:39.600
 out and they come back and then are differential. One of the things that can drive that readmission

14:39.600 --> 14:47.440
 can be a secondary infection. So finding the ferritin procalcitonin ratio that my buddy Lee Shapiro

14:47.440 --> 14:53.680
 has championed to be quite helpful, fairly predictive. If you take the ferritin divided by procalcitonin,

14:53.680 --> 14:59.120
 numbers less than 844 suggestive of bacterial numbers higher than that, particularly up in the

14:59.120 --> 15:05.760
 thousands suggesting your procalcitonin elevation is being driven by the inflammation are multi-system

15:05.760 --> 15:10.320
 inflammatory phase. Actually, you spend a little time on this because we have a little bit more

15:10.320 --> 15:15.680
 data now. So I want to point out again, there is an early inflammatory phase,

15:15.680 --> 15:21.680
 and then there's this later multi-system inflammatory phase. So there's a bimodal inflammatory nature,

15:21.680 --> 15:27.840
 and either for some folks, this is a readmission. As we saw with children, this may be the first

15:27.840 --> 15:34.960
 time it comes to attention. So an update on the multi-inflammatory syndrome of children. The number

15:34.960 --> 15:41.360
 of cases now reported the CDC is keeping track of this is over 2000, and we've had about 30

15:41.360 --> 15:47.520
 confirmed deaths. So the number of, and this is a little bit of different, the number, or I'll

15:47.520 --> 15:53.840
 say the percentage of the pediatric cases that are now coming in requiring ICU support,

15:53.840 --> 15:59.440
 it used to be about 50%. It's now greater than 80%. So I'm not sure I understand exactly what

15:59.440 --> 16:05.520
 the difference is with the severity there. We also understand a little bit of these 2000 cases.

16:05.520 --> 16:10.800
 The peak of this tends to be in the five to nine year old rage, and there now is a nice case

16:10.800 --> 16:16.320
 definition for the multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children. And the first distinction

16:16.320 --> 16:22.480
 is this is someone under the age of 21. If they're over the age 21, it might be in adults, and we

16:22.480 --> 16:27.040
 see that as well. They have to present with fever, laboratory evidence of inflammation,

16:27.680 --> 16:33.280
 evidence of clinically severe illness requiring the hospitalization with multi-system. So greater

16:33.280 --> 16:38.800
 than two organs being involved. This could be cardiac, renal, respiratory, hematologic,

16:38.800 --> 16:45.120
 gastrointestinal, skin, or neurological, and no alternative explanation.

16:45.120 --> 16:51.680
 And then, ideally, from the case definition, you have positive evidence for either current or

16:51.680 --> 16:57.120
 recent SARS-2 COVID infection. So you could be doing your PCR, serology, antigen tests,

16:57.760 --> 17:02.720
 or a good story of a COVID-19 exposure within the four weeks prior to the onset of symptoms.

17:02.720 --> 17:07.840
 And the CDC now has a nice link where people can go. The tail phase, I want to spend a little bit

17:07.840 --> 17:14.400
 time here, just before we got on the air, Vincent and I were chatting about an individual with

17:14.400 --> 17:21.120
 Wong COVID who had what sounded like a very negative encounter. They went to the emergency room,

17:21.120 --> 17:26.160
 tachycardia, swelling in the legs, continuing to suffer from COVID. And the basically we were

17:26.160 --> 17:33.120
 told, hey, this is what your life is going to be like, get used to it. Not acceptable. There are

17:33.120 --> 17:39.120
 a lot of us, I have to say, who are really keeping an eye on Wong COVID, taking care of a growing

17:39.120 --> 17:46.000
 number of patients. And I have a lot of frustration here. As I mentioned here, we've had a lot of

17:46.000 --> 17:51.360
 research on our vaccines. We've had a lot of research on the care of hospitalized patients

17:51.360 --> 17:56.960
 with COVID. We still don't have robust data to guide us in the outpatient management.

17:56.960 --> 18:01.920
 We don't have robust data to guide us in the care of Wong COVID. There's a lot of centers

18:01.920 --> 18:06.480
 that really are set up by, say, rehabilitation specialists. Basically, let's condition these

18:06.480 --> 18:11.920
 people back up. And, you know, as we know with our experience with other chronic illnesses,

18:11.920 --> 18:16.880
 that's not always acceptable. A lot of people have post-exertional malaise. There's a lot of

18:16.880 --> 18:22.320
 stuff going on here. We're still seeing increased infections in these individuals months and months

18:22.320 --> 18:27.520
 after the acute period. Something's going on here. And a lot of us are really actively trying to

18:27.520 --> 18:33.280
 understand this. So those would be out there listening with with Wong COVID. You're not

18:33.280 --> 18:37.680
 forgotten. We're trying to understand and provide better therapies. And one of the things actually

18:37.680 --> 18:45.280
 we're quite interested in is if you get a vaccine, are you less likely to get long COVID? So some

18:45.280 --> 18:49.280
 people I know who are younger think about the vaccines. And they say, well, I'm not going to

18:49.280 --> 18:54.640
 die of COVID at a very low risk of dying of COVID. But I am worried, you know, I might be in my 20s,

18:54.640 --> 19:00.800
 30s, 40s. If I get COVID, I might end up never better. So we're tracking those individuals. We're

19:00.800 --> 19:05.760
 also tracking ever study fired up on this, where we're looking at people that got the monoclonal

19:05.760 --> 19:10.720
 antibodies. Not only is that going to keep people out of the hospital, but is it going to prevent

19:10.720 --> 19:17.280
 people from developing long COVID? So a lot going on here. And then I will close before we go to

19:17.280 --> 19:23.280
 emails by reminding people to go to parasites without borders and help us support the American

19:23.280 --> 19:28.560
 Society for Tropical Medicine and Hygiene. For the months of February and March, we're going to

19:28.560 --> 19:35.360
 donate a minimum of $20,000, hopefully up to $40,000, matching what people send us to help bring

19:35.360 --> 19:41.680
 some early career investigators, scientists, physicians from less developed parts of the world.

19:41.680 --> 19:46.080
 Women, we're going to be sexist here. We're only going to be helping women. But I think that's

19:46.080 --> 19:54.240
 right. I mean, 15% of the leadership in medicine in global health is made up of women. And that's

19:54.240 --> 19:59.200
 just there's an equity issue there. And we want to jump in. We want to make a difference. So help

19:59.200 --> 20:04.720
 us do that. All right, time for some questions for Daniel. If you have some, send them to Daniel

20:04.720 --> 20:11.680
 at microbe.tv. The first is from Chris. The CDC is now saying, if someone has been fully vaccinated

20:11.680 --> 20:18.240
 two weeks after they do not have to quarantine when directly exposed to someone with COVID. Chris

20:18.240 --> 20:24.480
 wants to visit his infant grandson, neither of his parents are vaccinated. It won't be anytime soon.

20:25.120 --> 20:29.680
 If I have to quarantine before I visit, what is the minimum amount of time to ensure a good

20:29.680 --> 20:35.120
 amount of safety? And Chris has been fully vaccinated. Yeah. So Chris, and I alluded to this a little.

20:35.120 --> 20:40.240
 I mean, the the CDC talked about someone who's been exposed, and then saying, hey, we're going

20:40.240 --> 20:44.480
 to treat people who've been fully vaccinated like someone who had a recent infection with COVID.

20:44.480 --> 20:49.280
 And we're going to, we're going to believe, and they are stepping a little in front of the science,

20:49.280 --> 20:54.720
 but the science is starting to get there, that these individuals are less likely to become infected,

20:54.720 --> 21:02.400
 less likely to transmit. We know about a 95% reduction in symptomatic. We don't quite have a solid data

21:02.400 --> 21:09.280
 on the impact of asymptomatic, but now we're starting to see lower viral loads. So I'm going to

21:09.280 --> 21:13.680
 basically give you the information to make the decision here. I don't think quarantine is going

21:13.680 --> 21:20.560
 to be something you need to do. You want to continue to engage in low risk activity. Just treat this

21:20.560 --> 21:26.080
 as this possibility that you could be exposed, could have low level asymptomatic and not be aware

21:26.080 --> 21:31.840
 of it, or you could have pre-symptomatic, right? It's a 95% reduction, not 100%. And don't forget

21:31.840 --> 21:37.360
 about testing. Testing is still another thing. You know, we talk about the Swiss cheese approach,

21:37.360 --> 21:45.280
 multiple layers, right? So you got your vaccine, you get your test, you look at different exposures

21:45.280 --> 21:51.680
 and how to do things safely. But I think that we need to start basically being honest and not

21:51.680 --> 21:57.600
 underselling the vaccines. And the biggest risk for older individuals was that they would get

21:57.600 --> 22:03.840
 COVID and die. But there's been a tremendous burden, a tremendous social isolation. So that

22:03.840 --> 22:08.240
 would be my advice on this. Vaccination is great, but don't forget about testing.

22:08.240 --> 22:13.040
 All right, Javad writes, as a primary care physician who works both in the clinic and

22:13.040 --> 22:17.200
 hospital and his faculty at both the med school and residency, I'm disappointed at the lack of

22:17.200 --> 22:23.360
 guidance there is for COVID management and primary care. There is clear guidance for how to manage

22:23.360 --> 22:29.040
 COVID patients in the hospital based upon a fair amount of research. There's almost nothing for

22:29.040 --> 22:35.680
 primary care doctors. And Javad goes on to talk about monoclonal antibodies, which are underutilized

22:36.480 --> 22:43.120
 in his system at the University of Minnesota, even though we have far more COVID in the community

22:43.120 --> 22:48.000
 than in the hospital, basic questions of whether to use anti coagulation and or aspirin have not

22:48.000 --> 22:53.760
 been answered. Therapeutics that are logistically more feasible are not known. A small study showed

22:53.760 --> 22:59.760
 fluvoxamine could be a game changer in terms of limiting hospitalization, but a larger study is

22:59.760 --> 23:05.440
 in its early stages. What would you recommend in terms of outpatient management? We are doing a

23:05.440 --> 23:10.240
 lot of testing and monitoring, but it would be nice to have better research and guidance as to

23:10.240 --> 23:15.200
 what more can be done. All right, so Javad, you bring up some excellent points. First off,

23:15.200 --> 23:20.960
 say hello to my buddies there at University of Minnesota. It's a fantastic place, by the way,

23:20.960 --> 23:28.560
 except it's cold. I spent a winter visit there in the end of June once, joking about that.

23:29.360 --> 23:34.560
 But no, you are completely right. What the COVID pandemic has really pointed out to us

23:34.560 --> 23:41.760
 is what a poor system we have for rapidly studying outpatient therapies, right? I mean,

23:41.760 --> 23:46.160
 the monoclonals almost didn't make it to market because they were studying them in week three

23:46.160 --> 23:51.920
 ICU patients, right? We really need to change that. We need a robust ability to study

23:52.640 --> 23:59.040
 outpatient therapeutics and to point out, right, 80, 90% of folks with COVID are managed in the

23:59.040 --> 24:05.280
 outpatient setting. So what do we do? There is limited data. So let me go through what there is.

24:05.280 --> 24:09.040
 First thing, it's diagnosed one of the first things. You mentioned monoclonal antibodies.

24:09.040 --> 24:15.280
 That's critical. If the person qualifies, and hopefully this is going to expand as far as access,

24:15.280 --> 24:21.680
 monoclonal antibodies are a game changer. We do not recommend starting steroids in that first week,

24:22.320 --> 24:25.440
 but I'll tell you, in the New York area, a lot of times when you get to week two,

24:25.440 --> 24:30.800
 when people start to drop their SATs below 94, we're starting steroids in the outpatient setting,

24:30.800 --> 24:35.680
 we're actually doing home oxygen and pulse oximeter. We have actually programs where

24:35.680 --> 24:39.760
 we're managing a large number of patients that in other parts of the country probably are in

24:39.760 --> 24:46.960
 the hospital. What about anticoagulation in that context? Is it aspirin? Are we using things like

24:46.960 --> 24:53.920
 the Eliquis or Zerelto? Can you say brand names there? I apologize. So in some situations, yes,

24:53.920 --> 25:00.560
 we do have some limited data on aspirin, providing a benefit as well. But no, you are totally right

25:00.560 --> 25:07.920
 here. I saw the SSRI study, this the flu boxamine study. And that is very interesting. And where's

25:07.920 --> 25:12.720
 the rest of the data there? Where's the data? I think we've sort of joked about of giving people

25:12.720 --> 25:18.320
 vitamin D and seeing if that keeps people out of the hospital. These are inexpensive therapies

25:18.320 --> 25:23.920
 that we would love to have the answers to. And we don't. It's a year later. So I see all this data

25:23.920 --> 25:28.880
 coming out of the UK. What would we do without the UK? We wouldn't know the benefit of steroids.

25:28.880 --> 25:34.720
 And we would know the benefit of when to use tosy. So yeah, we need to do a better job.

25:34.720 --> 25:41.200
 William writes, is it safe to receive COVID vaccine if you are incubating COVID-19 or ill

25:41.200 --> 25:47.520
 with COVID-19? So William, we don't recommend vaccinating people if they're ill with COVID-19.

25:48.480 --> 25:53.040
 Basically, we're treating them with other therapeutics. We're waiting until they get better. And then

25:54.000 --> 25:58.320
 the CDC is saying there's no minimum time to wait. Like once you get over COVID-19,

25:58.320 --> 26:02.160
 don't miss your opportunity to immunize. If you wait three months, like I know some people

26:02.160 --> 26:05.920
 recommend, I feel like you're missing that opportunity. Again, who knows what that person is feeling

26:05.920 --> 26:10.720
 like in three months? Maybe they don't want to get vaccinated then. You've lost that. But we've

26:10.720 --> 26:15.920
 certainly have seen a lot of folks who come in. They don't get tested. They get their COVID shot

26:15.920 --> 26:23.600
 and they were incubating COVID. And I actually a woman I'm taking care of today. And as I expressed

26:23.600 --> 26:27.360
 to her, most of the patients that I've seen, unfortunately, I've seen a lot of folks,

26:27.360 --> 26:31.360
 where they got their COVID shot three or four days later, they're not feeling well. They're

26:31.360 --> 26:35.680
 thinking, you know, this reactogenicity, it's just a little bit rough. And then they get a test and

26:35.680 --> 26:41.360
 they realize, no, I actually was incubating COVID when I got vaccinated. These people, I have to say,

26:41.360 --> 26:46.720
 tend to do quite well. I don't know if it's that we're giving them a nice boost of the spike protein

26:46.720 --> 26:51.760
 response. But when I'm discussed with colleagues, they've shared similar experiences. So we don't

26:51.760 --> 26:58.000
 intentionally vaccinate people who are incubating COVID. I've actually encouraged a lot of the centers,

26:58.000 --> 27:02.480
 particularly with the high rates that we have of testing people when they come in for vaccines,

27:02.480 --> 27:09.360
 if possible, too many situations where, you know, a group comes in and everyone gets vaccinated.

27:09.360 --> 27:13.840
 And one of those people in the group has COVID. And then they find out a day or two later,

27:13.840 --> 27:18.320
 and then we know everyone there got COVID, you know, riding to and from in the car, right?

27:19.040 --> 27:22.400
 So I'm going to encourage people to continue to test.

27:22.400 --> 27:28.560
 All right, one more, Daniel from Stefan, whose mother has had a long difficult problem with COVID

27:29.520 --> 27:35.600
 starting out on Long Island, in fact, and has taken a long time to recover now is in Florida,

27:35.600 --> 27:41.920
 where the doctors say she can be vaccinated, but he's not sure. She's suffering from PTSD,

27:41.920 --> 27:47.680
 has difficulty breathing. And he wants to know, can she get the mRNA vaccine? Should she wait for

27:47.680 --> 27:54.960
 J and J? She's he's heard about people in Europe, frail seniors in Europe passing away after receiving

27:54.960 --> 28:01.920
 the mRNA vaccine. In Florida, he's worried that she's going to get infected if she's not vaccinated.

28:02.560 --> 28:07.280
 So what do you think, Daniel? Yeah, no, these are excellent questions. And I think you lay it out.

28:07.920 --> 28:15.360
 I've certainly seen some fairly frail, older individuals who, you know, I say the difference

28:15.360 --> 28:20.400
 between, you know, you and me with reactogenicity, maybe whether or not we make it to work with

28:20.400 --> 28:25.360
 some individuals, the reactogenicity, maybe whether or not they, you know, continue to survive,

28:25.360 --> 28:30.640
 right? I mean, a lot of people have significant oxygen requirements. They have pretty severe

28:30.640 --> 28:34.560
 disease. I've actually seen a few people get vaccinated actually end up in the hospital for a

28:34.560 --> 28:39.760
 few days, because the reactogenicity put them below that level. So this is not one of those

28:39.760 --> 28:44.000
 where I just sort of say, Oh, go ahead and have her do it. You want to have a conversation because

28:44.000 --> 28:49.200
 this is a risk benefit here. If she gets a second bout of COVID, and we certainly know people get

28:49.200 --> 28:54.960
 reinfected, it's a question of what percent, right? You know, how is she going to do when you

28:54.960 --> 29:00.240
 describe her getting a second infection? So you want to balance that against the reactogenicity.

29:00.240 --> 29:06.080
 The reactogenicity is a couple days of, you know, and in a person who had had prior COVID,

29:06.640 --> 29:11.120
 pretty significant reactogenicity, probably going to have fever, probably going to feel crummy,

29:11.120 --> 29:17.600
 probably going to have a little bit increased breathing. So yeah, no, this is not a straightforward

29:17.600 --> 29:23.120
 decision. And I think this is one of those reasons why I'm not a huge fan of sort of the convention

29:23.120 --> 29:28.240
 center mass vaccination site. This is an individual ideally, as you are bringing up,

29:28.240 --> 29:33.840
 who has this conversation with her physician, with her family. And then if they're going to be a

29:33.840 --> 29:37.840
 progression to get the vaccinations, this is someone you want to keep an eye on.

29:37.840 --> 29:41.600
 Matthew Hospital, my mother was there recently out in Port Jefferson.

29:41.600 --> 29:42.640
 Yeah, Port Jeff, right.

29:42.640 --> 29:44.000
 I'm sure why you went to Florida.

29:44.000 --> 29:49.840
 That is COVID-19 clinical update number 50 with Dr. Daniel Griffin. Thank you, Daniel.

29:49.840 --> 30:08.160
 Oh, thank you. And everyone, be safe for almost there. Things are getting better.
