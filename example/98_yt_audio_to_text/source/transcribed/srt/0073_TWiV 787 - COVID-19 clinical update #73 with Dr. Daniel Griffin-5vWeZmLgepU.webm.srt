0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:06,880
This week in virology, the podcast about viruses, the kind that make you sick.

2
0:00:10,400 --> 0:00:21,040
From MicrobeTV, this is Twiv, this week in virology. Episode 787, recorded on July 29, 2021.

3
0:00:21,680 --> 0:00:27,680
I'm Vincent Racken-Yellow, and you're listening to the podcast all about viruses. Joining me

4
0:00:27,680 --> 0:00:34,960
today from New York, Daniel Griffin. Hello, everyone. Well, you got the 787, Daniel.

5
0:00:36,160 --> 0:00:41,120
Okay, in the show notes, right? There's a nice picture of a large aircraft.

6
0:00:41,120 --> 0:00:46,960
Have you ever flown one of those 787s? I don't think so. Actually, no, I haven't. I've been on

7
0:00:46,960 --> 0:00:52,720
some of the bigger air buses, but never the 787s. So I flew one. I only flew one once to

8
0:00:52,720 --> 0:00:59,040
Singapore from San Francisco in December 2019, and it's a very comfortable plane, very nice.

9
0:00:59,680 --> 0:01:04,000
You were one of those private little suites, right? I was back in the

10
0:01:04,640 --> 0:01:09,360
coach, but it's an 18-hour flight, so it was a bit rough.

11
0:01:10,240 --> 0:01:13,760
Wow. Yeah, that's a long flight. A long flight. You take a nap and you wake up,

12
0:01:13,760 --> 0:01:18,880
and you say, I must be there, and you got another 16 hours to go. Are you wearing a mask, Daniel?

13
0:01:18,880 --> 0:01:25,440
At the moment, no, but when I, you know, I never stopped wearing masks when I went to the gym,

14
0:01:25,440 --> 0:01:31,440
or when I went to the grocery store or other places, and we're going to be touching on that.

15
0:01:31,440 --> 0:01:39,360
So let's get going. All right, start off with my quotation. I would rather have questions that

16
0:01:39,360 --> 0:01:45,280
can't be answered than answers that can't be questioned. And that's by Richard Feynman,

17
0:01:45,280 --> 0:01:52,160
so anyone who just listened to Twiv, what, 786? Rich Condit. I give him a little credit to Rich

18
0:01:52,160 --> 0:01:58,800
Condit, who I think is also a fan of Richard Feynman. And actually, you know, on some

19
0:01:58,800 --> 0:02:03,760
aside, sometime I'll tell a side story about the connection with Richard Feynman. But

20
0:02:04,640 --> 0:02:10,080
I think that this is what science is about. Science is about asking questions, trying to get

21
0:02:10,080 --> 0:02:16,560
answered. There shouldn't be dogma. People shouldn't be afraid to ask questions, to try to discover

22
0:02:16,560 --> 0:02:22,640
things. Actually, just talking to Dixon de Pomeier earlier today, and I sang a little bit of a rise

23
0:02:22,640 --> 0:02:30,160
in the hate mail I've been receiving recently. I did an article in the Washington Post where I,

24
0:02:30,160 --> 0:02:35,440
you know, bemoan that we didn't have better therapies. And of course, I got lots of emails

25
0:02:35,440 --> 0:02:40,800
about what are you talking about, Dr. Griffin, you know, and then all the less than pleasant

26
0:02:40,800 --> 0:02:46,960
adjectives, crimes against humanity, other things in all caps about, you know, if only everyone in

27
0:02:46,960 --> 0:02:54,880
the world had access to Ivermectin and HCQ, we would all be fine. So we'll touch and don't worry,

28
0:02:54,880 --> 0:02:59,360
I'll make sure I mention Ivermectin, you know, won't let an episode go by without that. But

29
0:02:59,360 --> 0:03:05,600
what is the big thing that happened this week? The CDC updated their guidance,

30
0:03:06,160 --> 0:03:12,960
and boy, did this really get a lot of people confused, angry. So let's spend a little time

31
0:03:12,960 --> 0:03:19,040
going through that. What exactly did they say? What did they post? And then we'll speculate or

32
0:03:19,040 --> 0:03:26,000
discuss a little bit on what is behind this. So I actually thought this was pretty reasonable

33
0:03:26,000 --> 0:03:31,120
on the surface. I feel like this should have been something that came out before they dropped

34
0:03:31,120 --> 0:03:35,360
the mass mandate just to give a little context about like public health, because that's really

35
0:03:35,360 --> 0:03:44,960
what this is. And what the CDC said posted until vaccination coverage is high and community transmission

36
0:03:44,960 --> 0:03:51,520
is low, public health practitioners, as well as schools, businesses, institutions, organizations

37
0:03:51,520 --> 0:03:57,200
need to regularly assess the need for preventive strategies to avoid stress and stressing health

38
0:03:57,200 --> 0:04:04,800
care capacity, and imperiling adequate care for both COVID-19 and other non-COVID-19

39
0:04:04,800 --> 0:04:12,240
conditions. Right, I mean, that's just sort of reasonable. And then the CDC recommended five

40
0:04:12,240 --> 0:04:20,080
critical factors that should inform local decision making. One, you should keep an eye on the level

41
0:04:20,080 --> 0:04:26,800
of SARS-CoV-2 community transmission. Two, you should keep an eye on your health system capacity.

42
0:04:27,600 --> 0:04:35,360
Three, you need to keep an eye on COVID-19 vaccination coverage. Four, look at capacity

43
0:04:35,360 --> 0:04:42,240
for early detection of increases in COVID-19 cases. And number five, you need to be aware of

44
0:04:42,240 --> 0:04:48,720
which populations are at increased risk for severe outcomes from COVID-19. And I really,

45
0:04:48,720 --> 0:04:53,200
I'm going to sort of, you know, little criticism to the CDC. It would have been nice to have this

46
0:04:53,200 --> 0:04:59,040
out front when they said a little while back that they felt like things were at a level where it was

47
0:04:59,040 --> 0:05:06,240
appropriate to get the masks off. But here's what the CDC went on to say. And this is when

48
0:05:06,240 --> 0:05:14,320
people got upset. Among strategies to prevent COVID-19, CDC recommends all unvaccinated persons

49
0:05:14,320 --> 0:05:22,000
wear masks in public indoor settings. Okay, so far, so good. Based on emerging evidence on the

50
0:05:22,000 --> 0:05:29,520
Delta variant, the CDC also recommends that fully vaccinated persons wear masks in public indoor

51
0:05:29,520 --> 0:05:36,480
settings in areas of substantial or high transmission. Fully vaccinated persons might consider wearing

52
0:05:36,480 --> 0:05:42,320
a mask in public indoor settings regardless of transmission level. Or if they or someone in their

53
0:05:42,320 --> 0:05:47,680
household is immunocompromised, or is it increased risk for severe disease, or if someone in their

54
0:05:47,680 --> 0:05:53,600
household is unvaccinated, including children aged less than 12. Vincent, do you have any thoughts?

55
0:05:54,560 --> 0:06:01,520
So yes, I do. They shouldn't have relaxed the masking back in April, because vaccine coverage

56
0:06:01,520 --> 0:06:08,720
was less than it is now. So I don't see why they have to go back. However, what is it? What

57
0:06:08,720 --> 0:06:15,040
does the Delta variant have to do? Any different from any other variant? I don't see the vaccines

58
0:06:15,040 --> 0:06:22,240
prevent severe diseases you have said with any variant. So why this concern about the Delta

59
0:06:22,240 --> 0:06:28,880
variant? Do they have some data which drives that decision? Yeah, some special super double

60
0:06:28,880 --> 0:06:36,320
secret information. Do you remember back in December when you and I talked about how everyone in the

61
0:06:36,320 --> 0:06:42,480
UK and in December, Boris Johnson decided that we could take December off from the pandemic and

62
0:06:42,480 --> 0:06:46,960
everyone could go to the pubs and the taverns and have a good old time. And then suddenly,

63
0:06:46,960 --> 0:06:53,600
the Alpha variant came along and changed everything. Yeah, I think the variants are becoming a bit

64
0:06:53,600 --> 0:06:59,520
of a scapegoat. You know, we saw a huge surge after July 4th. We saw a lot of people indoors

65
0:07:00,080 --> 0:07:06,160
transmitting. And I think there's a couple things in here that we've talked about, but maybe we

66
0:07:06,160 --> 0:07:12,640
need to reinforce. One is that unvaccinated people can get infected and transmit to others. I think

67
0:07:12,640 --> 0:07:19,040
we all know that the other is vaccinated people can get infected and transmit to others, particularly

68
0:07:19,040 --> 0:07:25,360
symptomatic vaccinated people. And I think we have growing data that the farther we get out from those

69
0:07:25,360 --> 0:07:34,880
jabs, the higher the risk is for people to get mild symptomatic case of COVID-19 despite vaccination

70
0:07:34,880 --> 0:07:41,440
and spread it to others. So I am not sure that throwing the Delta variant in here really tells

71
0:07:41,440 --> 0:07:50,720
us very much. And there is this sort of buzz that there's some PCR data out there, you know, about PCR

72
0:07:50,720 --> 0:07:56,160
levels being similar, RNA amplification levels being similar. And we're going to talk about that

73
0:07:56,160 --> 0:08:00,960
when we get to testing. But I think Vincent and I, you were on this, you and I are on the same page.

74
0:08:00,960 --> 0:08:09,680
You know, what is more significant behavior or a few substitutions in the spike protein?

75
0:08:10,480 --> 0:08:14,880
I think it's behavior. And yeah, dropping the mass mandate was a little bit premature.

76
0:08:15,520 --> 0:08:21,440
But we've got to sort of reinforce that, you know, as my mom was saying about a bulletproof vest,

77
0:08:21,440 --> 0:08:25,120
I don't understand how you think that's going to protect you when your head is sticking out.

78
0:08:25,120 --> 0:08:33,280
So children, COVID and mental health, right? So where there's a lot of concern, right, about

79
0:08:33,280 --> 0:08:40,080
vaccinations and the fact that some of our children are not going to be eligible when the school's

80
0:08:40,080 --> 0:08:48,720
open. And there is significant concern about, you know, what we can do to make those schools

81
0:08:48,720 --> 0:08:56,480
safer. So I'm going to start off by discussing an MMWR, so Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report,

82
0:08:56,480 --> 0:09:04,320
an early release came out. SARS-CoV-2 infections in public school district employees following a

83
0:09:04,320 --> 0:09:11,520
district-wide vaccination program, Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania, March 21 through April 23,

84
0:09:11,520 --> 0:09:18,960
2021. And this is this concept that if the school employees, if teachers are all vaccinated,

85
0:09:18,960 --> 0:09:23,840
does this create a safer environment for the children? You know, will this prevent those

86
0:09:24,400 --> 0:09:28,320
employees' staff from becoming infected, potentially spreading it to the children?

87
0:09:28,320 --> 0:09:33,520
So this addressed that question of whether promoting vaccination among school staff members

88
0:09:34,240 --> 0:09:40,000
could potentially make our schools safer. So the school district of Philadelphia reopened for

89
0:09:40,000 --> 0:09:46,560
in-school instruction the week of March 21, 2021, right? So this is a number of months back,

90
0:09:46,560 --> 0:09:53,120
so we're going to see data from the spring. They required weekly testing for SARS-CoV-2,

91
0:09:53,120 --> 0:09:58,800
the virus that causes COVID-19, for all employees returning to in-school responsibilities.

92
0:09:59,840 --> 0:10:04,080
The resumption of in-school instruction followed a mass vaccination program

93
0:10:04,080 --> 0:10:11,600
using the Pfizer-BioNTech 2-dose mRNA vaccine offered under a partnership between the Philadelphia

94
0:10:11,600 --> 0:10:20,240
Department of Public Health and Children's Hospital of Philadelphia CHOP, to all the 22,808 school

95
0:10:20,240 --> 0:10:26,880
district of Philadelphia employees. Now, the mandatory, this was a mandatory testing program,

96
0:10:26,880 --> 0:10:34,080
provided an opportunity to assess the percentage of positive by-necks now, point-of-care antigen

97
0:10:34,080 --> 0:10:40,640
tests identified among school staff members based upon their self-reported vaccination status.

98
0:10:40,640 --> 0:10:45,280
So we're going to be able to see vaccinated, non-vaccinated, and what happened as far as

99
0:10:45,280 --> 0:10:54,800
positive tests. So they found a 95% reduction in the percentage of positive SARS-CoV-2 test results

100
0:10:54,800 --> 0:11:03,840
among persons who had reported receipt of two doses of the vaccine compared with those who had not

101
0:11:03,840 --> 0:11:10,560
been vaccinated. So they concluded that vaccination of school staff members is an important,

102
0:11:10,560 --> 0:11:16,080
potential, important strategy to maximize the safety of indoor person education of K through 12

103
0:11:16,080 --> 0:11:21,120
students this fall. So I have to say, this is actually pretty interesting, right? This is not

104
0:11:21,120 --> 0:11:26,640
looking at protection against hospitalization or severe disease. This is looking at the vaccine's

105
0:11:26,640 --> 0:11:32,960
ability to prevent people from even testing positive. I'm looking at Vincent, to see if he has a

106
0:11:32,960 --> 0:11:40,640
comment. I think it's kind of contradictory to what we've been hearing lately, right? Out of Israel,

107
0:11:40,640 --> 0:11:46,400
people are getting infected after vaccination. So I think my view is that the further you get

108
0:11:46,400 --> 0:11:51,360
out from the second dose, your antibodies level drop, you're more likely to get infected. This

109
0:11:51,360 --> 0:11:56,480
was probably done early on, and that's why the infection was prevented. But it's a good indicator

110
0:11:56,480 --> 0:12:01,040
that they could vaccinate everybody in schools, right? Yeah, no. And I actually think that's

111
0:12:01,040 --> 0:12:05,520
important. I mean, this is the nice thing I think about the TWIV audience is our TWIV audience.

112
0:12:05,520 --> 0:12:13,120
We are educating up there. We're good with nuance here in this TWIV world. This was, as you point

113
0:12:13,120 --> 0:12:17,120
out, Vincent, this was done right after vaccination. This is people with the really high antibody

114
0:12:17,120 --> 0:12:24,400
levels, mucosal surfaces. This is that window, we'll talk about how long that window is in a

115
0:12:24,400 --> 0:12:30,240
science paper later, where that vaccine not only protects you against severe disease but is giving

116
0:12:30,240 --> 0:12:36,880
you this herd immunity impact, actually blocking infection and transmission. All right, so let's go,

117
0:12:36,880 --> 0:12:44,240
you know, kids, it's something I was just reading today. I read the Texas papers. I don't know if

118
0:12:44,240 --> 0:12:51,680
you read the Houston papers there, the Houston press. But in the Houston press, maybe Rich Condit,

119
0:12:51,680 --> 0:12:56,880
I don't know, he's down there in Austin, maybe Houston is, you know, close enough. But this was

120
0:12:56,880 --> 0:13:03,520
in the Houston press, out of all the kids who show up to Texas children's concern that they may have

121
0:13:03,520 --> 0:13:11,200
COVID, roughly 10% of the children who tested positive required hospitalizations, and roughly

122
0:13:11,200 --> 0:13:16,640
a third of those ended up requiring critical care. Now, this is concerning on the surface,

123
0:13:16,640 --> 0:13:21,520
but what exactly does it mean? I want to make a couple comments. You know, when it does point

124
0:13:21,520 --> 0:13:28,240
out that children can get sick with COVID, children can end up in the hospital. But this is a select

125
0:13:28,240 --> 0:13:33,520
population, right? These are children who are symptomatic. When a child's brought to the hospital,

126
0:13:33,520 --> 0:13:39,200
there's usually an impression by the parent or the provider that this is a child with a more

127
0:13:39,200 --> 0:13:44,960
serious manifestation. Historically, those numbers have been down around 1% or less.

128
0:13:45,840 --> 0:13:50,960
And so we'll just we'll keep an eye on this. I think I would be shocked and frightened and

129
0:13:50,960 --> 0:13:57,360
bewildered if really 10% of children end up requiring hospitalization with COVID. I did not think

130
0:13:57,360 --> 0:14:02,800
SARS-CoV-2 has changed its biology enough to affect that, but we will see. But it is important

131
0:14:02,800 --> 0:14:07,920
to realize that kids can get COVID, kids can end up in the hospital, kids can end up on ventilators,

132
0:14:08,960 --> 0:14:15,920
kids can have adverse impacts. Testing, just sort of a brief reminder or primer,

133
0:14:16,480 --> 0:14:21,600
because we're going to be hearing now about CT values. And I think that's great. The conversation

134
0:14:21,600 --> 0:14:26,880
is getting a little more sophisticated, but you don't want to have just a little bit of knowledge

135
0:14:26,880 --> 0:14:32,800
or enough knowledge to make you dangerous. So let's talk a little bit about the really two

136
0:14:32,800 --> 0:14:39,360
large category of tests that we use. We use PCR or molecular amplification tests.

137
0:14:39,360 --> 0:14:46,720
These amplify RNA and give us RNA copy numbers when we look at that CT value or

138
0:14:46,720 --> 0:14:53,120
cycle threshold. This is a test for RNA. It's not actually a viral load. It does not give us

139
0:14:53,120 --> 0:14:58,400
number of infectious variants. And I think that's really critical, because we're going to talk a

140
0:14:58,400 --> 0:15:06,960
little bit later on, perhaps, about does an RNA copy number in a vaccinated person mean the same

141
0:15:06,960 --> 0:15:13,360
thing as an RNA copy number in a person who is unvaccinated, who is not potentially destroying

142
0:15:13,360 --> 0:15:21,920
or neutralizing those variants. The other test that we use quite often, and hopefully more and more,

143
0:15:21,920 --> 0:15:27,840
is the antigen test that by next now that we talked about, a couple other ones that BD

144
0:15:27,840 --> 0:15:35,440
Veratore, Quidel, Sophia, the antigen tests are not looking for RNA. They are looking for proteins,

145
0:15:35,440 --> 0:15:41,760
and particularly the immunodominant protein, the nucleocapsid proteins. So this requires,

146
0:15:41,760 --> 0:15:47,680
these tests require that that protein is produced and present in sufficient quantities.

147
0:15:47,680 --> 0:15:53,840
Now, we know at the front end of infection, we start to see those antigen tests turn positive

148
0:15:53,840 --> 0:16:01,360
in an unvaccinated person when the RNA copy number gets above 50,000. And then the same sort of number

149
0:16:01,360 --> 0:16:07,520
as it drops off the tail several days later. But remember, those, that information, and we're

150
0:16:07,520 --> 0:16:14,880
going to hit some studies here, come from the unvaccinated viral kinetics. So antigen tests

151
0:16:14,880 --> 0:16:21,680
historically have correlated very well with individuals being infectious. Active vaccination

152
0:16:21,680 --> 0:16:26,960
never missed an opportunity to vaccinate, and vaccination is how this pandemic ends.

153
0:16:27,600 --> 0:16:33,360
So I don't know if people remember or know the Harry Met Sally movie, I don't know Vincent if

154
0:16:33,360 --> 0:16:40,000
that's a favorite of yours. Not a favorite, but I've heard of it. Okay, well, I will recommend

155
0:16:40,000 --> 0:16:46,560
rewatching it. You know, we all need a little break. But this is a movie with Billy Crystal and

156
0:16:46,560 --> 0:16:51,440
Meg Ryan. And there's this restaurant scene where Sally, played by Meg Ryan, is ordering,

157
0:16:51,440 --> 0:16:55,280
and she says to the waiter, waiter, I'll begin with the house salad, but I don't want the regular

158
0:16:55,280 --> 0:16:59,520
dressing. I'll have the balsamic vinegar and oil, but on the side, and then the salmon with

159
0:16:59,520 --> 0:17:04,320
the mustard sauce, but I want the mustard sauce on the side. And I remember as a child thinking,

160
0:17:04,320 --> 0:17:11,440
can you do that? Don't you just take what's on the menu? And I feel like we're seeing with the

161
0:17:11,440 --> 0:17:18,000
COVID vaccines a bit a little bit of what I'll call the Harry Met Sally phenomenon. We have these

162
0:17:18,000 --> 0:17:24,160
well studied vaccines, dosing regimens, but people want to order something not on the well

163
0:17:24,160 --> 0:17:30,560
studied menu. Like maybe I'll just take one of those mRNA vaccine doses. And maybe I want to

164
0:17:30,560 --> 0:17:36,880
sort of change the interval of what's being done or what's being recommended. So we just had this

165
0:17:36,880 --> 0:17:46,480
article, original article, effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines against the B1617.2 Delta variant. So

166
0:17:46,480 --> 0:17:52,560
you get the different nomenclature there in the New England Journal of Medicine. And the authors

167
0:17:52,560 --> 0:17:58,320
used a case control design to estimate the effectiveness of vaccination against symptomatic

168
0:17:58,320 --> 0:18:06,080
disease caused by the Delta variant, comparing this to the alpha variant over the period that the

169
0:18:06,640 --> 0:18:13,280
Delta variant began circulating. So variants were identified with sequencing of the of the S or

170
0:18:13,280 --> 0:18:20,240
the spike gene data on all symptomatic sequence cases in England were used to estimate the proportion

171
0:18:20,240 --> 0:18:26,560
of cases with either variant according to the patient's vaccination status. They found that the

172
0:18:26,560 --> 0:18:32,880
effectiveness of just that one dose was notably lower among persons with the Delta variant,

173
0:18:32,880 --> 0:18:41,280
only 30.7 percent with the alpha variant, 48.7 percent. They report the results were pretty

174
0:18:41,280 --> 0:18:48,480
similar for both vaccines after just that first dose. Now, when you went to two doses of the mRNA,

175
0:18:48,480 --> 0:18:58,240
Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, 93.7 percent with the alpha variant, 88 percent with the Delta variant.

176
0:18:58,240 --> 0:19:06,160
Now, the the Chadox, the AstraZeneca vaccine, the effectiveness of two doses was 74.5 with the

177
0:19:06,160 --> 0:19:11,600
alpha variant, 67 percent with the Delta variant. So I just want to point out, because I know there's

178
0:19:11,600 --> 0:19:16,480
a lot of discussion now about maybe we should wait, maybe we should change the interval for that

179
0:19:16,480 --> 0:19:23,200
second vaccine dose. And I just want to point out that after just that first dose, you're looking at

180
0:19:23,200 --> 0:19:28,880
only about a 30 percent protection against the Delta variant, which is what is circulating. So

181
0:19:28,880 --> 0:19:34,560
do you want to sit around there at 30.7 percent protection, hoping that if you wait a few extra

182
0:19:34,560 --> 0:19:39,040
weeks, you're going to somehow tweak that 88 percent second dose impact a little higher. So

183
0:19:39,040 --> 0:19:46,480
I'm going to say, don't be sally, just go ahead and get that second dose when recommended.

184
0:19:46,480 --> 0:19:52,480
Now, we also have, we still keep having questions about the third dose, the booster dose.

185
0:19:53,520 --> 0:20:01,920
So we had another paper, and this was antibody response after a third dose of the mRNA 1273 SARS

186
0:20:01,920 --> 0:20:08,000
COV-2 vaccine in kidney transplant recipients with minimal serological response to two doses

187
0:20:08,000 --> 0:20:14,080
published in JAMA. So that's the Moderna vaccine, the Moderna mRNA vaccine that we're talking about.

188
0:20:14,800 --> 0:20:18,880
And the findings were very similar to other investigations we've discussed with

189
0:20:18,880 --> 0:20:23,440
low responders getting some increase in antibody responses with a third dose,

190
0:20:24,320 --> 0:20:30,400
and about 49 percent of kidney transplant recipients who did not respond having detectable

191
0:20:30,400 --> 0:20:36,800
antibody levels after two doses did after a third dose in the case of the Moderna mRNA

192
0:20:36,800 --> 0:20:43,120
vaccine. And I will point out they did not assess the T cell responses. Now this ties into what's

193
0:20:43,120 --> 0:20:48,640
happening to these people, are they getting sick? What is sort of the story? So in the journal

194
0:20:48,640 --> 0:20:55,600
Kidney International, unfortunately behind a paywall, the article occurrence of severe COVID-19

195
0:20:55,600 --> 0:21:02,080
in vaccinated transplant patients was published. And here the authors described 55 solid organ

196
0:21:02,080 --> 0:21:09,600
transplant recipients, 52 kidney, three simultaneous kidney pancreas, who went on to develop COVID-19

197
0:21:09,600 --> 0:21:15,760
after receiving two doses of mRNA-based vaccines. So of these 55 patients,

198
0:21:17,040 --> 0:21:23,280
27 percent required hospitalization for oxygen therapy. It's a little bit higher than we would

199
0:21:23,280 --> 0:21:29,520
think in our generalized unvaccinated population, right? Of these six were admitted to the ICU three

200
0:21:29,520 --> 0:21:36,960
ended up dying. They had information on 25 patients with available data on the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies

201
0:21:37,920 --> 0:21:46,320
between the second dose and the onset of the COVID-19 symptoms. 24, so about half, had negative

202
0:21:46,320 --> 0:21:54,080
serology. One was positive but had weak antibodies. So just a little bit of information we're getting

203
0:21:54,080 --> 0:21:59,520
here trying to figure out what to do with this with this group. I will just say, currently,

204
0:22:00,560 --> 0:22:06,400
we have not started to recommend booster or third doses. But just we are studying this,

205
0:22:06,400 --> 0:22:11,360
we're trying to get a sense of what might happen in the future. I'm going to call this next paper

206
0:22:11,360 --> 0:22:18,720
the optimistic one. I think we need a little optimistic paper here. The paper protection afforded

207
0:22:18,720 --> 0:22:29,040
by the BNT-162B2 and mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccines in fully vaccinated cohorts with and without prior

208
0:22:29,040 --> 0:22:34,560
infection. This was posted as a preprint, right? So we get a lot of questions about this. The

209
0:22:34,560 --> 0:22:43,040
authors assessed the effect of prior infection in Qatar, QATAR, where the alpha and beta variants

210
0:22:43,040 --> 0:22:49,680
were dominant during this period of time. And they used two national retrospective matched cohort

211
0:22:49,680 --> 0:22:58,000
studies, one for the Pfizer biotech vaccine, one for the Moderna mRNA vaccine. They reported that

212
0:22:58,000 --> 0:23:03,920
the incident rates of infection among the Pfizer vaccinated persons with and without prior infection

213
0:23:03,920 --> 0:23:12,560
were respectively 1.6 or 11 for 10,000 person weeks. They looked at this in people with the

214
0:23:12,560 --> 0:23:22,320
Moderna vaccine, 1.5 versus 1.83 per 10,000 person weeks. So they actually found that prior

215
0:23:22,320 --> 0:23:29,040
infection enhanced protection of those that received the Pfizer vaccinated, but they really

216
0:23:29,040 --> 0:23:34,160
didn't see a difference here with the Moderna vaccine. It actually saw pretty low rates with

217
0:23:34,160 --> 0:23:40,400
Moderna vaccinated individuals, whether or not they had pre-existing infection. So sort of interesting.

218
0:23:40,400 --> 0:23:48,880
Now, hot off the press, Amy just sent me this. And so I sent her back and said, hey, this is

219
0:23:48,880 --> 0:23:54,560
already on the block to discuss. And this was an article in the journal Science,

220
0:23:55,120 --> 0:24:03,840
Immune Correlates of Protection by mRNA 1273 vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 in non-human primates,

221
0:24:03,840 --> 0:24:09,760
right? So this is the Moderna mRNA vaccine. And I liked it, but I just want to change the title.

222
0:24:10,800 --> 0:24:15,680
If we change the title, I think we're all really good here. This is really immune

223
0:24:15,680 --> 0:24:22,160
correlates of decreased viral replication. And the authors even have a section heading entitled

224
0:24:22,160 --> 0:24:29,760
antibody responses correlate with protection against SARS-CoV-2 replication. And the authors

225
0:24:29,760 --> 0:24:34,800
do demonstrate that the levels of the anti-S antibody and neutralizing activity correlate

226
0:24:34,800 --> 0:24:41,440
with reduction in viral replication in Bronco alveolar lavages. So that's when you put a tube down,

227
0:24:41,440 --> 0:24:47,520
you put in saline, you wash it out, you pull it back out, and nasal swabs following SARS-CoV-2

228
0:24:47,520 --> 0:24:53,520
challenge in vaccinated animals. There's a lot in this paper, but they do also go on to show,

229
0:24:53,520 --> 0:24:59,360
I think this is interesting, that lower antibody levels were needed for reduction of viral replication

230
0:24:59,360 --> 0:25:06,240
down in the lower airways compared to the upper airways. They also report a dose-dependent response.

231
0:25:06,880 --> 0:25:13,040
And this actually correlated with the S-specific T follicular helper cells that activate the B cells

232
0:25:13,040 --> 0:25:20,320
to secrete IgG, and the canonical cytokine IL-2 was also correlated with dose. So I think this

233
0:25:20,320 --> 0:25:25,200
sort of goes with the discussion, Vincent, that you and I were having earlier, that high antibody

234
0:25:25,200 --> 0:25:30,800
levels may have some impact on the ability of the virus to replicate in our airways, particularly

235
0:25:30,800 --> 0:25:37,600
the upper airways. But this is not really a correlate of protection, it's a correlate of

236
0:25:38,320 --> 0:25:44,800
reduction in SARS-CoV-2 replication. It's not a real world thing. We want to know in people

237
0:25:44,800 --> 0:25:51,680
what protects you against severe disease, right? And this doesn't tell us that, unfortunately.

238
0:25:51,680 --> 0:25:58,000
Yeah, I mean, I think it is, and I'll say, it would be great if we had vaccines that had high

239
0:25:58,000 --> 0:26:02,320
degrees of sterilizing immunity. If once you were vaccinated, you could not be infected,

240
0:26:02,320 --> 0:26:08,000
you could not transmit, you would be a dead end if you were exposed. I think that was actually

241
0:26:08,000 --> 0:26:15,360
discussed on 786-12, that we're not even sure how many of those vaccines really are out there,

242
0:26:15,360 --> 0:26:20,880
whether or not the HPV or the measles even do that. But yeah, this is going to be a challenge

243
0:26:20,880 --> 0:26:26,160
if we're looking for, quote-unquote, herd or community immunity, how much can the vaccines

244
0:26:26,160 --> 0:26:31,200
really play a part in that unless you're getting vaccinated every three months or something along

245
0:26:31,200 --> 0:26:36,720
those lines. The period of detectable viral replication, what I like to say is the time for

246
0:26:36,720 --> 0:26:43,280
monitoring and monoclonals, not the time for antibiotics. Remember, this is a virus. We have

247
0:26:43,280 --> 0:26:50,560
anti-virals. No, not so many great choices here in the COVID world. We have anti-bacterial

248
0:26:50,560 --> 0:26:56,960
cells that target bacteria. We have anti-parasitic drugs that target parasites. This is a virus.

249
0:26:56,960 --> 0:27:03,520
So, do we think that antibiotics, anti-bacterial agents will work? Well, a lot of physicians

250
0:27:03,520 --> 0:27:08,000
seem to feel that, a lot of patients feel that, but we have to have another paper that tells us,

251
0:27:08,000 --> 0:27:14,560
yes, water is wet, fire is hot, and this was the Lancet respiratory medicine publication

252
0:27:14,560 --> 0:27:20,960
Doxycycline for community treatment of suspected COVID-19 in people at high risk of adverse outcomes

253
0:27:20,960 --> 0:27:26,480
in the UK. This is the principal study, a randomized controlled open label adaptive

254
0:27:26,480 --> 0:27:33,520
platform trial. So, the background here is that Doxycycline is often used for treating COVID-19

255
0:27:33,520 --> 0:27:38,560
respiratory symptoms in the community, despite an absence of evidence from clinical trials to

256
0:27:38,560 --> 0:27:44,480
support the issues. And there's a lot of hand waving about it interfering with the virus and

257
0:27:44,480 --> 0:27:49,840
in vitro assays and having anti-inflammatory immune modulating effects, et cetera.

258
0:27:50,800 --> 0:27:56,480
So, this data comes from this trial, the principal, and was performed in primary care

259
0:27:56,480 --> 0:28:04,480
centers in the UK. 2,689 participants were enrolled and randomized. And the authors found

260
0:28:04,480 --> 0:28:09,440
that in patients with suspected COVID-19 in the community in the UK, who were at high risk of

261
0:28:09,440 --> 0:28:16,320
adverse outcomes, treatment with Doxycycline was not associated with any clinically meaningful

262
0:28:16,320 --> 0:28:22,080
reductions in time to recovery, hospital admissions, or deaths related to COVID-19,

263
0:28:22,080 --> 0:28:28,720
and should not be used in the routine treatment for COVID-19. The whole comment that there were

264
0:28:28,720 --> 0:28:35,120
780 folks in the Doxycycline group, 978 in the control group. There were five deaths in the

265
0:28:35,120 --> 0:28:41,760
Doxycycline group, only two in control. So, that's like more than double. I do not think

266
0:28:41,760 --> 0:28:47,040
that Doxycycline is something we should be using for COVID-19. The science does not support it.

267
0:28:47,040 --> 0:28:52,880
What do we end up with? An unnecessary intervention and an increase in antibiotic resistance.

268
0:28:52,880 --> 0:28:56,000
The early inflammatory phase, this is when they show up in the hospital,

269
0:28:56,880 --> 0:29:02,800
still not much new here. We're still steroids, tosyllizumab, if they progress to our higher

270
0:29:02,800 --> 0:29:09,200
oxygen need, prophylactic dose anticoagulation in general, adjusted to higher dose in specific

271
0:29:09,200 --> 0:29:16,960
situations. We are still waiting for more therapies, both in the early viral phase as well as this

272
0:29:16,960 --> 0:29:22,800
phase. We're hearing it may not be until October and November before we get small molecule inhibitors

273
0:29:22,800 --> 0:29:28,960
specifically targeting SARS-CoV-2. So, we're still in July, so we still have a little bit more time

274
0:29:28,960 --> 0:29:36,400
to go. All right, and to the end, the tail phase, the long COVID or the post-cute COVID phase.

275
0:29:37,520 --> 0:29:43,600
Lately, we've been hearing a lot about the neurological impacts about acute COVID.

276
0:29:44,400 --> 0:29:50,480
Now, there was an article, The Lancet, Child and Adolescent Health. The peer-reviewed article

277
0:29:50,480 --> 0:29:57,600
appeared in this journal. Neurological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2, infection in hospitalized children

278
0:29:57,600 --> 0:30:04,160
adolescents in the UK, a prospective national cohort study, and the authors performed a prospective

279
0:30:04,160 --> 0:30:11,520
national cohort study in the UK looking at children adolescents, age less than 18, admitted to hospital

280
0:30:12,480 --> 0:30:18,480
with neurological or psychiatric disorders in whom they considered SARS-CoV-2 infection to be

281
0:30:18,480 --> 0:30:25,440
relevant to the presentation. They identified 1334 children and adolescents hospitalized with

282
0:30:25,440 --> 0:30:34,880
COVID-19 and reported a prevalence of 3.8%. Neurological psychiatric disorders following

283
0:30:34,880 --> 0:30:42,560
hospitalization for COVID-19. So, 3.8% of these adolescents and children that have been hospitalized

284
0:30:42,560 --> 0:30:48,400
for COVID-19 went on to have neurological or psychiatric disorders. So, that's about 1 in 25.

285
0:30:48,400 --> 0:30:55,280
The diagnosis included seizures, encephalitis, that's inflammation of the brain,

286
0:30:55,280 --> 0:31:02,160
Guillain-Barre, acute demyelinating syndromes, Korea, which is these uncontrolled movements,

287
0:31:02,160 --> 0:31:09,840
psychosis, psychosis, encephalopathy, transient ischemic attack, even one child had a stroke.

288
0:31:09,840 --> 0:31:14,880
So, you can just imagine how devastating. So, again, I try to give people a balance here between

289
0:31:14,880 --> 0:31:20,880
the risks of COVID in children, should they require hospitalization versus the risks associated

290
0:31:20,880 --> 0:31:28,080
with vaccination. So, I think this helps to give us more information around the decision making

291
0:31:28,080 --> 0:31:33,600
with regard to vaccination and mitigation strategies for children. We're still working to get solid

292
0:31:33,600 --> 0:31:40,480
numbers, but the risk for children, death is rare, hundreds of children have died of COVID here in

293
0:31:40,480 --> 0:31:47,120
the US. Hospitalization is uncommon. Thousands have ended up in the hospital. I think in the UK,

294
0:31:47,120 --> 0:31:54,960
they already have over 1,000 hospitalizations in just July, and long COVID seems to be a

295
0:31:54,960 --> 0:31:59,760
significant risk. Now, this last article, this could be the last article we hit on.

296
0:32:00,400 --> 0:32:06,640
This was in the New England Journal of Medicine, COVID-19 breakthrough infections in vaccinated

297
0:32:06,640 --> 0:32:11,200
healthcare workers. Now, the B word is in the title, so I couldn't leave that out.

298
0:32:12,800 --> 0:32:20,560
The authors reported on infections in vaccinated healthcare workers, and they looked at 1,497

299
0:32:20,560 --> 0:32:29,760
fully vaccinated healthcare workers for whom RTPCR data was available. 39 SARS-CoV-2 infections

300
0:32:29,760 --> 0:32:38,800
was documented in this 1,497 person cohort. They calculate an infection rate of 0.4%,

301
0:32:39,680 --> 0:32:44,640
less than half a percent. There were a few interesting findings. They reported of

302
0:32:45,760 --> 0:32:52,720
these individuals, 74% of the case patients had a high RNA level. I'm translating here because

303
0:32:52,720 --> 0:32:58,000
they call it viral load, but I'm going to say this is a CT value. This is an RNA copy number,

304
0:32:58,000 --> 0:33:05,280
74% of the individuals had a CT value of less than 30 at some point during their infection.

305
0:33:05,280 --> 0:33:13,360
However, of these patients, 59, only 59% had a positive, concordant, antigen,

306
0:33:13,360 --> 0:33:19,040
rapid detection test. I think this is kind of interesting, and I just want our listeners to

307
0:33:19,040 --> 0:33:26,080
think a little bit about what does a CT value mean. We know the relationship between CT values

308
0:33:26,080 --> 0:33:34,160
or RNA copy numbers and infectiousness in unvaccinated people, but what does this mean

309
0:33:34,160 --> 0:33:40,800
in vaccinated individuals? They also reported that neutralizing antibody titers in case patients

310
0:33:40,800 --> 0:33:46,960
during the peri infection period were lower than those in matched, uninfected controls.

311
0:33:46,960 --> 0:33:51,680
Not clear if that's a marker for people with other risk issues or if that's actually a causal

312
0:33:51,680 --> 0:33:59,200
connection. There is a figure three where that correlation, if you look at the figure, it's

313
0:33:59,200 --> 0:34:03,520
not really that impressed, but I will leave it up to our readers to go ahead and take a look.

314
0:34:03,520 --> 0:34:09,920
This is not behind a paywall. They did report that most of the breakthrough cases were mild or

315
0:34:09,920 --> 0:34:16,000
asymptomatic, but here was a bit of why is this in the long COVID section of the people that had

316
0:34:16,000 --> 0:34:22,320
symptomatic infections post-vaccination? And remember, this was a small amount. This was less than 1%,

317
0:34:22,960 --> 0:34:28,000
19% of those people that did have a symptomatic case went on to have persistent symptoms for

318
0:34:28,000 --> 0:34:34,480
greater than six weeks. So I'm sort of put this in context. Getting a symptomatic infection post

319
0:34:34,480 --> 0:34:41,280
vaccine is very uncommon, but it does happen, but should you get that, it actually looks like a

320
0:34:41,280 --> 0:34:48,480
pretty similar rate of long COVID in these individuals. So pretty on par with unvaccinated.

321
0:34:49,040 --> 0:34:52,880
What's going on the rest of the world? I think this is important for us to keep an eye on that.

322
0:34:52,880 --> 0:34:59,120
We continue to see rising case rates and deaths with much of the world still being a vaccine

323
0:34:59,120 --> 0:35:05,280
desert. I like to say no one is safe until everyone is safe and we are far from that at this point.

324
0:35:06,160 --> 0:35:10,720
Whether it's to protect ourselves or through altruism, this pandemic does not end until we

325
0:35:10,720 --> 0:35:16,720
have widespread access and acceptance of vaccines. So I want to thank everyone who's

326
0:35:16,720 --> 0:35:22,640
continuing to go to parasites without borders.com clicking on the donate button. This is going to

327
0:35:22,640 --> 0:35:29,200
drop the last day of July. We're trying to make that $20,000 donation level so that we can give a

328
0:35:29,200 --> 0:35:35,120
full $40,000 to support Foundation International Medical Relief of Children. They've actually

329
0:35:35,120 --> 0:35:41,200
started to open up some of their travels to some of their sites. So brighter, brighter days on the

330
0:35:41,200 --> 0:35:46,880
on the horizon, but this work is going to require funding and support. So please help us support

331
0:35:46,880 --> 0:35:54,720
femric. Daniel, that last paper is of consequence to the CDC decision on masking, which is based on

332
0:35:54,720 --> 0:36:01,920
this PCR equivalence between Delta vaccinated and Delta unvaccinated would suggest that that's

333
0:36:01,920 --> 0:36:08,640
flawed, right? In their case. Yeah, I think that that's really a problem. One is it looks like the

334
0:36:08,640 --> 0:36:14,400
people who are vaccinated are very like less than 1% risk of even testing positive. And then if they

335
0:36:14,400 --> 0:36:20,480
do test positive, you can't just use CT values because you're looking at RNA. It's not viral load.

336
0:36:21,120 --> 0:36:29,360
And I sort of hope that the CDC isn't making that. Can we call it a rookie mistake? You need to

337
0:36:29,360 --> 0:36:35,280
ask. And I think the fact that we're not picking up antigen that we're not seeing the protein

338
0:36:35,280 --> 0:36:40,960
production does really suggest that maybe that RNA level is not correlating with infectious

339
0:36:41,680 --> 0:36:44,160
virus. Yep. And we need a little more data.

340
0:36:45,520 --> 0:36:54,800
Yep. The other thing, Daniel, I wasn't a call yesterday from Mumbai. And one of the women on the

341
0:36:54,800 --> 0:37:00,080
call said they have immunized 450 million people in India.

342
0:37:01,040 --> 0:37:05,920
Wow. That is impressive. Now, compared to the US, that's very impressive.

343
0:37:07,440 --> 0:37:12,800
We'd be done if we had done that in the US. They, but it's not even half of their population,

344
0:37:12,800 --> 0:37:20,240
right? But she said, in India, we don't have a problem with people getting vaccinated.

345
0:37:20,240 --> 0:37:27,440
Interesting. I mean, I think I shared, and this is one of this week in paracetism,

346
0:37:27,440 --> 0:37:31,680
where I was talking about Ben Lebrot. We were in one of these little communities,

347
0:37:32,400 --> 0:37:39,280
and we were talking to one of the women, no-bay woman, about the fact that in the United States,

348
0:37:39,280 --> 0:37:44,160
we actually have people that do not want to vaccinate their children. And she looked at

349
0:37:44,160 --> 0:37:48,880
us a little confused, and she said, but don't your parents love their children in America?

350
0:37:48,880 --> 0:37:59,600
Yeah. Indeed, indeed. Okay, time for some email questions for Daniel. You can send yours to

351
0:37:59,600 --> 0:38:05,360
Daniel at microbe.tv. The first is from Alan, a gastroenterologist in New York.

352
0:38:06,080 --> 0:38:13,280
If a fully vaccinated patient who was in a high risk group age over 65 or medical comorbidities

353
0:38:13,280 --> 0:38:19,200
developed an early COVID infection, would you recommend monoclonal antibody with the level of

354
0:38:19,200 --> 0:38:24,080
the patient's COVID antibody obtained at the time of infection, make a difference in deciding the

355
0:38:24,080 --> 0:38:30,160
treatment? I realize there may not be any randomized trials for this type of situation. However,

356
0:38:30,160 --> 0:38:35,680
clinicians frequently have to make decisions in the absence of good data or good studies.

357
0:38:36,880 --> 0:38:40,800
This is an excellent question, and I'm going to break it down into two parts.

358
0:38:40,800 --> 0:38:46,640
So let's say this is a person who's been vaccinated. They've not been infected with COVID before.

359
0:38:46,640 --> 0:38:51,520
They're in that first week, and I'm going to throw the person who's been infected before

360
0:38:51,520 --> 0:38:56,880
also vaccinated in that first week. We do recommend monoclonal antibody therapy in those

361
0:38:56,880 --> 0:39:03,360
individuals. Your prior vaccination status does not impact your eligibility or our recommendation

362
0:39:03,360 --> 0:39:09,440
for monoclonal antibody therapy. Now, I will say, have we repeated the studies with vaccinated

363
0:39:09,440 --> 0:39:14,560
people to see if we're still getting that 70 to 80% reduction in progression? We have not,

364
0:39:15,600 --> 0:39:20,240
but we're not excluding people who are vaccinated. The other little twist, so let's say you're not

365
0:39:20,240 --> 0:39:27,440
sure about the timing, and this person has not been infected with SARS-CoV-2 before,

366
0:39:27,440 --> 0:39:32,880
you can check a nuclear capsid antibody test to see, are you really catching them early

367
0:39:32,880 --> 0:39:38,640
before they start producing their own antibodies? Because that really is what we've seen as far as

368
0:39:38,640 --> 0:39:44,720
the benefit of monoclonals. If you can give people the monoclonals prior to them developing

369
0:39:44,720 --> 0:39:49,040
their own antibodies, those are the patients that we see the most benefit. And I just

370
0:39:49,040 --> 0:39:54,000
recently had a case where it was really unclear to me. A person was cognitively not 100%.

371
0:39:55,200 --> 0:40:00,080
Sounded to me like we were only two or three days in. We did a stat nuclear capsid antibody.

372
0:40:00,080 --> 0:40:06,000
It was negative, and I went ahead and recommended monoclonals. But no, we have not repeated these

373
0:40:06,000 --> 0:40:12,400
monoclonal studies in vaccinated people. But if they've broken through, gotten a symptomatic case,

374
0:40:12,960 --> 0:40:16,560
I think it makes sense not only to reduce the hospitalization and death rate,

375
0:40:17,120 --> 0:40:21,440
and we're working on data because maybe it's also going to impact their risk of long COVID.

376
0:40:23,200 --> 0:40:26,880
Linda writes, I wanted to understand the role of at-home,

377
0:40:27,600 --> 0:40:33,440
rapid antigen tests for the vaccinated person following exposure to a COVID positive vaccinated

378
0:40:33,440 --> 0:40:38,640
individual. Currently, as I understand New York rules, no quarantine or testing is required for

379
0:40:38,640 --> 0:40:43,440
the vaccinated person that's been exposed. I find that a tad concerning and wanted to protect my

380
0:40:43,440 --> 0:40:49,280
family, no one in a high risk category, and friends following such an exposure, and so have been

381
0:40:49,280 --> 0:40:54,320
wearing a mask at home and limiting my exposures to others for what will be seven days, timing of

382
0:40:54,320 --> 0:40:58,480
my choice based on my own review of the current debates. I'm not sure what the magic number of

383
0:40:58,480 --> 0:41:02,960
days should be, particularly as I go on this frolic of my own, since no one is telling me I

384
0:41:02,960 --> 0:41:07,680
have to do anything other than wear mask indoors. I feel like there's a role for the at-home

385
0:41:07,680 --> 0:41:12,480
antigen test in this setting and consider doing it at days three, then six. I just really don't

386
0:41:12,480 --> 0:41:18,080
know what the reasonable approach is following close exposure to a COVID positive vaccinated

387
0:41:18,080 --> 0:41:22,800
individual. Can you explain if the at-home antigen test plays a useful role in this context?

388
0:41:23,840 --> 0:41:29,120
Yeah, so this is a fantastic question. We have great listeners, or maybe Vincent just picks

389
0:41:29,120 --> 0:41:35,280
out the really great listener questions, but so we'll give everyone credit here. But we do know

390
0:41:35,280 --> 0:41:42,640
that a vaccinated person can develop a symptomatic case of COVID-19 and can transmit to others,

391
0:41:42,640 --> 0:41:48,480
right? Not only is that well-described, but I've seen several cases myself. Can any

392
0:41:48,480 --> 0:41:55,040
asymptomatic vaccinated person get enough virus that they're going to transmit to someone else?

393
0:41:55,040 --> 0:42:00,800
A bit of uncertainty there. We could use some better data. The last study we talked about

394
0:42:01,360 --> 0:42:07,840
were these individuals who are fully vaccinated got infection. We're talking about 0.2% actually

395
0:42:07,840 --> 0:42:13,680
had a positive antigen test. We're in sort of, we need a little more information here.

396
0:42:14,240 --> 0:42:19,840
If it turns out that vaccinated people only transmit, this is sort of case control and tracking

397
0:42:19,840 --> 0:42:26,400
studies. If they only transmit with symptoms, that's helpful. But I think if you're trying to be on

398
0:42:26,400 --> 0:42:34,080
the side of extra caution, you are vaccinated, you've had an exposure, you may be pre-symptomatic,

399
0:42:34,080 --> 0:42:38,640
right? Because you can't get symptomatic. I think that the antigen test is a reasonable

400
0:42:38,640 --> 0:42:43,840
extra layer. So remember, always looking at layers, looking at people's different risk tolerances,

401
0:42:43,840 --> 0:42:50,560
and I think it can factor into that. Gabriel writes, a friend of mine suffers from

402
0:42:50,560 --> 0:42:56,560
Bruton's agamoglobulinemia, and many medical doctors in Ecuador do not recommend any COVID

403
0:42:56,560 --> 0:43:01,440
vaccine for him. I'm a microbiologist. I've carried out research and immunology, and though I understand

404
0:43:01,440 --> 0:43:05,840
that he can't produce antibodies, the T cell responses should be fine. I don't see any risks

405
0:43:05,840 --> 0:43:10,000
of getting vaccinated. I would appreciate your opinion about whether he should receive vaccine,

406
0:43:10,000 --> 0:43:17,200
what kind of vaccine would be better. So I definitely would encourage vaccination. I think we've tried

407
0:43:17,200 --> 0:43:24,480
to reinforce several times that there's more than one arm of the immune system. I'd say two,

408
0:43:24,480 --> 0:43:28,640
that's a little simplistic, but there's the B cell antibody production. We're not going to get

409
0:43:28,640 --> 0:43:35,760
that with Bruton's agamoglobulinemia, but we should be able to get a protective T cell response.

410
0:43:35,760 --> 0:43:41,920
And our data, our understanding of immunology suggests that it's that T cell response that

411
0:43:41,920 --> 0:43:48,480
is really critical in protection against severe disease, hospitalization, and death. So I definitely

412
0:43:48,480 --> 0:43:55,280
would encourage vaccination. I would say whatever vaccine you can get access to, I would go ahead.

413
0:43:55,280 --> 0:44:02,400
Don't be picky. Don't be sally. And the last is from Abby, which is really a comment, but we

414
0:44:02,400 --> 0:44:08,640
should read the Peds New York here. My daughter was 17 in early March 2020 when I brought COVID

415
0:44:08,640 --> 0:44:15,600
home from the Peds clinic. She had mild illness was a fit rugby player still having GI issues,

416
0:44:15,600 --> 0:44:21,600
neurological symptoms, tachycardia, fatigue, brain fog, depression, couldn't eat lost 20 pounds.

417
0:44:21,600 --> 0:44:27,040
We need more parents to learn about long COVID. Many docs are saying it's mild in kids and they

418
0:44:27,040 --> 0:44:33,520
are just as at fault, not vaccinating their own kids. Millions of kids with this around the world.

419
0:44:35,040 --> 0:44:40,160
Yeah, you know, Vincent, we keep seeing these sort of scoreboards, dashboards,

420
0:44:40,880 --> 0:44:45,280
you know, Hopkins world demeanor, and they have number of cases, they have hospitalizations,

421
0:44:45,280 --> 0:44:50,720
they have deaths. What they are missing is long COVID. And I think that that's a critical number

422
0:44:50,720 --> 0:44:56,800
as well. So when we see pretty soon, over 100,000 cases a day here in the US, welcome to

423
0:44:56,800 --> 0:45:02,080
August, I'm predicting, you know, what percent of those individuals are going to continue to be

424
0:45:02,080 --> 0:45:06,080
ill. And I think that's really an important thing. And so when you look at kids and you say,

425
0:45:06,080 --> 0:45:12,640
oh, kids, well, we can see the deaths, we can see the hospitalizations, but what about the long

426
0:45:12,640 --> 0:45:17,680
term, you know, greater than four weeks, greater than 12 weeks of long COVID. And I think stories

427
0:45:17,680 --> 0:45:22,480
like this parent parents need to hear because parents are not necessarily swayed by scientific

428
0:45:22,480 --> 0:45:29,040
studies, they're swayed by stories, by people sharing these experiences. So as I sort of brought

429
0:45:29,040 --> 0:45:34,720
out last time having conversations about vaccines, you know, if your child has suffered, let's

430
0:45:34,720 --> 0:45:39,680
share these stories because we do not need even one more child suffering with long COVID.

431
0:45:39,680 --> 0:45:46,080
That's COVID-19 clinical update number 73 with Dr. Daniel Griffin. Thank you, Daniel.

432
0:45:46,080 --> 0:45:52,880
Oh, thank you. And everyone, be safe.
