This week in virology, the podcast about viruses, the kind that make you sick.

2
0:00:10,320 --> 0:00:21,280
From Microbe TV, this is Twiv, this week in virology, episode 730 recorded on March 11, 2021.

3
0:00:21,280 --> 0:00:28,320
I'm Vincent Draconiello and you are listening to the podcast all about viruses. Joining me today

4
0:00:28,320 --> 0:00:37,120
from New York, Daniel Griffin. Hello, everyone. Update number 53. How's everything going, Daniel?

5
0:00:38,160 --> 0:00:45,120
You know, I will say I still am optimistic here on the ground. Things seem to be going in the right

6
0:00:45,120 --> 0:00:51,920
direction. I was just just today, one of the one of the Catholic hospitals where I go, you know,

7
0:00:51,920 --> 0:00:57,680
they have they've closed their COVID unit. They no longer have a COVID unit at that hospital.

8
0:00:57,680 --> 0:01:02,880
That's one of the other hospitals. The numbers have dropped to maybe 20 percent of where they

9
0:01:02,880 --> 0:01:08,240
peaked. So numbers are going down in the hospital. Unfortunately, we still have several people in

10
0:01:08,240 --> 0:01:16,080
the ICU struggling who probably won't make it. And, you know, and one of your shows, I think,

11
0:01:16,080 --> 0:01:21,040
was Ginger Campbell said that, hey, if you end up in the ICU, it's 5050. If you end up on a ventilator,

12
0:01:21,680 --> 0:01:27,040
I actually say actually it's much more depressing than that. I was reviewing with some of the ICU

13
0:01:27,040 --> 0:01:33,040
doctors single digit survival this time. Really, we're doing everything we can to keep people off

14
0:01:33,040 --> 0:01:39,280
the ventilators. So the people that end up on the ventilators, it really is well under 10 percent

15
0:01:39,280 --> 0:01:44,480
that are surviving in our experience. And then some of the ones that are just tragic,

16
0:01:44,480 --> 0:01:50,160
this one woman who's now out of the ICU, just very vacant. I'm not sure there's much cognitive

17
0:01:50,160 --> 0:01:56,160
function left. So just just a tragedy. So I think her talk about how important palliative care

18
0:01:56,160 --> 0:02:02,720
decisions are is unfortunately really critical here with COVID. My quotation, it is easy enough to

19
0:02:02,720 --> 0:02:09,040
vote right and be consistently with the majority. But it is more often more important to be ahead

20
0:02:09,040 --> 0:02:14,480
of the majority. And this means being willing to cut the first furrow in the ground and stand

21
0:02:14,480 --> 0:02:23,360
alone for a while, if necessary. And this is by Patsy Make. In 1964, she ran for federal office

22
0:02:23,360 --> 0:02:28,320
and won a seat in the US House of Representatives was the first woman of color, the first Asian

23
0:02:28,320 --> 0:02:37,120
American elected to Congress. And I just think that it's a very appropriate quotation. It's easy

24
0:02:37,120 --> 0:02:42,240
to sort of group together. And I hear a lot of people now is just doing a talk for a group at

25
0:02:42,240 --> 0:02:46,720
University of Pittsburgh, where people are all agreeing like, Oh, who could have really seen this

26
0:02:46,720 --> 0:02:53,680
coming? And you know what, we warned about this pandemic for a long time. And we're warning that

27
0:02:53,680 --> 0:02:59,440
this will not necessarily be the last pandemic if we don't respond differently. So I know everyone's

28
0:02:59,440 --> 0:03:02,960
all excited and they want to go out there and have their big parties and hug everyone. But

29
0:03:02,960 --> 0:03:07,440
let's not let this happen again, right? Let's while we're still here, while it's still fresh

30
0:03:07,440 --> 0:03:12,560
in our mind, let's spend the money now, let's make the decisions now, let's get the changes in

31
0:03:12,560 --> 0:03:16,960
place. This doesn't happen again. This this has been rotten. This has been horrible. And a lot of

32
0:03:16,960 --> 0:03:22,160
people have died. So never miss an opportunity to vaccinate, never miss an opportunity to test,

33
0:03:22,160 --> 0:03:28,080
never waste a vaccine dose. Vaccines are getting better. But I'm actually going to start with

34
0:03:28,080 --> 0:03:34,800
children and COVID. As we see more adults getting vaccinated, there's a growing push to get the

35
0:03:34,800 --> 0:03:40,800
kids back into schools, getting ready for summer camp and opening many things up for children.

36
0:03:40,800 --> 0:03:46,400
The one thing I will say on the ground here is this is not going well for kids. I was talking to

37
0:03:46,400 --> 0:03:53,440
my buddy, Dr. Jovino, he's one of the only adults who calls me Danny. And you know, he can get away

38
0:03:53,440 --> 0:04:01,440
with it. But he was saying, you know, we are now seeing its children, growing numbers of children

39
0:04:01,440 --> 0:04:09,120
getting diagnosed with COVID. Last week, we saw the article in the CDC and MWR estimated SARS-CoV-2

40
0:04:09,120 --> 0:04:14,720
seroprevalence among persons aged less than 18 years, Mississippi, and it was made through

41
0:04:14,720 --> 0:04:21,840
September 2020. And they looked at serological tests on blood samples collected between May and

42
0:04:21,840 --> 0:04:29,680
September 2020, from 1,603 persons aged less than 18. And they found on the serological testing,

43
0:04:29,680 --> 0:04:36,240
16.3% of these were positive. And they actually suggested that at this prevalence rate,

44
0:04:36,240 --> 0:04:47,680
over 113,842 of the 698,420 young persons in Mississippi have been infected with SARS-CoV-2

45
0:04:47,680 --> 0:04:56,560
by mid-September. And of note, there's only been 8,993 confirmed or probable COVID-19 cases reported

46
0:04:56,560 --> 0:05:01,440
among young persons to the Mississippi State Department of Health. So if you do the math,

47
0:05:01,440 --> 0:05:08,880
this means that we're only catching about 8% of the COVID-19 infections in this young population,

48
0:05:08,880 --> 0:05:16,800
meaning that over 90% are going undiagnosed. In the same article, they reference the CDC data,

49
0:05:16,800 --> 0:05:24,240
suggesting there have been just over 3 million reported COVID-19 cases in the U.S.

50
0:05:24,240 --> 0:05:31,600
in persons aged less than 18. Now, if this is under diagnosis, instead of 3 million, that would

51
0:05:31,600 --> 0:05:39,200
put us closer to about 40 million cases in children, even with a prevalence of 16%. It means that

52
0:05:39,200 --> 0:05:45,840
over 80% of our children are still at risk of COVID-19. And unfortunately, I think we're seeing that

53
0:05:45,840 --> 0:05:50,800
on the ground here in New York. One of the things, and this was what Dr. Yovino and I were talking

54
0:05:50,800 --> 0:05:56,880
about is that the parents are quite upset because they're saying we were told that COVID was a very

55
0:05:56,880 --> 0:06:02,560
mild thing in kids. What's going on? We were told that children are less likely to die.

56
0:06:02,560 --> 0:06:06,080
They're less likely to hospitalize. They're less likely to have severe COVID.

57
0:06:06,960 --> 0:06:12,240
I discussed the data coming out of the UK that about 10% of the kids that develop COVID,

58
0:06:12,240 --> 0:06:17,680
it is not just a mild, short-lived disease, but it lasts. I was just on a call Tuesday evening

59
0:06:17,680 --> 0:06:23,280
with our pediatricians. Maybe I was just trying to depress myself, but I wanted to ask them and

60
0:06:23,280 --> 0:06:27,680
say, okay, I see the numbers in the literature. But one of the things that hopefully I add with

61
0:06:27,680 --> 0:06:33,360
these clinical updates is what are we actually seeing? Let's translate these studies into what

62
0:06:33,360 --> 0:06:39,200
we're seeing on the ground. And every pediatrician on the call had stories of a growing number of

63
0:06:39,840 --> 0:06:46,320
young individuals that they're taking care of that are suffering. And just to share a few of these

64
0:06:46,320 --> 0:06:54,400
stories with everyone, it was a 16-year-old's girl, loves soccer. She got sick with COVID

65
0:06:55,600 --> 0:07:01,280
two, three months ago. But her family wanted to make sure before she got us, you saw the cardiologist.

66
0:07:01,280 --> 0:07:06,640
They did echocardiogram. Everything was fine. They said, you've been cleared. We think you're

67
0:07:06,640 --> 0:07:12,960
fine to play soccer. This is a gal who used to run several miles a day. Her life is all about soccer.

68
0:07:12,960 --> 0:07:16,720
She tried to play the first game. She was like, I can't run up and down the field.

69
0:07:17,520 --> 0:07:23,840
So she's not going to play soccer this year. And she's devastated. It was another young woman

70
0:07:23,840 --> 0:07:30,640
who had a lacrosse scholarship. She she can't play. There was a boy. This really I found quite

71
0:07:30,640 --> 0:07:36,400
upsetting. He had COVID. And his teacher called the mom and saying, what is up with your son? He

72
0:07:36,400 --> 0:07:42,400
can't pay attention in class. And she said, yeah, he had COVID a few months back. He cannot maintain

73
0:07:42,400 --> 0:07:49,440
his attention. He just gets distracted. He can't keep focus. And so I think a lot of what we're

74
0:07:49,440 --> 0:07:56,000
seeing is the kids, when they're forced either to try to compete athletically, they realize, oh,

75
0:07:56,000 --> 0:08:01,440
my gosh, I am so much diminished where I used to be, or they're asked to do a cognitive task,

76
0:08:01,440 --> 0:08:07,600
like pay attention and do well in school. So I worry about this. This is something we're seeing

77
0:08:07,600 --> 0:08:13,120
in the literature. This is something now the pediatrician shared with me. And even something

78
0:08:13,120 --> 0:08:18,640
has changed a little bit about the multi inflammatory syndrome. My colleague and friend Jay Berger

79
0:08:18,640 --> 0:08:26,400
has taken care of a young individual now, who's in the ICU early on 5050 with these individuals

80
0:08:26,400 --> 0:08:32,480
with the late inflammatory phase ending up in the ICU. Now 90% of them are progressing to the ICU.

81
0:08:32,480 --> 0:08:37,840
So I'm not sure what to say here other than just, you know, we need to be a little bit honest with

82
0:08:37,840 --> 0:08:43,680
the parents is that, yeah, your son or daughter may not die or end up in the hospital with COVID.

83
0:08:43,680 --> 0:08:48,400
They may be at lower risk, but I'm not sure I'm completely comfortable if one of my children

84
0:08:48,400 --> 0:08:53,920
end up getting COVID and maybe having long term complications testing. We saw the first EUA for

85
0:08:53,920 --> 0:09:01,440
a T cell COVID test, the T detect COVID test by adaptive biotechnologies. And this is something

86
0:09:01,440 --> 0:09:07,120
a person can go online, click a few buttons, pay a little more money than most of us would like to,

87
0:09:07,120 --> 0:09:14,320
and actually get a COVID T cell test. So I'm glad we're seeing more attention being paid to the T

88
0:09:14,320 --> 0:09:21,600
cells. My PhD was in B cell biology, but much of my clinical practice and research is focused on HIV.

89
0:09:21,600 --> 0:09:26,720
So T cells have gotten a lot of attention from me over time. You know, a little sad for the T cells

90
0:09:26,720 --> 0:09:31,120
they were neglected there for about a year, but now they're getting that attention that they've,

91
0:09:31,680 --> 0:09:39,760
you know, long had because of the HIV epidemic still is ongoing. So this is a $150 test that

92
0:09:39,760 --> 0:09:48,400
can be done either as an in home or an in lab blood draw. Basically a patient goes on the website,

93
0:09:48,400 --> 0:09:55,760
they click a bunch of buttons. And then this test reportedly compared to the antibody tests are

94
0:09:55,760 --> 0:10:05,120
saying this as a greater than 99% specificity, about a 95% sensitivity. And this is detecting

95
0:10:05,120 --> 0:10:11,680
prior infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. It's really a fascinating test.

96
0:10:12,480 --> 0:10:18,080
And I was on a call with the same company talking about a study that we're trying to help them with

97
0:10:18,080 --> 0:10:24,560
with Lyme disease. And I realized as we were talking, I said, hey, you're the same people with the T

98
0:10:24,560 --> 0:10:30,400
cell test. This is the same technology. So it gave me a chance to really drill a little bit down.

99
0:10:31,360 --> 0:10:36,560
And the technology, they actually have a preprint out there describing it, preprint is

100
0:10:36,560 --> 0:10:43,760
clinical validation of a novel T cell receptor sequencing assay for identification of recent

101
0:10:43,760 --> 0:10:49,280
or prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. So it's a little bit interesting, but let me just explain to our

102
0:10:49,280 --> 0:10:56,720
listeners like how this technology works and why I think it's superior to the technology we've

103
0:10:56,720 --> 0:11:02,160
been using for tuberculosis tests. And throw my disclaimer, they're not paying me any money for

104
0:11:02,160 --> 0:11:07,680
this, nor do I think they will in the future, but I will explain the technology. Normally,

105
0:11:07,680 --> 0:11:15,680
to look for T cell reactivity to tuberculosis, we do a three tube assay. The first tube is our

106
0:11:15,680 --> 0:11:22,240
negative control. And then we actually draw up a tube, which has some proteins that are specific

107
0:11:22,240 --> 0:11:27,040
to mycobacterium tuberculosis, or I should say, somewhat specific to the mycobacterium

108
0:11:27,040 --> 0:11:31,760
tuberculosis complex. And then we have a positive control with a mitogen, which is going to stimulate

109
0:11:31,760 --> 0:11:37,280
the T cells to produce interfering gamma. You shake those up, you mix that all around,

110
0:11:37,280 --> 0:11:41,920
you have to draw it in the right order. It involves an assay looking at live cells,

111
0:11:41,920 --> 0:11:46,960
so you need to run this within eight hours. You need to treat these tubes properly. You can't

112
0:11:46,960 --> 0:11:51,760
freeze them. You can't let them sit too long. And then what you're going to do is do an assay

113
0:11:51,760 --> 0:11:56,960
that's going to say whether or not you have specific memory T cells that are going to be

114
0:11:56,960 --> 0:12:02,880
triggered by those proteins and produce the interfering gamma, which is your signature TH1

115
0:12:02,880 --> 0:12:09,360
cytokine. Immunologists can yell at me if I made that too simple. I think that's reasonable

116
0:12:09,360 --> 0:12:14,320
description. Now, what this does instead, and it's actually much easier, is you're going to

117
0:12:14,320 --> 0:12:21,120
be doing PCR. So you're merely going to collect a tube of blood. This tube can be frozen, it can

118
0:12:21,120 --> 0:12:28,720
be stored. You do a simple DNA extraction followed by a multiplex PCR that amplifies the rearranged

119
0:12:28,720 --> 0:12:34,400
T cell receptor sequences. And then this PCR product is popped onto an Illumina sequencing

120
0:12:34,400 --> 0:12:40,960
machine. And a computer algorithm is going to identify whether the sequences that are specific

121
0:12:40,960 --> 0:12:49,680
for targeting or enriched for targeting of SARS-CoV-2 are enhanced. And they have a specified

122
0:12:49,680 --> 0:12:55,040
threshold. And there's about 4,000 enhanced sequences that have been identified. So this

123
0:12:55,040 --> 0:12:59,920
actually is quite a bit easier. You don't have to worry about having a lab on site that can do these

124
0:12:59,920 --> 0:13:05,200
live cell assays quickly. How are we going to use this test? I think that's the other question.

125
0:13:05,920 --> 0:13:10,960
I see this personally as potentially something we'll be looking at in those individuals who

126
0:13:11,600 --> 0:13:18,240
we suspect have long COVID, but either couldn't get a PCR test upfront, or maybe have a negative

127
0:13:18,240 --> 0:13:23,760
antibody test and we're trying to pick up those individuals. There was a, I know this was covered

128
0:13:23,760 --> 0:13:30,080
in TWIV-128, but I just want to jump it in here while we're talking about testing. And this was

129
0:13:30,080 --> 0:13:36,560
the paper SARS-CoV-2 total and subgenomic RNA viral loaded hospitalized patients posted as a

130
0:13:36,560 --> 0:13:44,400
preprint. Excellent discussion on TWIV-128. It can't be TWIV-120. I'm sure the numbers often mean 728.

131
0:13:46,080 --> 0:13:52,960
Have we done that many? Have you done that many? And really just confirming that total RNA

132
0:13:52,960 --> 0:13:59,040
copy number numbers correlate with subgenomic RNA. And then although PCR is very sensitive,

133
0:14:00,240 --> 0:14:05,200
when people have millions of RNA copies, when they have CT values in the 20s or lower,

134
0:14:05,840 --> 0:14:09,520
that's probably when people are infectious. And it looks like once those CT values are greater

135
0:14:09,520 --> 0:14:17,600
than 30, RNA copies are below the level of detection of our rapid antigen test, 50,000, 40,000 person

136
0:14:17,600 --> 0:14:22,960
is probably no longer infectious. So just nice to get a little more information there.

137
0:14:23,920 --> 0:14:29,920
Active vaccination, I won't say too much about this, except I am quite intrigued

138
0:14:29,920 --> 0:14:35,840
that J&J seems to be coming out as the crowd favorite, at least among a lot of my patients.

139
0:14:36,480 --> 0:14:42,240
And even what I was seeing is a lot of individuals at one of the large healthcare system. About half

140
0:14:42,240 --> 0:14:49,040
of them have been vaccine hesitant. They seem to be more comfortable with the J&J vaccine.

141
0:14:49,840 --> 0:14:54,400
Sort of the one and done feeling that it's not this mRNA technology. So

142
0:14:55,200 --> 0:15:01,200
exciting to see that. And I know I've spent a little time discussing the potential impact of

143
0:15:01,200 --> 0:15:10,000
vaccination on people with long COVID, passive vaccination, the variants. I hate the variants.

144
0:15:10,000 --> 0:15:14,720
David Ho emailed me this week, letting me know that at last check, more than a third of the

145
0:15:14,720 --> 0:15:25,680
sequences at CUMC have the E484K mutation that at least in the lab makes a bamlin of a map and

146
0:15:25,680 --> 0:15:32,960
in dev a map ineffective. These are, you know, one monoclonal from each of the Eli Lilly and

147
0:15:32,960 --> 0:15:39,200
the Regeneron cocktails. We've already actually started switching our therapies over on the ground

148
0:15:39,200 --> 0:15:43,920
here. So we've tried to switch over to the cocktail therapies with the idea that at least in New

149
0:15:43,920 --> 0:15:48,480
York City, in these regions where we're getting the sequence, about a one and three chance that

150
0:15:48,480 --> 0:15:55,600
you might be giving a therapy that is not effective. But we also, I got to say, this was the week

151
0:15:55,600 --> 0:16:02,800
of monoclonals. We got a press release. Eli Lilly and company announced new data from the

152
0:16:02,800 --> 0:16:09,840
randomized double blind placebo controlled blaze one phase three study demonstrating bamlin of a

153
0:16:09,840 --> 0:16:16,480
map and a test of a map together significantly reduced COVID-19 related hospitalizations and deaths

154
0:16:17,360 --> 0:16:23,920
events in the high risk patients recently diagnosed with COVID-19. So go into a little bit more of the

155
0:16:23,920 --> 0:16:34,080
weeds on this. This phase three included 769 high risk patients. There were 511 got therapy,

156
0:16:34,080 --> 0:16:39,600
258 got placebo. So it was roughly a two to one match events, meaning either hospitalization or

157
0:16:39,600 --> 0:16:47,040
death occurred in 0.8% of those receiving the cocktail, 6% receiving placebo, which represented

158
0:16:47,040 --> 0:16:55,760
87% risk reduction with a p-value of 0.001. So this cocktail bamlin of a map and a test of a map

159
0:16:55,760 --> 0:17:02,240
together demonstrated statistically significant improvements on key secondary endpoints. There

160
0:17:02,240 --> 0:17:07,600
were four deaths total in the trial that were attributed to COVID-19. And they all occurred

161
0:17:07,600 --> 0:17:16,480
in patients getting placebo. Nobody who received the cocktail diet. So that was 0% versus 1.5% in

162
0:17:16,480 --> 0:17:22,880
placebo. So this is interesting, right? You know, number needed to treat and what kind of reduction

163
0:17:22,880 --> 0:17:28,560
are we doing here? The pricing in a sense is targeted to this. You say we've got a population

164
0:17:28,560 --> 0:17:35,440
with about a 10% risk of dying or ending up in the hospital. And we're able to reduce that

165
0:17:35,440 --> 0:17:40,880
dramatically. We know that if a person ends up in the hospital, you know, they have a significant

166
0:17:40,880 --> 0:17:45,760
chance of dying, but there's also a significant morbidity and it tends to be very expensive. I

167
0:17:45,760 --> 0:17:51,920
think we've pegged it at about $40,000 on average for a hospitalization. So they've kind of run

168
0:17:51,920 --> 0:17:58,080
the numbers on this. Your number needed to treat has a lot to do with which risk group you're

169
0:17:58,080 --> 0:18:04,320
targeting here. We also heard from Veer, biotech, and GSK. Where are these people coming from?

170
0:18:05,520 --> 0:18:11,840
I've been sort of watching this in the background, but they released a press release and I thought

171
0:18:11,840 --> 0:18:18,800
this was funny. They promised to post a preprint on the results of their comet ice study. So this

172
0:18:18,800 --> 0:18:28,080
is COVID-19 monoclonal antibody efficacy trial intent to care early. What a name. And this trial

173
0:18:28,080 --> 0:18:36,080
evaluated, this is going to roll right off the tongue, VIR7831. So Veer7831 or that's a little

174
0:18:36,080 --> 0:18:44,560
hard. You can call it GSK4182136. This is a monoclonal antibody. And this is this is neat,

175
0:18:44,560 --> 0:18:51,440
actually. It targets a conserved part of the spike protein. And so they studied this as

176
0:18:51,440 --> 0:18:57,600
monotherapy. I'm going to sort of go into what I mean by that. And they they presented this

177
0:18:57,600 --> 0:19:06,640
press release interim analysis from 583 patients were enrolled and they demonstrated 85% reduction

178
0:19:06,640 --> 0:19:14,320
in hospitalization or death, p-value 0.002. So right in that same ballpark. So a little bit

179
0:19:14,320 --> 0:19:20,480
of notes about this. So this is a very I think a fascinating concept is you find an area on the

180
0:19:20,480 --> 0:19:27,680
spike protein that cannot change without disrupting the ability of the virus to basically complete

181
0:19:27,680 --> 0:19:33,040
its biology. So it's a a required sequence, something that cannot be changed, a conserved

182
0:19:33,040 --> 0:19:39,280
sequence. Interesting enough, this epitope is shared with SARS-CoV-1. It's also an epitope

183
0:19:39,280 --> 0:19:46,880
that SARS-CoV-1 can't change. A couple other things about this antibody is that they are using

184
0:19:46,880 --> 0:19:54,080
this is entertaining a proprietary Zen core extend NFC technology that allows for higher

185
0:19:54,080 --> 0:19:58,800
airway antibody levels and extended half life. So I'm not sure exactly what they're doing to get

186
0:19:58,800 --> 0:20:03,600
it into the airways better. But by changing the the FC, so think about it, I was holding up my

187
0:20:03,600 --> 0:20:08,960
hands like Nixon, you know, and the fingertips are the binding part, but down by my hand,

188
0:20:08,960 --> 0:20:13,520
that's the fragment crystallizable part. You can adjust that and change the half life. So you can

189
0:20:13,520 --> 0:20:18,160
potentially have an antibody that instead of only lasting three months, you might give this to

190
0:20:18,160 --> 0:20:25,120
someone and protect them for six months. So they not only have ongoing efficacy trials such as this,

191
0:20:25,120 --> 0:20:29,760
but they also have prophylaxis trials. Can you get this ahead of time? And I didn't mention the

192
0:20:29,760 --> 0:20:34,800
variants and I mentioned E484K. And what I was going to say here is I really do not like the

193
0:20:34,800 --> 0:20:39,520
concept of variants and we keep talking about different parts of the world. I like to put this

194
0:20:39,520 --> 0:20:44,800
in my mind sort of the way I think about choosing treatment for an individual with HIV. I want to

195
0:20:44,800 --> 0:20:51,520
know what's the mutation and how does it affect my potential therapy, right? So I hate the E4H4K

196
0:20:52,320 --> 0:20:58,000
because we have evidence that that decreases the efficacy of the monoclonal bamblinibimab

197
0:20:58,000 --> 0:21:03,280
and in devimab. Thus, we're switching over to a lot of the cocktails and actually,

198
0:21:04,640 --> 0:21:08,640
this is because this is a lot of this is going out to our pro health doctors. We've started

199
0:21:08,640 --> 0:21:15,680
sending our patients to the Catholic ERs to get access to the Regeneron monoclonals,

200
0:21:16,320 --> 0:21:21,920
the cocktail there. We've also been in talks to try to switch over all our UHG programs to using

201
0:21:21,920 --> 0:21:28,400
the Eli Lilly cocktail instead of just bamblinibimab. So they'll be getting the bamblinibimab and

202
0:21:28,400 --> 0:21:33,760
the test of a map because I think we want to stay ahead of this. We don't want to give a therapy.

203
0:21:33,760 --> 0:21:41,040
We're a third of the time we might be ineffective. Daniel, for HIV, you do genotyping to figure out

204
0:21:41,040 --> 0:21:45,600
what to treat them with. Do you think that's coming for this? I actually am hoping we can do it

205
0:21:45,600 --> 0:21:50,160
rapidly enough, right? So I reached out to Yoshi, Steve, and David. I was like,

206
0:21:50,160 --> 0:21:55,440
so, by the way, can you create an assay for me? Because with HIV, we might start someone on

207
0:21:55,440 --> 0:21:59,600
treatment. They come back the next week and we have the sequence and then we adjust treatment.

208
0:21:59,600 --> 0:22:04,160
But we need to know the sequence now, right? And so people may not know this, but this is

209
0:22:04,160 --> 0:22:10,240
fascinating. Someone with HIV, when I am designing their treatment, I get the sequence of the reverse

210
0:22:10,240 --> 0:22:16,320
transcriptase, the integrase, and the protease. And I base therapy on knowing the sequence of the

211
0:22:16,320 --> 0:22:21,280
HIV virus that is dominantly affecting them. And it's fascinating. And I think that when we look at

212
0:22:21,280 --> 0:22:26,320
monoclonals, there's two approaches. One is we keep regional surveillance and we use cocktails.

213
0:22:26,320 --> 0:22:30,960
The other would be rapid, maybe it's CRISPR-based, where we can figure out, are those relevant

214
0:22:30,960 --> 0:22:36,880
mutations prevalent present in that individual and then adjust therapy based upon real-time

215
0:22:36,880 --> 0:22:44,160
answers. The period of detectable viral replication, the viral symptom phase, another press release,

216
0:22:44,160 --> 0:22:52,640
right, from Merck. And this was Merck Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, and well, so Ridgeback Biotherapeutics

217
0:22:52,640 --> 0:22:57,280
and Merck announced preliminary findings from a Phase 2A trial of investigational COVID-19

218
0:22:57,280 --> 0:23:05,600
therapeutic malnup peer-avir. So this is an oral form of a potent ribonucleoside analog, right?

219
0:23:05,600 --> 0:23:13,520
So this is an oral antiviral. And they reported the results from a multi-center U.S. Phase 2A study.

220
0:23:13,520 --> 0:23:20,480
They were looking at 202 non-hospitalized patients. They were giving this within the first seven days

221
0:23:20,480 --> 0:23:27,200
of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. And the primary efficacy objective was reduction in time

222
0:23:27,840 --> 0:23:35,040
to viral negativity as measured by RTPCR. And they described results of the secondary endpoint,

223
0:23:35,040 --> 0:23:42,080
which was reduction in days to negativity of infectious virus isolated in days of pharyngeal

224
0:23:42,080 --> 0:23:47,680
swabs. And they actually did this by isolation in Bureau cell line culture. So I knew that you

225
0:23:47,680 --> 0:23:53,920
would like that Vincent actually did some viral culture there. So there were basically some

226
0:23:53,920 --> 0:23:59,520
in some encouraging data here. So we'll see going forward, we're hoping we can have something like

227
0:23:59,520 --> 0:24:07,280
an oral effective antiviral as opposed to where we currently sit with, shall I say, a relatively

228
0:24:07,280 --> 0:24:15,680
ineffective IV antiviral. All right, there were some Ivermectin, effective Ivermectin on time to

229
0:24:15,680 --> 0:24:20,960
resolution of symptoms among adults with mild COVID-19, a randomized clinical trial published

230
0:24:20,960 --> 0:24:28,240
in JAMA. Double mind, double blind randomized trial conducted at a single site in Cali, Colombia.

231
0:24:28,800 --> 0:24:35,600
They enrolled 476 adult patients with mild disease symptoms for seven days or fewer.

232
0:24:36,240 --> 0:24:41,600
And this was a one-to-one randomization, either receiving Ivermectin, 300 micrograms

233
0:24:41,600 --> 0:24:47,840
per kilogram per day for five days or placebo. And the primary outcome was timed resolution of

234
0:24:47,840 --> 0:24:55,440
symptoms within a 21-day period of follow-up. The median time resolution symptoms was 10 days

235
0:24:55,440 --> 0:25:02,000
in the Ivermectin group compared to 12 days in the placebo group. Hazard ratio resolution of symptoms,

236
0:25:02,000 --> 0:25:10,320
not really significant here. By day 21, 82% in the Ivermectin group, 79% of the placebo group

237
0:25:10,320 --> 0:25:16,880
had resolved symptoms. So they concluded in the study that among adults with mild COVID-19,

238
0:25:16,880 --> 0:25:22,400
a five-day course of Ivermectin, compared with placebo, did not significantly improve the time

239
0:25:23,040 --> 0:25:28,880
to resolution of symptoms. And they went on to say, the findings do not support the use of

240
0:25:28,880 --> 0:25:36,880
Ivermectin for treatment of mild COVID-19. There are several issues with the study.

241
0:25:36,880 --> 0:25:40,960
Apparently, on October 20th, the lead pharmacist observed that there was a labeling error.

242
0:25:41,680 --> 0:25:46,080
And everyone was receiving Ivermectin. And no one was getting the placebo during this period of time.

243
0:25:47,360 --> 0:25:53,600
No biological data. Population was very young. There are a lot of ongoing trials. I'm just

244
0:25:53,600 --> 0:25:58,400
going to leave this as this did not support the use of Ivermectin. I want to spend a little time

245
0:25:58,400 --> 0:26:03,120
in the future when I get more data on flu voxamine, just because I know a lot of people are discussing

246
0:26:03,120 --> 0:26:09,520
this. And as we get more data, I'm going to jump in and talk about that. I love the idea of early

247
0:26:09,520 --> 0:26:15,600
oral options. The tail phase and long COVID. I'm actually going to spend a lot of time. This is a

248
0:26:15,600 --> 0:26:21,040
longer section than usual. And I know long COVID is not as exciting as the variants.

249
0:26:22,320 --> 0:26:27,040
But the long COVID population, I feel like I've really become committed to this population.

250
0:26:27,680 --> 0:26:32,160
And there was a paper. Shane Crotty doesn't like this paper, just as a disclaimer.

251
0:26:32,160 --> 0:26:38,880
COVID symptoms, symptom clusters and predictors were becoming a long-hauler looking for clarity

252
0:26:38,880 --> 0:26:45,280
in the haze of the pandemic. And this was posted as a preprint. And the authors described 1,407

253
0:26:45,280 --> 0:26:52,240
long haulers that had never required hospitalization for COVID-19. And they reported that there were

254
0:26:52,240 --> 0:26:58,400
certain characteristics that were more likely to be seen in long haulers, such as female sex,

255
0:26:58,400 --> 0:27:06,000
normal BMI. And these were more likely to become long haulers. And this was interesting.

256
0:27:06,000 --> 0:27:14,240
They suggested that as many as 32% of the long haulers had an initial infection that was asymptomatic.

257
0:27:15,040 --> 0:27:22,320
Certainly a lot of limitations here. But as one analyzes this paper, it's interesting.

258
0:27:22,320 --> 0:27:28,160
I'm not going to hang my hat certainly on 32%. But this is actually something that we're seeing

259
0:27:28,160 --> 0:27:32,880
in clinical practice, something I've seen in clinical practice, where individuals come in.

260
0:27:32,880 --> 0:27:39,360
There's no clear acute COVID. As we dig in a little, we get a potential exposure that was

261
0:27:39,360 --> 0:27:45,520
maybe a few weeks or a month before the onset of these symptoms. And then we get a positive

262
0:27:45,520 --> 0:27:51,680
antibody test. So I do think, and I would say my clinical practice, I've seen people who I

263
0:27:51,680 --> 0:27:59,120
certainly feel comfortable diagnosing as long haulers, having long COVID, who did not have a

264
0:27:59,120 --> 0:28:04,080
symptomatic acute illness. But then later on, started to develop all the classic symptoms,

265
0:28:04,080 --> 0:28:09,040
loss of smell, loss of taste, the hair may have fallen out, the fatigue, the brain fog.

266
0:28:09,760 --> 0:28:14,160
And I think it will be interesting too, with the T cell test to see if those people who are

267
0:28:14,160 --> 0:28:21,120
serology negative have evidence of T cell response. Here's the big thing I am getting. We are all

268
0:28:21,120 --> 0:28:28,160
getting lots of questions about upcoming gatherings, Passover and Easter. And I actually got one

269
0:28:28,160 --> 0:28:33,200
text. I thought it was funny. It was a, it was sort of a news article. Well, it was a news article

270
0:28:33,200 --> 0:28:38,320
in the CDC updated guidelines and the text was, is this real or fake news? Are they really going

271
0:28:38,320 --> 0:28:43,280
to let people vaccinated get together indoors with people without masks? So I thought it was

272
0:28:43,280 --> 0:28:48,240
entertaining. And so I'll hit it here. We do, as people probably have heard, this was discussed

273
0:28:48,240 --> 0:28:53,760
on the last wave. We now have the following recommendations from the CDC where they say,

274
0:28:54,400 --> 0:28:59,680
fully vaccinated people can visit with other fully vaccinated people indoors without wearing

275
0:28:59,680 --> 0:29:07,760
mask or physical distancing. Or they can visit with unvaccinated people from a single household

276
0:29:07,760 --> 0:29:14,560
who are at low risk for severe COVID-19 disease indoors without wearing masks or physical distancing.

277
0:29:14,560 --> 0:29:18,640
You know, this is really, I think, the part that a lot of people are asking me about.

278
0:29:18,640 --> 0:29:23,200
And there's certain assumptions here, which I'm going to say I'm not sure how comfortable I am

279
0:29:23,200 --> 0:29:30,160
with these assumptions. Because what is really someone at low risk for severe COVID-19? You know,

280
0:29:30,160 --> 0:29:35,840
I brought up with the children. You know, my son is 15. One of my daughters is 18. The other

281
0:29:35,840 --> 0:29:40,320
daughters 20. And I know there's a certain idea that we'll take the 15 year old who's on the younger

282
0:29:40,320 --> 0:29:46,800
side. You know, if he got COVID, he loves running. Sports are a really big thing for him.

283
0:29:47,680 --> 0:29:52,320
If he, you know, he runs a five something minute mile as a freshman in high school,

284
0:29:52,320 --> 0:29:58,720
if he was not able to do that, that would be a huge blow. So I don't just look at him and say,

285
0:29:58,720 --> 0:30:03,360
I'm worried about him ending up in the hospital. I'm dying. I'm worried that he might, you know,

286
0:30:03,360 --> 0:30:08,800
really have long COVID if he might have a negative impact. So, you know, we need to really sort of

287
0:30:08,800 --> 0:30:13,040
think about these decisions here. So just putting that out there.

288
0:30:13,040 --> 0:30:18,080
As per the CDC currently authorized vaccines, the US are highly effective. Like what are we

289
0:30:18,080 --> 0:30:22,800
doing here? They're highly effective at protecting vaccinated people against symptomatic and severe

290
0:30:22,800 --> 0:30:30,000
COVID-19. And also there tends to be more evidence every day, a growing body of evidence,

291
0:30:30,000 --> 0:30:34,960
suggesting that fully vaccinated people are less likely to have asymptomatic infection

292
0:30:34,960 --> 0:30:42,080
and potentially less likely to transmit SARS-CoV-2 to others. So I think that that's at least what

293
0:30:42,080 --> 0:30:47,840
the CDC puts forward is what is the thinking behind this? So I don't want to give any specific

294
0:30:47,840 --> 0:30:54,880
advice, you know, on a case-by-case on Twiv, but I certainly do all day over the phone and in person.

295
0:30:55,760 --> 0:31:01,200
But we often get the questions about, you know, how do we make things safe, right? People are

296
0:31:01,200 --> 0:31:06,240
going to get together over Easter and pass over much as they did over the Christmas and New York

297
0:31:06,240 --> 0:31:13,360
holidays. So what are the different factors that can play into your decision? So one,

298
0:31:13,360 --> 0:31:20,160
being vaccinated, that's the biggest thing I can recommend. If you have access to vaccination,

299
0:31:20,800 --> 0:31:26,720
go ahead and get vaccinated. The vaccination access is improving dramatically and quickly.

300
0:31:26,720 --> 0:31:32,480
I hate that we're on a clock here. The other is people who've had prior recent infection in the

301
0:31:32,480 --> 0:31:38,560
last three months, they seem to be less likely. And that also relates to people who have recently

302
0:31:38,560 --> 0:31:44,800
received monoclonal. So that's sort of your lowest risk group. The other is group size.

303
0:31:45,520 --> 0:31:51,680
We know that the smaller the size, the better. So if you can keep these sizes small, you know,

304
0:31:51,680 --> 0:31:56,400
think about that. We are really getting here to the end of the pandemic. I mean, I've been saying

305
0:31:56,400 --> 0:32:00,320
that for a little while now, hopefully just a little while. But really, we have turned the corner.

306
0:32:00,320 --> 0:32:04,960
The numbers are dropping. The percentages are dropping. I think that we're all hearing that,

307
0:32:04,960 --> 0:32:10,240
hey, by the end of May, everyone who wants access to a vaccine in the United States will probably

308
0:32:10,240 --> 0:32:15,360
have had that shot. So this is the final lap. Think about that question that I brought up with

309
0:32:15,360 --> 0:32:20,320
children. I know they may not end up in the hospital. They may not die. They may be at lower risk for

310
0:32:20,320 --> 0:32:25,360
those. But you know, they are not, you know, I feel bad when those parents come in and say,

311
0:32:25,360 --> 0:32:31,840
how come no one told me? You know, children can get sick. Children can have long COVID outdoors

312
0:32:31,840 --> 0:32:37,200
versus indoors. It's a beautiful sunny day here in the New York, tri-state areas we record.

313
0:32:37,920 --> 0:32:43,840
Outdoors versus indoors. Time outside. We now think we've been saying this for a while. The data

314
0:32:43,840 --> 0:32:51,280
tends to hold about 20 times safer than indoors outdoors. So much better testing. Don't forget

315
0:32:51,280 --> 0:32:58,320
about testing, right? Testing is not perfect. But as we saw around Thanksgiving, around Christmas,

316
0:32:58,320 --> 0:33:04,320
around New Year's, around Hanukkah, if you test and you pick up people who are positive, you can

317
0:33:04,320 --> 0:33:09,360
pull them out. You can, you know, just these are layers of making things safe. Behaviors, right?

318
0:33:09,360 --> 0:33:13,200
Alcohol and hugging. I think that's what everyone's looking for too. Drinking alcohol and hugging

319
0:33:13,200 --> 0:33:18,160
everyone. These are factors that weigh in. Community prevalence. You got to pay attention. I have to

320
0:33:18,160 --> 0:33:23,600
say right here in Nassau County, where I'm out here recording, we're not doing well. And we're not

321
0:33:23,600 --> 0:33:29,120
doing well around kids as far as the prevalence levels. So your local community prevalence,

322
0:33:29,120 --> 0:33:34,960
the community prevalence where the people attending are coming from, that impacts the risk. Health

323
0:33:34,960 --> 0:33:41,520
status and risk factors for the attendees. You know, that needs to be factored in. If you've got

324
0:33:41,520 --> 0:33:45,680
someone who's undergoing chemo, do you really want to get together now or do you want to wait

325
0:33:45,680 --> 0:33:51,520
until prevalence drops and vaccinations more widespread? And then of course the behaviors before

326
0:33:51,520 --> 0:33:57,440
and after the event. I know a lot of us are exhausted. We're done with this pandemic. We just want to

327
0:33:57,440 --> 0:34:02,000
quote unquote get back to normal. But if you are thinking about getting together for these

328
0:34:02,000 --> 0:34:07,520
holidays, another layer of protection is really minimizing your exposures, you know, before the

329
0:34:07,520 --> 0:34:12,400
event. And then, you know, consider that if this was a potential exposure, how are you going to

330
0:34:12,400 --> 0:34:17,920
behave after the event? So I'm going to finish there. And then I'm going to say, hey, unless you're

331
0:34:17,920 --> 0:34:23,280
driving, drop everything you're doing, go to parasiteswithoutporters.com, continue to support

332
0:34:23,280 --> 0:34:29,200
us. Thank you so much. You know, we are going to continue during February, March and April to

333
0:34:29,200 --> 0:34:35,280
support the American Society of Tropical Medicine. We are hoping to get up to a donation of $40,000

334
0:34:35,280 --> 0:34:43,760
to give to them. Because we want to help early career women from low income parts of the world

335
0:34:43,760 --> 0:34:47,760
come to the fall meeting. Hopefully that's going to be safe and this is going to happen.

336
0:34:48,320 --> 0:34:53,280
Because there are a lot of inequities. I think everyone has there's been a light shown on the

337
0:34:53,280 --> 0:34:57,200
inequities in the world. We want to turn that around in the field of global health. And we want

338
0:34:57,200 --> 0:35:01,440
to give these young women from these parts of the world an opportunity help us make that happen.

339
0:35:01,440 --> 0:35:07,520
All right, it's time for Ask Dr. Griffin. If you want to ask a question, Daniel at microbe.tv.

340
0:35:08,160 --> 0:35:14,400
First one is from Douglas, who is an emergency physician in California. He says, you're very

341
0:35:14,400 --> 0:35:19,680
enthusiastic about the use of monoclonals. But my take is that it's marginally at best

342
0:35:19,680 --> 0:35:25,920
for preventing significant complications of COVID-19 with the best data showing an NNT of about 20

343
0:35:25,920 --> 0:35:30,240
to prevent an emergency department visit or hospitalization and larger studies showing

344
0:35:30,240 --> 0:35:34,960
no clinically relevant outcomes. Is there something I'm missing? I realized the recent press release

345
0:35:34,960 --> 0:35:42,000
for BAM and Etsy reported a significant hospitalization of death and patients recently diagnosed.

346
0:35:42,000 --> 0:35:46,880
I would assume they did not find a statistically significant decrease in death alone. Otherwise,

347
0:35:46,880 --> 0:35:52,720
the press relief would have mentioned it. The IDSA currently does not endorse use of these drugs.

348
0:35:52,720 --> 0:35:57,680
While I have been working on getting monoclonals for our Medicaid patients primarily on the basis

349
0:35:57,680 --> 0:36:03,760
of health equity, I'm not sure it's worth the effort and cost $1,275 infusion fee that our

350
0:36:03,760 --> 0:36:11,600
hospital charges for are uninsured. This perfect timing, thank you for writing in now. I got to

351
0:36:11,600 --> 0:36:16,480
just present the phase three data. I've been hearing that this phase three data was going to come out,

352
0:36:16,480 --> 0:36:20,480
and Vincent and I actually were on a call on Sunday with where people from Regeneron were

353
0:36:20,480 --> 0:36:25,120
saying their phase three data is going to come out. I've been getting a lot of personal communication

354
0:36:25,120 --> 0:36:31,440
and actually, as the PI on the largest post-EUA BAM on Evan map trial, which now I think is going

355
0:36:31,440 --> 0:36:38,800
to transform into a Eli Lilly Cocktail trial, we've been seeing really incredible impact.

356
0:36:38,800 --> 0:36:43,600
Just to give a story on this so people can put it in, we can get some numbers in here.

357
0:36:44,480 --> 0:36:52,000
My partner, Nujali, got consulted a patient. Day three of illness, their son had the COVID.

358
0:36:52,000 --> 0:36:58,160
This gentleman comes in dehydrated, hasn't had anything to eat or drink for a couple of days,

359
0:36:59,040 --> 0:37:06,000
gets IV hydration, not hypoxic, high risk in his 80s, multiple medical conditions.

360
0:37:06,640 --> 0:37:11,920
Her advice was we got to get this person out of the hospital, out of the ER, let's get them the

361
0:37:11,920 --> 0:37:20,000
monoclonal cocktail. As we just saw from the phase three data from Eli Lilly, really impressive going

362
0:37:20,000 --> 0:37:25,920
from a, we'll say it was a six percent people moving forward ending in the hospital to less than

363
0:37:25,920 --> 0:37:32,160
one percent. If you look at this individual, he probably has probably about 20% chance of ending

364
0:37:32,160 --> 0:37:39,600
up in the hospital. You reduce that from 20% down to, we'll say a five percent or a four percent,

365
0:37:39,600 --> 0:37:45,280
that's pretty impressive. What we were seeing out of the mail and now boom, we have this in this

366
0:37:45,280 --> 0:37:52,240
phase three trial, nobody receiving the cocktails died. We're seeing a big mortality reduction.

367
0:37:52,960 --> 0:37:56,320
When you look at the cost, that's what they basically, I've said, that's how they're pricing

368
0:37:56,320 --> 0:38:00,880
the drugs. They're saying if you target a population with a 10 percent likelihood of ending up in the

369
0:38:00,880 --> 0:38:07,200
hospital and you can drop that by 75 percent, now I'm going to say 85 percent, that makes that

370
0:38:07,200 --> 0:38:16,080
thousand dollar cost of the monoclonal cocktail makes sense. It actually saves a healthcare system.

371
0:38:16,080 --> 0:38:21,680
It saves an insurance company. It saves Medicare and Medicaid money versus the hospitalization.

372
0:38:21,680 --> 0:38:27,520
Also, here we are. This is the most effective therapy that we have. This has a mortality

373
0:38:28,080 --> 0:38:33,600
reduction, pretty significant. This has a huge impact on progression. If you interact with

374
0:38:33,600 --> 0:38:38,320
people that have gotten these treatments, instead of being sick for weeks and maybe being chronically

375
0:38:38,320 --> 0:38:43,920
ill, maybe getting long COVID, 10 to 20 percent of the time, we are seeing that these patients at 36

376
0:38:43,920 --> 0:38:50,000
hours are, most of them saying, I feel tremendously better if they got this in time. Instead, the

377
0:38:50,000 --> 0:38:55,040
push from the ER doc for my partner, Anu Jalee, was we got to get this person in the hospital,

378
0:38:55,040 --> 0:39:01,360
kind of started by Remdesivir. Her response was, hey, it's day three. They're not hypoxic.

379
0:39:01,360 --> 0:39:09,600
And by the way, Remdesivir, I'm not sure it ever saved anyone's life. I think the data is really

380
0:39:09,600 --> 0:39:15,840
impressive here. I've been waiting for this to be now. It's out there. I think it's just a matter

381
0:39:15,840 --> 0:39:21,280
of time before the Regeneron joins, and we get much more use and appreciation of the monoclonals.

382
0:39:21,280 --> 0:39:26,720
Al is an ID doc in Canada due to the delayed vaccine rollout here from international supply

383
0:39:26,720 --> 0:39:31,760
restrictions. Our province recently moved to delay the second shot of mRNA vaccines for four months,

384
0:39:31,760 --> 0:39:36,800
citing UK and Israel data for effectiveness after a single shot. Many frontline workers

385
0:39:36,800 --> 0:39:41,760
who see COVID patients, including myself, have now had their second shot canceled.

386
0:39:41,760 --> 0:39:46,800
I'm aware of the UK and Israeli data. I myself feel like we are playing with fire doing this,

387
0:39:46,800 --> 0:39:51,280
having a large unboosted population. Seems like a good way of developing escape variants,

388
0:39:51,280 --> 0:39:55,840
as well as not adequately protecting frontline healthcare workers. I'm really curious

389
0:39:55,840 --> 0:39:59,920
what an outsider's perspective would be on this, as it's very difficult to voice a

390
0:39:59,920 --> 0:40:04,320
clinician's perspective over very tightly controlled public health messaging.

391
0:40:04,320 --> 0:40:06,800
Now, Vincent, this is from Canada. Is that right? Did I get that right?

392
0:40:06,800 --> 0:40:08,160
That's right. That's right.

393
0:40:08,160 --> 0:40:12,320
Okay, good. Good. I feel comfortable criticizing the Canadians there,

394
0:40:12,320 --> 0:40:17,360
not very violent people. So I want to make sure it wasn't some nationality that I would get in

395
0:40:17,360 --> 0:40:27,040
trouble. Yeah, I do not. That's exactly my fear. I worry about selection for variants when you have

396
0:40:27,040 --> 0:40:32,320
a low level of antibodies. This is like giving someone a half a dose of an antibiotic every

397
0:40:32,320 --> 0:40:37,840
other day or basically trying to create selection pressure. I know Paul Bines put out an opinion

398
0:40:37,840 --> 0:40:43,520
piece on this. And I actually, that is a fear I have. So yeah, not excited about that approach.

399
0:40:43,520 --> 0:40:48,080
Miles writes, my daughter-in-law is pregnant. First time, 11 and a half weeks, does the lower

400
0:40:48,080 --> 0:40:54,000
react to genicity of J&J vaccine make it safer for her? At what point should she get vaccinated?

401
0:40:54,000 --> 0:40:59,200
Yes, that's a challenging question I have to say. I'm very careful to say the best vaccine

402
0:40:59,200 --> 0:41:03,600
is the one that you have access to, because if you say, oh, but I can get J&J in two months,

403
0:41:04,320 --> 0:41:09,520
that's not great. If you went in and say, hey, I got either one, I could take the J&J,

404
0:41:09,520 --> 0:41:15,120
I could take the mRNA. There is some suggestion, pregnant women, you really don't want them having

405
0:41:15,120 --> 0:41:22,000
fevers. So is there certain advantage, the J&J, because of less likelihood of having fever?

406
0:41:22,800 --> 0:41:28,400
There's two sides to this, let's say, as far as safety experience. We now have had

407
0:41:28,400 --> 0:41:34,400
millions of people get the mRNA vaccines, tens of thousands of pregnant women. They all seem to

408
0:41:34,400 --> 0:41:41,360
be doing really well. The J&J platform was used in West Africa, down to as young as four months of

409
0:41:41,360 --> 0:41:46,560
age. A lot of pregnant women, we have a long experience, sort of afterwards seeing that there

410
0:41:46,560 --> 0:41:53,520
were no issues. There's really no significant concerns in my mind to any of the vaccines with

411
0:41:53,520 --> 0:41:59,360
pregnant women. So I think I'm just going to circle right back, as I did here to say,

412
0:41:59,360 --> 0:42:04,560
a lot, a lot of evidence that these are safe, effective, and the thing you don't want to be

413
0:42:04,560 --> 0:42:08,080
is unvaccinated during a pandemic, particularly if you're pregnant.

414
0:42:09,280 --> 0:42:14,560
Last one is from Gary. Can you tell me what it means that Janssen COVID vaccine protects

415
0:42:14,560 --> 0:42:20,560
85% against severe disease and 100% against hospitalization? I thought severe disease

416
0:42:20,560 --> 0:42:26,160
meant requires hospitalization. What severe COVID does not require hospitalization?

417
0:42:26,160 --> 0:42:34,560
So yeah, I think that we need to all use words a little bit better here, a little bit more specific.

418
0:42:35,760 --> 0:42:40,560
Yeah, it's interesting that we were having a discussion. One of the local hospitals really

419
0:42:40,560 --> 0:42:46,720
wants to basically shorten the amount of isolation to 10 days from symptom onset, sort of no matter

420
0:42:46,720 --> 0:42:52,320
what. And I was actually pointing out that the definition by the CDC of severe is someone who

421
0:42:52,320 --> 0:42:56,880
requires hospitalization and supplemental oxygen, like, no, no, when I say severe, I mean they're

422
0:42:56,880 --> 0:43:01,840
on a ventilator, which basically means no one's going to end up with any more than 10 days of

423
0:43:01,840 --> 0:43:08,400
isolation. So if you went through and actually this was done, I think pretty well on Twib,

424
0:43:08,400 --> 0:43:13,680
I feel like Rich was sort of struggling with this. How are you using these words? And if you have,

425
0:43:13,680 --> 0:43:18,800
you know, a positive PCR and two symptoms, then I think ultimately what I did is I walked away

426
0:43:18,800 --> 0:43:22,560
and said, I'm going to forget this confusing terminology and I'm going to ask the really important

427
0:43:22,560 --> 0:43:29,200
question. Day 28, did anyone end up requiring hospitalization? Did anyone die? And the answer

428
0:43:29,200 --> 0:43:35,200
was zero in the vaccinated group. So 100% of preventing people from ending up in the hospital,

429
0:43:35,200 --> 0:43:41,280
100% of people keep them from dying of COVID. And that in my mind, that's that's moderate to

430
0:43:41,280 --> 0:43:47,120
severe COVID. If you can stay in the outpatient setting, if it's nothing more than the sniffles

431
0:43:47,120 --> 0:43:53,440
that are fever and you feel crummy, that's success. All right, that is COVID-19 clinical update number

432
0:43:53,440 --> 0:44:23,280
53 with Dr. Daniel Griffin. Thank you, Daniel. Oh, thank you so much. Everyone take care and be safe.
