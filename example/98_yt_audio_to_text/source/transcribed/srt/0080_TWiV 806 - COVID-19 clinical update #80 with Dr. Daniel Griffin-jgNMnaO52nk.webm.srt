0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:06,880
This week in virology, the podcast about viruses, the kind that make you sick.

2
0:00:10,240 --> 0:00:20,480
From Microbe TV, this is Twiv, this week in virology, episode 806 recorded on September 16th, 2021.

3
0:00:21,200 --> 0:00:26,880
I'm Vincent Rackeniello, and you're listening to the podcast all about viruses. Joining me

4
0:00:26,880 --> 0:00:34,400
today from New York, Daniel Griffin. Hello, everyone. This is clinical update number 80,

5
0:00:35,680 --> 0:00:43,520
and I have a question for you at the onset here, Daniel. This is an easy one. In the past

6
0:00:43,520 --> 0:00:47,520
week, since we've spoken, what are the numbers looking like in the New York area?

7
0:00:49,600 --> 0:00:53,440
The case numbers, and I think you could say this across the country, if you look at numbers,

8
0:00:53,440 --> 0:00:59,760
we seem like we've sort of crested a little bit of a hump as far as cases. You look at deaths

9
0:00:59,760 --> 0:01:07,280
nationally, not great, but again, we sort of talk about that lagging indicator. Here in the New

10
0:01:07,280 --> 0:01:14,960
York area, and I'll kind of hit on this, we've been seeing only deaths about 40, 44, sort of

11
0:01:14,960 --> 0:01:21,600
right around 40, low 40s. You can just think of how different that was from deaths back above

12
0:01:21,600 --> 0:01:29,520
2000 a day in the New York area. So I will say, the hospitals, a few COVID cases in the hospitals,

13
0:01:30,160 --> 0:01:34,560
in a highly vaccinated population, particularly in Nassau County, where I see a lot of folks,

14
0:01:35,680 --> 0:01:44,400
vaccines have transformed COVID from an ICU from a hospital disease to a largely outpatient disease.

15
0:01:44,400 --> 0:01:51,280
I had a call yesterday from a clinician colleague of mine, and he's saying, you know, Dan, I just

16
0:01:51,920 --> 0:01:55,120
not feeling so great. I think it's just a call. I call my doctor, and he said, oh, it just sounds

17
0:01:55,120 --> 0:02:01,280
like a common cold. And I'm like, really, like maybe a common cold coronavirus, like SARS-CoV-2,

18
0:02:01,280 --> 0:02:06,320
after two shots of an mRNA vaccine. He's like, no, no, I talk to the doctor, and he doesn't

19
0:02:06,320 --> 0:02:13,920
sound like COVID. And I said, you know, according to my good friend, Lisa Santoriello, it's a viral

20
0:02:13,920 --> 0:02:18,480
disease. You realize that it can present just like a viral disease. The only way to tell whether or

21
0:02:18,480 --> 0:02:23,840
not what you have is COVID or not is to go get a test. And Vincent, can you guess what that test

22
0:02:23,840 --> 0:02:32,640
showed? I think it showed he was positive for SARS-CoV-2. Yes. So yes, it was positive, and you know,

23
0:02:32,640 --> 0:02:38,000
then he went ahead and test his wife, his family, and you know, and it's not going to be coming

24
0:02:38,000 --> 0:02:42,240
and doing consults with me for a little while till he finishes his isolation for the infected

25
0:02:42,240 --> 0:02:48,560
period. You know, that's interesting. But so in immunized people, it can present like a common

26
0:02:48,560 --> 0:02:53,120
cold, which is what the common cold coronas do in a largely immune population, right?

27
0:02:53,680 --> 0:02:57,120
It's really interesting, you know, and I know we've talked about this from the beginning, right?

28
0:02:57,120 --> 0:03:02,560
So if you got exposed to SARS-CoV-2 when you were younger, you know, would that, you know, be sort

29
0:03:02,560 --> 0:03:06,880
of different later in life, you know, sort of, you know, will, is this what will happen? Let's say

30
0:03:06,880 --> 0:03:11,440
parts of the world that have not been getting vaccines, you know, and what do we do sort of in

31
0:03:11,440 --> 0:03:16,400
the future? In the future, a lot of young kids, let's say in the first few years of life,

32
0:03:17,040 --> 0:03:22,960
get infected with SARS-CoV-2. What will sort of the future be there versus what we see now? Because

33
0:03:22,960 --> 0:03:28,480
I think we talked about with the other, the non-SARS-CoV-2, the common coronaviruses,

34
0:03:29,280 --> 0:03:34,080
you know, and I want people to quickly think and they name those. By the time you're six years old,

35
0:03:34,080 --> 0:03:40,320
the majority of us have been infected. So it tends to be in that first like, you know, under five,

36
0:03:40,320 --> 0:03:45,040
so be interesting to see over time. But, you know, I always like to say too to put that in context,

37
0:03:45,040 --> 0:03:49,360
vaccines are like sunblock, right? You can't get vaccinated and then lay there on the beach at

38
0:03:49,360 --> 0:03:54,960
the tropics naked all day, you know, they reduce our chances. And so my colleague is fortunate

39
0:03:54,960 --> 0:03:58,720
that for him it was a mild case. But unfortunately, you know, when we hear the death numbers,

40
0:03:58,720 --> 0:04:02,560
a few of those deaths every day, a number of those deaths every day, are in the vaccinated

41
0:04:02,560 --> 0:04:07,680
who have other risk factors who couldn't mount that robust immune system. All right, let's start

42
0:04:07,680 --> 0:04:14,720
with my quotation and I don't know if people know I am recording this on Yam Kapoor. And it is,

43
0:04:14,720 --> 0:04:22,720
it will not be sundown until 701 here in New York. So my son Barnaby has some friends. He calls it

44
0:04:22,720 --> 0:04:29,120
an intimate gathering daddy. It's just a few of us. It's not a super spreader event. So, you know,

45
0:04:29,120 --> 0:04:34,480
we were basically figuring out that they were not allowed to eat until 701. And my wife was like,

46
0:04:34,480 --> 0:04:39,600
but they're boys. I'm like, they can wait. They can wait. So for those of you who, you know,

47
0:04:39,600 --> 0:04:45,120
I guess listen to this on Saturday, I hope that your fast was a good and gentle one.

48
0:04:46,640 --> 0:04:54,720
But our quotation from Eli Weisel, the opposite of love is not hate. It's indifference. The opposite

49
0:04:54,720 --> 0:05:01,040
of art is not ugliness. It's indifference. The opposite of faith is not heresy. It's indifference.

50
0:05:01,040 --> 0:05:06,960
And the opposite of life is not death. It's indifference. When I graduated medical school,

51
0:05:06,960 --> 0:05:13,360
Eli Weisel was still alive and actually spoke at Carnegie Hall at our medical school graduation

52
0:05:13,360 --> 0:05:19,040
from NYU. And maybe as we get a little farther, I might throw in a little bit of the wisdom that

53
0:05:19,040 --> 0:05:25,200
he shared. You know, at the time it ruffled my feathers, so to speak, in my young arrogant,

54
0:05:25,200 --> 0:05:31,120
you know, finishing medical school, but really a wise man and a loss that he's no longer with us.

55
0:05:31,120 --> 0:05:38,160
All right. You know, the update, I gave a little bit of an update right there, but I'm actually

56
0:05:38,160 --> 0:05:45,120
going to go ahead and introduce a preprint right here in my update because I think it introduces a

57
0:05:45,120 --> 0:05:49,280
really important concept when we're trying to understand what is going on around us.

58
0:05:50,240 --> 0:05:58,160
And this was the preprint, the COVID-19 hospitalization metric in the pre and post vaccination eras

59
0:05:58,160 --> 0:06:05,680
as a measure of pandemic severity, the retrospective nationwide cohort study. Now there was actually,

60
0:06:05,680 --> 0:06:12,240
I think it was an Atlantic article that discussed this and I spoke to the author before he published

61
0:06:12,240 --> 0:06:19,120
his piece. But here in this preprint, the author suggests that there may be limitations at just

62
0:06:19,120 --> 0:06:25,120
looking at hospital numbers if one does not ask for a little more detail or dare I say nuance.

63
0:06:25,120 --> 0:06:31,120
This was, I think, a really smart, really clever the way these researchers went about trying to

64
0:06:31,120 --> 0:06:36,000
look at this data. So the investigators used the electronic records from the healthcare system

65
0:06:36,000 --> 0:06:44,640
of the US Department of Veteran Affairs and looked for March 1, 2020 through June 30, 2021.

66
0:06:44,640 --> 0:06:56,800
And they included 47,742 admissions. They then identified 38,508 unique patients with laboratory

67
0:06:56,800 --> 0:07:05,520
confirmed SARS-CoV-2. And then a subset of this, they identified 28,731 that met the criteria for

68
0:07:05,520 --> 0:07:12,640
moderate to severe COVID-19. Now what does that mean? They defined moderate to severe, I'm going to

69
0:07:12,640 --> 0:07:19,760
say properly defined, moderate to severe COVID-19 disease, as a person who has a documented

70
0:07:19,760 --> 0:07:26,400
oxygen saturation of less than 94%. So they were looking at these inpatient hospitalizations,

71
0:07:26,400 --> 0:07:30,800
they were able to look through and see if they could find that that occurred during the admission.

72
0:07:31,600 --> 0:07:36,880
And then they really looked at what percentage of these COVID-19 folks that were hospitalized

73
0:07:36,880 --> 0:07:42,640
actually had this criteria, right? And we've talked about this before. You have to be careful

74
0:07:42,640 --> 0:07:47,600
with geography. We talked about ICU. And putting someone in the ICU, there's a different threshold,

75
0:07:47,600 --> 0:07:52,240
I'll say here in the New York Tri-State area, than there was, for instance, at my first job when

76
0:07:52,240 --> 0:07:57,600
I was working at the VA in Helena, Montana. It was just me. It was the only guy there, the entire

77
0:07:57,600 --> 0:08:04,880
weekend, 100-bed hospital. People ended up in the ICU for closer observation with a lower threshold.

78
0:08:04,880 --> 0:08:07,600
I say, you didn't want to know. Are they in the ICU or not? You want to know, like, well,

79
0:08:07,600 --> 0:08:11,600
why are they in the ICU? Are they in the ICU because it's done all by himself or are they in the ICU

80
0:08:11,600 --> 0:08:17,920
because they really require that higher level of care? And what they report here is that prior

81
0:08:17,920 --> 0:08:26,560
to January 2021, right? So prior to when vaccines became available, 64% of folks admitted to the VA

82
0:08:27,440 --> 0:08:34,400
had that moderate to severe, had a documented saturation less than 94 versus 52%. So it fell

83
0:08:34,400 --> 0:08:41,520
about 12% in this later period. Most strikingly, if you look at the vaccinated patients,

84
0:08:41,520 --> 0:08:49,440
only 42.6%. So the minority of the vaccinated admissions had an oxygen saturation less than 94%.

85
0:08:50,640 --> 0:08:58,880
And only a 15.8% of those admitted vaccinated patients were sick enough that their physicians

86
0:08:58,880 --> 0:09:06,560
felt it was warranted to administer dexamethasone. So I think this has been sort of taken both ways

87
0:09:07,280 --> 0:09:12,960
on social media, apparently. Some people say, you're minimizing COVID. But what I think this

88
0:09:12,960 --> 0:09:19,440
actually is a reinforcement of the efficacy of vaccines like we talked about with my colleague,

89
0:09:19,440 --> 0:09:25,200
not all COVID-19 hospitalizations are the same. So if an individual gets vaccinated,

90
0:09:25,200 --> 0:09:29,760
they end up in the hospital, oh, my gosh, they must be so sick. Well, if their oxygen saturation is

91
0:09:29,760 --> 0:09:36,560
above 94%, they're there just for a 48 hour, you know, quick stay, not much more than observation.

92
0:09:36,560 --> 0:09:42,240
That is so much different than somebody ending up on high-fellow oxygen ending up in the ICU. So

93
0:09:43,120 --> 0:09:48,080
again, nuance when we look at those hospitalization rates, we want to really be asking, you know,

94
0:09:48,080 --> 0:09:52,800
what are we seeing here? Why are people being hospitalized and sort of getting that nuance there?

95
0:09:52,800 --> 0:10:01,520
But I will say, death is death, right? Despite all the nuance here, if you go ahead and you look at the

96
0:10:02,080 --> 0:10:07,760
at the world-o-meter dashboard, you know, how are we doing there? And I actually looked, you

97
0:10:07,760 --> 0:10:15,600
know, we could go and we recorded TWIV clinical update 79 that day over 2000. So 2,107 people had

98
0:10:15,600 --> 0:10:21,200
died that day. And if you go back to September 9th, you go back about a year ago, that number was

99
0:10:21,200 --> 0:10:27,920
1,072. So that's twice that number. But then if you look a little bit, again, a little granular,

100
0:10:27,920 --> 0:10:31,760
if you look at places with high vaccination rates, like here in New York, as Vincent and I were

101
0:10:31,760 --> 0:10:38,560
discussing, we're seeing about 40 deaths a day, right? If you go to Texas, you can imagine that

102
0:10:38,560 --> 0:10:45,280
count is much higher. And I just checked right before we recorded this. So yesterday, so not

103
0:10:45,280 --> 0:10:53,360
September 15th, 2,284 deaths for just one day. This is the issue, right? If you roll, if you

104
0:10:53,360 --> 0:10:58,080
remove the masks, remove all the non-pharmaceutical interventions, and you still have a large, and we

105
0:10:58,080 --> 0:11:03,440
still have a chunk of our population that is unvaccinated. Children, COVID, and mental health, right?

106
0:11:03,440 --> 0:11:08,160
Children are at risk for COVID, wearing a mask is less traumatic for a child than being hospitalized.

107
0:11:08,160 --> 0:11:14,800
You know, I went ahead and I looked at, and as I've sort of mentioned, the CDC has tracking the

108
0:11:14,800 --> 0:11:21,520
American Academy of Pediatrics has tracking. We're still seeing just an unacceptable number

109
0:11:21,520 --> 0:11:28,480
of children being infected here in the US per week. We're still in sort of that quarter million

110
0:11:28,480 --> 0:11:34,880
a week level. Now, I should say, so I'm part of this COVID kids consortium that was organized by

111
0:11:34,880 --> 0:11:39,440
Christie Short. She's a virologist down in Australia. I don't know if you mentioned you may know her.

112
0:11:40,080 --> 0:11:45,520
And this was sort of an interesting international group that Dr. Short put together. And our goal

113
0:11:45,520 --> 0:11:50,800
here is to provide meaningful data on COVID in children and adolescents, and really to look at

114
0:11:50,800 --> 0:11:57,200
not only high, but middle, low income countries with all the different quality data challenges

115
0:11:57,200 --> 0:12:01,760
in different settings. But after this last meeting, I was forwarded a pre-print, which I share with

116
0:12:01,760 --> 0:12:07,760
Vincent. I share with Amy. I asked a couple of other folks to look at this. And the pre-print

117
0:12:07,760 --> 0:12:15,440
was biological features of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children. And this pre-print certainly will

118
0:12:15,440 --> 0:12:20,960
benefit from the peer review process. I mean, there's a couple sort of painful things. They equate

119
0:12:20,960 --> 0:12:26,960
viral RNA copy number with viral load. I think we've been trying to point out that those are

120
0:12:26,960 --> 0:12:34,160
not equivalent. They do viral culture. They do assessment of sideopathic effects. They report

121
0:12:34,160 --> 0:12:40,160
semi-quantitative viral titers. And I thought it was worth a review and I look forward to it

122
0:12:40,160 --> 0:12:45,360
improving. But you know, some of the interesting things in here, the youngest kids do not have

123
0:12:45,360 --> 0:12:52,160
lower RNA copy numbers as assessed by RT-PCR. Lower age kids were not less likely to have

124
0:12:52,160 --> 0:12:57,680
cultural virus. It was really mostly in those first five days after symptom onset that virus

125
0:12:57,680 --> 0:13:03,440
could be cultured. The anterior nary samples looked like that was fine, right? We've talked about

126
0:13:03,440 --> 0:13:08,160
that before. So in a lot of ways, it's sort of confirming a lot of things that we've been saying,

127
0:13:08,160 --> 0:13:14,480
just really dispelling a lot of these early myths. But then maybe a few takeaways. You can in these

128
0:13:14,480 --> 0:13:18,240
children, particularly if you're going to be doing serial sampling, you can do the anterior

129
0:13:18,240 --> 0:13:24,080
naries. You do not need to do that beautiful, potentially painful, and traumatizing deep,

130
0:13:24,080 --> 0:13:31,440
blind, middle-turbinate brain biopsy swab. But again, this sort of supports, I think,

131
0:13:31,440 --> 0:13:36,080
that we really need to understand what's going on in children. And they're not some special class

132
0:13:36,080 --> 0:13:41,600
that when exposed does not get the virus. Children can get infected. Children can have

133
0:13:41,600 --> 0:13:47,520
replication-competent virus at high levels. So this is update 80. So hopefully something

134
0:13:47,520 --> 0:13:54,160
a little special here. The pre-exposure period, right? This is when we're all worried about

135
0:13:54,160 --> 0:14:01,280
transmission, exposure, what can we do? And I always say never miss an opportunity to test. And now,

136
0:14:01,280 --> 0:14:07,680
again, masks are cool. Hopefully people remember that because the CDC updated their mask guidance

137
0:14:07,680 --> 0:14:13,040
with some really nice graphics. And I have to say, it's still shocking to me that this far into

138
0:14:13,040 --> 0:14:19,440
the pandemic, people are still wearing masks incorrectly. I find when I walk around, I need

139
0:14:19,440 --> 0:14:23,520
to ask people, do we need to get you a lighter mask? It seems to be falling down. We need the

140
0:14:23,520 --> 0:14:29,840
kind with the helium to keep it above your nostrils. So just a little refresher here. And I'm actually,

141
0:14:29,840 --> 0:14:33,360
when we get to the end here, I'm going to bring out some samples. So maybe this will be the time

142
0:14:33,360 --> 0:14:38,720
people want to tune into YouTube to see some of the masks. So we talk about masks, but really what

143
0:14:38,720 --> 0:14:44,480
we're talking about and what the CDC highlights on their updated guidance, go to cdc.gov.

144
0:14:45,360 --> 0:14:51,920
Types of masks is sort of the end of the URL. And they talk about masks, right? These are designed

145
0:14:51,920 --> 0:14:57,920
to contain your respiratory droplets and particles. They're really source control. They provide only

146
0:14:57,920 --> 0:15:04,320
some protection for you, really mainly they're protecting others. I've used the surgeon analogy.

147
0:15:04,320 --> 0:15:08,880
He's got that. So he doesn't cough, spit, or infect the wound. He's not so much protecting

148
0:15:08,880 --> 0:15:13,920
himself and the patient. And the other side, respirators, right? We throw them in with masks.

149
0:15:14,720 --> 0:15:21,600
But these are really designed to protect the wearer from particles. And this is going to be

150
0:15:21,600 --> 0:15:28,960
something I will go through. They repeatedly in their guidance here, reference, nose wires, right?

151
0:15:28,960 --> 0:15:34,480
You want this mask to fit you properly. And maybe this is an opportunity. I would say this is

152
0:15:35,360 --> 0:15:39,840
mainly sort of started off as physicians listening. But every time you see a patient,

153
0:15:39,840 --> 0:15:46,400
here's your opportunity to teach them how to properly adjust that nose wire so that it fits

154
0:15:46,400 --> 0:15:51,440
properly. When I show the little props later, you can actually add a nose wire to a lot of masks.

155
0:15:51,440 --> 0:15:56,560
You can order these iron on. But you really want to make sure this fits properly. And they also

156
0:15:56,560 --> 0:16:02,960
come in a little bit about facial hair. We almost need Dixon here to show the issue with excessive

157
0:16:02,960 --> 0:16:08,880
facial hair, not just with masks, but also, you know, scratchy microphone issue. But I'm also

158
0:16:08,880 --> 0:16:13,600
going to do a little bit of a shout out for an organization. You know, they were talking about

159
0:16:13,600 --> 0:16:19,600
masks before anyone else was, perhaps. And this is an organization called the American Conference

160
0:16:19,600 --> 0:16:27,360
of Governmental Industrial Hygienesis, the A-C-G-I-H. And this organization is a 501c3. They've been

161
0:16:27,360 --> 0:16:33,440
around for over 80 years focusing on the advancement of occupational environmental health. And they

162
0:16:33,440 --> 0:16:37,520
actually have a really, I thought sort of a nice graphic where you get to add, you know,

163
0:16:37,520 --> 0:16:42,000
what if people around me are wearing masks? What if I'm wearing masks? What about the different

164
0:16:42,000 --> 0:16:47,520
masks? Sort of where does that put me from a safe point of view? But with that said, I'm going to

165
0:16:47,520 --> 0:16:53,440
reach behind me and grab my props vents. And I have several masks behind me. And they're looking

166
0:16:53,440 --> 0:16:58,720
at this CDC site and they have a page of all the different kinds of facial hair you could have.

167
0:16:59,280 --> 0:17:03,760
I didn't know. Isn't that great? I mean, you didn't realize all your options. So,

168
0:17:03,760 --> 0:17:07,520
I don't know if people are going to come away with a better understanding of the impact on

169
0:17:07,520 --> 0:17:14,880
masks or like new ideas for, you know, personal appearance. So, let me start off with sort of

170
0:17:14,880 --> 0:17:21,120
the bottom of the heat, my so-called, this is my cloth mask without a nose wire. So, I,

171
0:17:22,560 --> 0:17:26,880
and you can see I put that on. Maybe there's a little bit of decrease, but there's a lot of

172
0:17:26,880 --> 0:17:32,560
air coming up around the nose. So, we have our cloth mask. Now, our cloth masks are probably our,

173
0:17:32,560 --> 0:17:38,080
we'll say, least effective source control, least effective protection, right? So, that's our cloth

174
0:17:38,080 --> 0:17:44,480
mask. But the cloth mask can actually be improved by adding a nose wire and making sure that the

175
0:17:44,480 --> 0:17:54,400
mask is fitted better to your face. So, this is our famous Dr. Who. Masks are cool. And you can see

176
0:17:54,400 --> 0:17:58,400
here, if you're watching on YouTube, that there is this nose wire. You may want to go over to the

177
0:17:58,400 --> 0:18:02,880
mirror. You want to make sure that nose wire is bent so it goes sort of in and then flares out

178
0:18:02,880 --> 0:18:07,200
so you get a nice seal at the top. This is one of those examples you can put on your reading

179
0:18:07,200 --> 0:18:13,120
glasses, for instance. And you shouldn't see much of a fog, right? And as we go later, we'll try

180
0:18:13,120 --> 0:18:20,240
that again with some other masks. Now we move up, right? Those are truly masks. What is our last

181
0:18:20,240 --> 0:18:28,640
mask in the heap? And this is our surgical mask. And these are actually a material that actually has

182
0:18:28,640 --> 0:18:34,240
improved ability to create local source control. Again, it has the nose wire. Bring this up.

183
0:18:36,400 --> 0:18:41,680
And this is what you'll notice that physicians, that surgeons, that healthcare workers, nurses,

184
0:18:41,680 --> 0:18:46,080
nurses, a, it's really a lot of folks in the hospital wearing these almost at all times. A

185
0:18:46,080 --> 0:18:50,400
lot of hospitals, you have to wear them. I say almost at all times because people love to pull

186
0:18:50,400 --> 0:18:56,800
them off to speak and generate droplets, which, you know, I walk away quickly. And then we move

187
0:18:56,800 --> 0:19:06,320
from masks to respirators. The first is the KN95. And I know I've talked about this quite a bit.

188
0:19:06,320 --> 0:19:16,880
And you can see here, this is a KN95. It also has the built in metal. So again, you need to

189
0:19:16,880 --> 0:19:22,160
shape this can't just pop it on your face. And this actually creates a fairly reasonable

190
0:19:23,440 --> 0:19:30,720
seal. But again, this is a KN95. This does not necessarily meet US NIOSH standards, right? So

191
0:19:30,720 --> 0:19:37,360
the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. When we've studied these, which are

192
0:19:37,360 --> 0:19:42,560
actually approved, so the KN95 are sort of approved by, well, not kind of, they are approved by the

193
0:19:42,560 --> 0:19:52,240
Chinese, they are not quite as effective as the N95s. The N95s, let's hit that. And I have a

194
0:19:52,240 --> 0:19:58,160
couple here before we move on. So this first one here, and healthcare workers that are using

195
0:19:58,160 --> 0:20:03,360
N95s, these are actually fitted. We actually get tested. Since I work at several hospitals,

196
0:20:03,360 --> 0:20:12,960
I get tested everywhere. And you can see there the strap actually broke as I put this on. They're

197
0:20:12,960 --> 0:20:18,480
not, they're not necessarily designed for multi-use. These fit really close. And you'll actually

198
0:20:18,480 --> 0:20:25,040
notice that if I put my glasses on, not much fogging, right? And these are actually often

199
0:20:25,040 --> 0:20:31,840
designed, I'll pull this off, to vent the air away so it doesn't. And we have several options.

200
0:20:31,840 --> 0:20:38,960
Here's another one, sort of a flat duck bill, the 3M. This is my favorite. The N95s, these are

201
0:20:38,960 --> 0:20:44,080
actually made up to a highest standard. And now I have to say, to be honest, we have these made

202
0:20:44,080 --> 0:20:49,200
in the US. Supplies are better. Maybe I should say N95s, they're not just for healthcare workers

203
0:20:49,200 --> 0:20:54,560
anymore, echoing the serial commercials. But those are our choices. And I think this far into the

204
0:20:54,560 --> 0:21:00,720
pandemic, it's pretty obvious not only that masks work, but I think it's really critical

205
0:21:00,720 --> 0:21:05,920
that we understand masks, respirators, how to use them. And if you see a friend,

206
0:21:06,800 --> 0:21:11,760
or an enemy, or someone in between, not properly wearing that mask, you know, feel free to sort of

207
0:21:11,760 --> 0:21:16,400
help them. It's like someone with a crooked bow tie. I am sure they want you to help them out.

208
0:21:16,400 --> 0:21:25,920
And again, in the string of points making a line, we had another MMWR looking at the effectiveness

209
0:21:25,920 --> 0:21:33,600
of masks. And this was the MMWR report, SARS-CoV-2 transmission to masked and unmasked close

210
0:21:33,600 --> 0:21:40,880
contacts of university students with COVID-19, St. Louis, Missouri, January through May 2021.

211
0:21:40,880 --> 0:21:47,920
And just briefly, in this MMWR, they compared only masked exposures with close contacts

212
0:21:47,920 --> 0:21:53,200
with unmasked exposures, right? So you're exposed to someone who has SARS-CoV-2.

213
0:21:55,680 --> 0:22:00,720
What happens if you get exposed to someone as a mask or is unmasked? So this is source control.

214
0:22:01,440 --> 0:22:08,720
That unmasked every one of those unmasked exposures, they found a higher adjusted odds of a positive

215
0:22:08,720 --> 0:22:14,960
test. Each additional exposure was associated with a 40% increase in odds of a positive test.

216
0:22:14,960 --> 0:22:20,640
So just people keep asking like, oh, where's the data on masks? Lots of data. There's lots of

217
0:22:20,640 --> 0:22:27,440
points here in the line. All right, so moving away from masks back to testing, perhaps one of my

218
0:22:27,440 --> 0:22:34,640
favorite topics, daily testing or contacts of individual with SARS-CoV-2 infection and attendance

219
0:22:34,640 --> 0:22:41,360
and SARS-CoV-2 transmission in English, secondary schools and colleges, an open label, cluster,

220
0:22:41,360 --> 0:22:47,600
randomized trial. And I think we may have discussed this in pre-perform, but here it is, peer-reviewed.

221
0:22:48,400 --> 0:22:54,880
And this is a paper looking at test to stay versus the quarantine approach, right? So you have an

222
0:22:54,880 --> 0:23:00,880
individual who's had an exposure, you say, oh, you got to stay home for 10 or 14 days, or you say,

223
0:23:00,880 --> 0:23:05,840
you know what, you can keep coming to school. We're just going to test you every day. How well does

224
0:23:05,840 --> 0:23:12,720
the test to stay work in this study? So this involved 201 schools in England. They randomly

225
0:23:12,720 --> 0:23:20,960
assigned 201 schools, and there were 99 in the control group. There were 102 in the intervention

226
0:23:20,960 --> 0:23:28,960
group. This was a 10-week study from April 19th to May 10th of 2021. And then it continued into a

227
0:23:28,960 --> 0:23:36,000
pre-appointed stop date, June 27th, 2021, right? Get your 10 weeks. At the end of the day, not

228
0:23:36,000 --> 0:23:43,360
everyone participated, but 76 control group schools and 86 intervention group schools actively participated.

229
0:23:44,720 --> 0:23:54,400
There were 59.1 per 100,000 symptomatic PCR confirmed cases in control, 61.8 per 100,000 per week in

230
0:23:54,400 --> 0:23:59,840
the intervention group. So not a significant difference. So again, demonstrating the ability

231
0:23:59,840 --> 0:24:07,520
of these rapid lateral flow tests to actually perform very well in a test to stay school program.

232
0:24:07,520 --> 0:24:11,280
Because I think this is going to be a big issue in the future, right? You know, everyone is worried,

233
0:24:11,280 --> 0:24:15,200
if we do all these tests, we're going to have all these kids missing school when they don't need

234
0:24:15,200 --> 0:24:21,680
to. This is a way to say we can test, and then we can actually continue to test, and we can

235
0:24:21,680 --> 0:24:28,240
get people staying in school, continuing to have those educational opportunities in a safe environment.

236
0:24:29,280 --> 0:24:36,160
All right. Active vaccination. We're still in that pre-exposure period. Never miss an

237
0:24:36,160 --> 0:24:40,400
opportunity to vaccinate. Vaccination is how this pandemic ends. And I added a new one. And

238
0:24:40,400 --> 0:24:44,880
this is sort of, I feel like I'm channeling you, Vincent, vaccines, the jabs that keep you from

239
0:24:44,880 --> 0:24:53,920
getting sick. And I wanted to talk a little bit about vaccine conversations, right? So back to Eli

240
0:24:53,920 --> 0:24:59,200
Wiesel. You know, one of the things that he told me, you know, when I was there at Carnegie Hall,

241
0:24:59,200 --> 0:25:04,480
I'll, you know, full of myself because I just got my MD degree. And he said, you know what,

242
0:25:04,480 --> 0:25:09,120
I know you guys, you think you know it all, but the first thing I want to impress upon you,

243
0:25:09,760 --> 0:25:14,160
listen to your patients. And I think that's the big thing. When we have someone who comes in and

244
0:25:14,160 --> 0:25:18,800
sees us and they have been vaccinated, that's not the time to scold. That's not the time to tell

245
0:25:18,800 --> 0:25:23,680
them how smart you are and how much you know, that's the time to listen, right? And I think this is

246
0:25:23,680 --> 0:25:28,880
going to be more important because as we look in the coming weeks, vaccines potentially moving

247
0:25:28,880 --> 0:25:34,480
into younger ages, the antibactors are going to be on their home turf here, right? They've got all

248
0:25:34,480 --> 0:25:41,040
their arguments ready to go and they just need to pop, you know, something new in. So listen,

249
0:25:41,040 --> 0:25:46,960
find out what the concerns are. Let's let's really focus on people who have questions. There's a

250
0:25:46,960 --> 0:25:52,480
certain crowd, you know, and I think sort of going back to Eli Weisels, which maybe we just

251
0:25:52,480 --> 0:25:57,040
don't need to engage. We need to spend our time and resources on those people that are interested

252
0:25:57,040 --> 0:26:02,960
that have questions that are not really there just to anyway. Okay, so now a little bit about

253
0:26:02,960 --> 0:26:08,560
hybrid immunity. I like this preprint. So this is a preprint, high genetic barrier to escape

254
0:26:08,560 --> 0:26:16,240
from human polyclonal SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies posted as a preprint. And here the

255
0:26:16,240 --> 0:26:24,000
researchers used an HIV-1 pseudotyped variant system with a synthetic poly mutant spike that

256
0:26:24,000 --> 0:26:30,080
they generated by aggregating variant of concern associated and plasma selected spike mutations

257
0:26:30,080 --> 0:26:36,720
into a single poly mutant spike protein. Quite a mouthful, right? And actually I have to say this

258
0:26:36,720 --> 0:26:42,000
was sort of similar to the work that I was doing actually just not too far from Vincent's office

259
0:26:42,000 --> 0:26:47,920
before the pandemic started. But using this system, they were able to show that 20 naturally

260
0:26:47,920 --> 0:26:54,480
occurring mutations in SARS-CoV-2 spike were sufficient to confer near complete resistance to

261
0:26:54,480 --> 0:27:01,360
the polyclonal neutralizing antibodies generated by convalescence and mRNA vaccine recipients, right?

262
0:27:01,360 --> 0:27:07,680
So you put these 20 mutations in the spike and if you had an infection in the past where you had

263
0:27:07,680 --> 0:27:15,680
a couple doses of the MNR vaccine, your plasma actually was not able to neutralize this. However,

264
0:27:16,640 --> 0:27:22,720
and in this discovery, plasma from individuals who'd been infected and then got the mRNA vaccine,

265
0:27:23,600 --> 0:27:29,920
they were able to neutralize not only SARS-CoV-2 but also diverse other viruses in the same

266
0:27:29,920 --> 0:27:34,960
coronavirus family. So let's just translate this a little because I think this could be

267
0:27:34,960 --> 0:27:40,960
quite something. This is first of all, it's about neutralizing antibodies and changes in the spike

268
0:27:40,960 --> 0:27:45,680
protein, right? So it's not the whole complete picture looking at T cells, which we think are

269
0:27:45,680 --> 0:27:52,480
less sensitive to changes in spike. The researchers went ahead and they defined these 20 changes in

270
0:27:52,480 --> 0:27:58,160
the spike protein, ending up this near complete resistance to these neutralizing antibodies.

271
0:27:58,160 --> 0:28:04,480
And either people had COVID infection or people that got the Pfizer or the Moderna vaccines,

272
0:28:04,480 --> 0:28:10,320
the co-mariniti or the spike vaccine. They say mutations, but we're really dealing with amino

273
0:28:10,320 --> 0:28:15,440
acid changes, so the mutations in the genetic code that led to amino acids which changed the

274
0:28:15,440 --> 0:28:22,880
spike protein. Now they did show this, I think, rather interesting COVID first than two doses of

275
0:28:22,880 --> 0:28:28,880
mRNA vaccines. But there were really, I thought, I'm going to say four interesting questions and

276
0:28:28,880 --> 0:28:34,400
I'm hoping the reviewers asked them to address these prior to full publication. What about people

277
0:28:34,400 --> 0:28:41,600
who were vaccinated and then got an infection? Like I described my colleague, what does the

278
0:28:42,480 --> 0:28:47,280
antibodies from that individual look like? The next, and I think this is sort of time sensitive,

279
0:28:47,280 --> 0:28:51,440
what about an individual that gets that booster, right? We're talking about boosters and certain

280
0:28:51,440 --> 0:28:57,360
individuals getting those. What about someone who got a booster and then got infected? I think

281
0:28:57,360 --> 0:29:02,960
that's an interesting is that we're sort of weighing now if we give boosters versus exposure. Are we

282
0:29:02,960 --> 0:29:09,600
risking trouble with boosters? Original antigenic sin or the butterfly effect? So I'm going to leave

283
0:29:09,600 --> 0:29:14,640
that for a deeper dive with maybe our immune colleagues. And then, of course, what about those

284
0:29:14,640 --> 0:29:22,240
folks that got the J&J vaccine? So the red-headed stepchildren, they feel left out. What about people

285
0:29:22,240 --> 0:29:29,200
that got the J&J? How are they doing? And of course, boosters. We can't not mention boosters,

286
0:29:29,200 --> 0:29:33,520
but that's all I'm going to do here is just mention boosters. There was a very well-written

287
0:29:33,520 --> 0:29:39,200
and referenced viewpoint piece in the Lancet, considerations in boosting COVID-19 vaccine

288
0:29:39,200 --> 0:29:44,640
immune responses. And what I'm going to do here is I'm going to suggest that people not only take

289
0:29:44,640 --> 0:29:50,800
the time to read this brief three-page piece, but also go ahead and listen to TWIV 805.

290
0:29:51,520 --> 0:29:56,720
I really, Vincent, you guys did a great job of walking through kind of the questions, the issues

291
0:29:56,720 --> 0:30:03,920
there. The FDA will have actually met prior to this dropping on Saturday. But really, I thought

292
0:30:03,920 --> 0:30:09,840
this piece outlined a lot of the questions. I mean, the FDA wants their decisions, their

293
0:30:09,840 --> 0:30:14,880
recommendations to be driven by the science. And I think a lot of those questions about boosters,

294
0:30:16,240 --> 0:30:19,440
one is, is there really waning immunity that we're concerned about?

295
0:30:20,000 --> 0:30:27,440
Two, if you give people a booster, is there a benefit? What is the safety profile? Who has the

296
0:30:27,440 --> 0:30:34,400
best risk benefit should boosters be given out there? We're doing it now to individuals who have

297
0:30:34,400 --> 0:30:39,600
immune suppression. So, you know, organ transplant recipients, people with that sort of level of

298
0:30:39,600 --> 0:30:46,720
immune suppression. We know the antibodies go up. We need to know, is it more than that? Is this

299
0:30:46,720 --> 0:30:52,880
really effective? And we can talk about that. Passive vaccination, right? Just to close out our

300
0:30:52,880 --> 0:31:00,400
pre-exposure period of time, remember, monoclonals after high-risk exposures in high-risk people.

301
0:31:01,440 --> 0:31:08,080
But now we move to the period of viral replication. It's gotten through, and now the individual is

302
0:31:08,080 --> 0:31:15,120
actually infected. And during the viral symptom phase, I say the time for monitoring and monoclonals,

303
0:31:15,120 --> 0:31:20,240
not the time for antibiotics, and not the time for steroids. And I'm going to hit a little bit

304
0:31:20,240 --> 0:31:24,160
on steroids after I just sort of bring people up to date on what's going on with monoclonals.

305
0:31:25,440 --> 0:31:30,160
People have finally fully embraced monoclonals. And now, for the first time, there's concerns

306
0:31:30,160 --> 0:31:37,840
about shortages, right? We're shipping out 150,000 doses a week. I think we're US governments

307
0:31:37,840 --> 0:31:43,040
paying about $1,000 a dose. So, I think we're spending about $150 million a week on monoclonals.

308
0:31:43,040 --> 0:31:48,720
That's a lot of money. And we got an announcement from the US Department of Health and Human Services.

309
0:31:48,720 --> 0:31:54,240
Let me read this and put it in context. The recent increase in the prevalence of the Delta variant

310
0:31:54,240 --> 0:32:00,400
of COVID-19 has caused a substantial surge in the utilization of monoclonal antibody drugs.

311
0:32:00,400 --> 0:32:04,400
It remains the goal of the federal government to ensure continued availability of these drugs

312
0:32:04,400 --> 0:32:10,800
for current and future patients. As such, HHS is immediately implementing the following changes

313
0:32:10,800 --> 0:32:16,320
to help promote optimal and equitable use of the available supply of monoclonal antibodies

314
0:32:16,320 --> 0:32:21,680
while we continue efforts to procure additional products, limiting immediate orders and shipments

315
0:32:21,680 --> 0:32:27,600
only to administration sites with HHS protect accounts and current utilization reporting

316
0:32:27,600 --> 0:32:33,120
and reviewing all orders for alignment with utilization. So, what is this? Basically,

317
0:32:33,120 --> 0:32:39,680
the federal government is jumping in saying we need to make sure that these products are used

318
0:32:39,680 --> 0:32:44,640
appropriately. We're going to be sending them to sites that are giving us the data so that we

319
0:32:44,640 --> 0:32:54,160
know what's going on. What is the HHS protect? This is really an ecosystem. This is a secure platform

320
0:32:54,160 --> 0:33:01,840
for authentication, amalgamation, and sharing of healthcare information. Really looking for

321
0:33:01,840 --> 0:33:07,520
the ability to keep an eye and make sure that these drugs, which are now becoming

322
0:33:08,160 --> 0:33:12,720
in limited supply as opposed to sitting on shelves, are really going to the people that need them.

323
0:33:12,720 --> 0:33:18,080
This is sort of prompt that I think fear, fear about shortages that I hope are exaggerated.

324
0:33:18,800 --> 0:33:22,480
There was sort of this idea for a while that you don't need to get vaccinated because you can

325
0:33:22,480 --> 0:33:26,000
always get your monoclonals and now people are a little worried. Maybe I should get my vaccine

326
0:33:26,000 --> 0:33:32,080
because maybe I can't just get that monoclonal. But the current U.S. administration reported that

327
0:33:32,080 --> 0:33:38,400
they will buy more than 1.7 million more doses of the monoclonal antibodies. They're going to get

328
0:33:38,400 --> 0:33:45,440
the bulk 1.4 million from Regeneron. Another 388,000 are coming from Eli Lilly, and perhaps

329
0:33:45,440 --> 0:33:51,440
we'll hear about even more being purchased from V or GSK. There's even a couple other

330
0:33:51,440 --> 0:33:59,600
companies out there trying to move for e-way for their products as well. Just to keep this on

331
0:33:59,600 --> 0:34:03,520
people's radar, I've been bringing this up for a while. I'm waiting for the data to share.

332
0:34:03,520 --> 0:34:10,960
But we are expecting October and November, December applications for e-way of effective

333
0:34:10,960 --> 0:34:15,920
oral antivirals. We've got multiple companies working on several products. So some optimism

334
0:34:15,920 --> 0:34:21,440
there that we're going to have another option. But I want to go back to steroids. This is the

335
0:34:21,440 --> 0:34:25,920
individual shows up at a primary care office. Maybe they show up at an urgent care. They're in that

336
0:34:25,920 --> 0:34:31,520
first week. They're in their viral symptom phase. We know some folks. Maybe they're not listening

337
0:34:31,520 --> 0:34:36,880
to Twiv. They're trying to do the right thing. They throw some steroids, some vitamins, some

338
0:34:36,880 --> 0:34:44,480
antibiotics at the patient. Well, is that harmless? Is that okay? Well, this was a really nice meta

339
0:34:44,480 --> 0:34:51,280
analysis, a systemic review, steroid use in non-oxygen requiring steroids use in non-oxygen

340
0:34:51,280 --> 0:34:57,920
requiring COVID-19 patients a systematic review and meta analysis. So they initially identified

341
0:34:57,920 --> 0:35:07,040
6,411 studies. They then screened 2,990 after an initial exclusion. And then they finally narrowed

342
0:35:07,040 --> 0:35:15,840
it down to seven studies, which fit the criteria. So we're ultimately looking at 2,214 non-oxygen

343
0:35:15,840 --> 0:35:22,640
requiring COVID-19 patients. And I think this is really critical. Overall, odds of progression to

344
0:35:22,640 --> 0:35:31,520
severe disease among the non-oxygen requiring COVID-19 patients receiving steroids was 5.97.

345
0:35:32,080 --> 0:35:38,160
So basically by trying to be helpful by giving steroids in that first week, you were increasing

346
0:35:38,160 --> 0:35:45,040
a patient's odds of progressing to severe disease, 6, almost 6-fold. And you increase their odds of

347
0:35:45,040 --> 0:35:53,440
death 1.35. So a 35% increase in their chance of death as compared to patients not receiving steroids.

348
0:35:53,440 --> 0:36:00,080
You also increase the mean duration of fever. You increase the mean duration till viral clearance.

349
0:36:00,080 --> 0:36:05,280
And if they did end up in the hospital, you increased their length of hospital stay with the median

350
0:36:05,280 --> 0:36:13,520
of 20.8 days. You know, I've got to say this is just sort of reinforcing. During that first week,

351
0:36:13,520 --> 0:36:19,440
we don't have a lot. We can offer the monoclonals to a certain subset, but we certainly can harm

352
0:36:19,440 --> 0:36:27,440
these individuals. They have a really nice figure, figure 4 in this paper, where you can actually

353
0:36:27,440 --> 0:36:33,040
compare folks that did or didn't get steroids. And you can see the harm that can be done here.

354
0:36:33,840 --> 0:36:38,960
So again, for the first week, this is the time for monitoring and monoclonals. It is not the time

355
0:36:38,960 --> 0:36:44,960
for antibiotics. It is not the time for steroids. We can do harm with steroids. We could significantly

356
0:36:44,960 --> 0:36:49,520
increase a person's chance of ending up in hospital. And we also know, as we talked about,

357
0:36:49,520 --> 0:36:55,600
with azithromycin, with doxycycline, other antibiotics, these are not helpful and potentially harmful.

358
0:36:55,600 --> 0:37:00,320
I think we talked about the one doxycycline study, where there was a 5-fold increase in death,

359
0:37:00,320 --> 0:37:06,720
just given those those antibiotics. So remember, we can harm people during this first week. But then,

360
0:37:06,720 --> 0:37:11,760
once they progress to that second week, this is when people often get hospitalized,

361
0:37:11,760 --> 0:37:16,960
we have really good evidence for benefit of steroids, if they have an oxygen saturation

362
0:37:16,960 --> 0:37:25,360
less than 94%. So that matters and timing really matters with COVID. And we also had a nice review

363
0:37:25,360 --> 0:37:32,000
of steroids in the hospital setting. And so this was review in adults with severe critical COVID-19,

364
0:37:32,000 --> 0:37:38,240
corticosteroids reduce mortality versus standard care and analysis with or without the recovery

365
0:37:38,240 --> 0:37:44,480
trial. So this is seven randomized control trials, one cohort study published in international

366
0:37:44,480 --> 0:37:49,440
immunopharmacology. And I really like this because I think we've talked a little bit about meta

367
0:37:49,440 --> 0:37:54,880
analyses. But you have to be careful that your meta analysis is not being swayed too heavily by

368
0:37:54,880 --> 0:37:59,360
just one study, right? Otherwise, it's really not a meta analysis, it's that one study pushing

369
0:37:59,360 --> 0:38:05,600
things. And the recovery trial done by the folks in the UK was a large trial. So you want to pull

370
0:38:05,600 --> 0:38:13,040
that out and say without that, how do we do? So a total of 6771 patients from these eight

371
0:38:13,040 --> 0:38:18,400
prospective studies, seven randomized control, one prospective cohort were included in this meta

372
0:38:18,400 --> 0:38:24,480
analysis. And the results showed that corticosteroid therapy at the right time in the right patients

373
0:38:24,480 --> 0:38:32,000
was associated with lower mortality in severe COVID-19. So an odds ratio of 0.70. So a 30%

374
0:38:32,000 --> 0:38:38,480
reduction in mortality. Since the proportion of recovery trial was so large, they remove that.

375
0:38:38,480 --> 0:38:45,840
When you remove that, the odds ratio was 0.65. So a 35% reduction in mortality. So even without

376
0:38:45,840 --> 0:38:51,280
that study, we're still seeing this 30, 35%. So we're seeing a clear mortality benefit.

377
0:38:51,280 --> 0:38:57,360
So remember, this is when we're using steroids. It's when we're using remdesivir, pulmonary

378
0:38:57,360 --> 0:39:04,080
support, anticoagulation, and then only in select patients further immune modulations such as

379
0:39:04,080 --> 0:39:12,480
tosyllismab or barisitinip. Okay. The tail phase long COVID, sort of an exciting announcement,

380
0:39:12,480 --> 0:39:18,960
I will say this last week. As we've been saying, COVID is not just a two week viral illness for

381
0:39:18,960 --> 0:39:28,560
many people. On Wednesday, September 15th, the NIH announced NIH builds large nationwide study

382
0:39:28,560 --> 0:39:33,920
population of tens of thousands to support research on long term effects of COVID-19.

383
0:39:33,920 --> 0:39:40,960
So the NIH awarded nearly $470 million to New York University, NYU, Langone Health,

384
0:39:41,760 --> 0:39:47,440
New York City, which will make multiple subawards to more than 100 researchers at more than 30

385
0:39:47,440 --> 0:39:53,360
institutions and will serve as the recovery clinical science core. So this combined population

386
0:39:53,360 --> 0:39:58,560
of research participants from new and existing cohorts called the medical court will comprise

387
0:39:58,560 --> 0:40:03,760
this recovery cohort. And this funding is being supported by the American Rescue Plan.

388
0:40:03,760 --> 0:40:09,040
So this is really an attempt. We've seen over the last 18, 20 months, a little longer now.

389
0:40:09,920 --> 0:40:15,040
A lot of money was spent. A lot of trials were set up. We don't have the data we would like.

390
0:40:15,040 --> 0:40:20,560
This is really an attempt to say long COVID, it's important, post-acute squelly of COVID.

391
0:40:20,560 --> 0:40:25,680
This is important. We need to do this right. We need to establish a cohort. We need to make

392
0:40:25,680 --> 0:40:31,680
sure this is studied properly. We need to be organized when we do this. So yeah, it's taken a

393
0:40:31,680 --> 0:40:36,800
little longer than a lot of us would hope to get this set up. But I'm really optimistic that we

394
0:40:36,800 --> 0:40:42,720
are now going to do this correctly. And I will mention NYU, that's my medical school alma mater.

395
0:40:42,720 --> 0:40:50,640
So I'm sure they will do a great job. All right. Now, what about the rest of the world? No one is

396
0:40:50,640 --> 0:40:56,480
safe until everyone is safe. So is there really a false dichotomy regarding vaccinating the world?

397
0:40:56,480 --> 0:41:02,080
Perhaps the most selfish thing we can do is now vaccinate the world. And there's I think an upcoming

398
0:41:03,360 --> 0:41:07,920
Twib is going to be looking at sort of analysis. What is the best way to use our vaccines?

399
0:41:07,920 --> 0:41:16,480
But one of the concerns that has been coming up is are we allowing these variants to evolve to

400
0:41:16,480 --> 0:41:21,840
develop in these areas? So there was a research article, a year of genomic surveillance reveals

401
0:41:21,840 --> 0:41:27,360
how the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic unfolds in Africa as published in science. And in this article,

402
0:41:27,360 --> 0:41:36,640
the authors describe the genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 using a data set of 8,746 genomes

403
0:41:36,640 --> 0:41:43,760
from 33 African countries and two overseas territories. Really interesting. And I think

404
0:41:43,760 --> 0:41:48,960
what I'm going to do is I'm going to tell people keep listening to Twib upcoming episodes where we

405
0:41:48,960 --> 0:41:55,440
get a deeper dive into the variants and what's going on and what is the calculus with vaccines.

406
0:41:56,480 --> 0:42:00,960
Coming up, we have the UN. I guess they're meeting on Tuesday. And there's going to be a whole

407
0:42:00,960 --> 0:42:05,760
discussion about how we successfully vaccinate the world. Hopefully, a lot of creative ideas about

408
0:42:05,760 --> 0:42:10,000
how we get this done. But on that note, I'm going to say throughout the months of August,

409
0:42:10,000 --> 0:42:16,480
September and October, go to parasiteswithoutboarders.com, donate. Donations made to parasites without

410
0:42:16,480 --> 0:42:25,040
borders will be doubled up to $40,000 in total support for floating doctors, help them continue to do

411
0:42:25,040 --> 0:42:30,560
the great work they're doing down there in Panama. Time for some email questions. For Daniel,

412
0:42:30,560 --> 0:42:39,280
you can send yours to Daniel at microbe.tv. Alison is very concerned about children. She's been

413
0:42:39,280 --> 0:42:45,040
thinking for a few weeks that the next 12 weeks are going to be full of thousands of children dying

414
0:42:45,840 --> 0:42:49,920
under 12 years of age. She wants to know, are any of the monoclonal treatments approved or in

415
0:42:49,920 --> 0:42:59,200
trials for people that young? That is a challenge, right? The same population under 12, that is not

416
0:42:59,200 --> 0:43:05,200
eligible for vaccination is not eligible for the monoclonals as well. I think if we look at the

417
0:43:05,200 --> 0:43:09,520
numbers, we're not talking about thousands of children dying. And a couple things I'm going to

418
0:43:09,520 --> 0:43:14,480
say here, you know, I've always talked about like, you know, we need to care about children. When we

419
0:43:14,480 --> 0:43:19,520
talk about a pandemic of the unvaccinated, we are talking more and more about children when we say

420
0:43:19,520 --> 0:43:24,640
that. Schools are opening and people are worried. But I think I've tried to point out several times

421
0:43:24,640 --> 0:43:30,960
and share some of the science on this is that we can safely have children in these environments.

422
0:43:30,960 --> 0:43:36,080
It involves several layers of protection. It actually can sometimes even be safer than keeping

423
0:43:36,080 --> 0:43:42,080
them out of the schools. It involves masking, testing, vaccinating all the people around them

424
0:43:42,080 --> 0:43:48,080
that can be vaccinated, testing. So there's a lot of ways to do this. We certainly can do it poorly.

425
0:43:48,640 --> 0:43:52,640
But no, I think we can do this safely. And I think we're waking up. We're sort of being

426
0:43:52,640 --> 0:43:57,200
reminded, Oh my gosh, this is still, we are still in the middle of a pandemic. And I think we're

427
0:43:57,200 --> 0:44:04,320
starting to see the numbers go down. So I am optimistic here going forward. And I think I've been sort

428
0:44:04,320 --> 0:44:10,400
of suggesting that maybe by Halloween, there'll be vaccines for the younger kids. But then again,

429
0:44:10,400 --> 0:44:14,880
you know, the FDA is getting a lot of pressure and what we really want is an FDA we can trust,

430
0:44:14,880 --> 0:44:20,640
an FDA that follows the science. So when we do move to less than 12, we want to know what's the

431
0:44:20,640 --> 0:44:26,880
safe dose? What are the things we should be watching out for? How do we make this as safe and effective

432
0:44:26,880 --> 0:44:30,880
as possible? And it is really hard, I know, during a pandemic to wait.

433
0:44:32,880 --> 0:44:39,600
So Jeff is at Koga University and asks about what to do with students who test positive. So

434
0:44:39,600 --> 0:44:43,840
they have a 96% vaccination rate. But when students test positive, they have to be

435
0:44:43,840 --> 0:44:49,120
quarantined. And he writes, given the data that shows a rapid decrease in viral RNA, as well as in

436
0:44:49,120 --> 0:44:53,360
the ability to detect infectious virus and vaccinated individuals following infection,

437
0:44:53,360 --> 0:44:58,400
it would seem reasonable to decrease the length of isolation time for vaccinated individuals,

438
0:44:58,960 --> 0:45:04,240
as they would unlikely be able to transmit virus past, say, six days post positive instead of

439
0:45:04,240 --> 0:45:08,720
10 days. Of course, we're going to continue to follow the New York state guidelines. But wonder

440
0:45:08,720 --> 0:45:13,520
if it would be reasonable to lobby these agencies for reduced isolation time for vaccinated

441
0:45:13,520 --> 0:45:18,960
individuals. Would love to hear your thoughts on this issue. Yeah, you know, actually, I've got to

442
0:45:18,960 --> 0:45:25,120
say you bring up an interesting concept, the idea of lobbying organizations. I always think what

443
0:45:25,120 --> 0:45:29,680
my natural responses is we need the science. The organizations can respond when we have the

444
0:45:29,680 --> 0:45:34,800
science. And what we really need is not lobbying, but funding so that these investigations can be

445
0:45:34,800 --> 0:45:39,200
done. Because right, we have a growing body of evidence that, you know, there's a certain window

446
0:45:39,200 --> 0:45:44,720
of time when a person is infectious, right, that two days before that three to five days afterwards.

447
0:45:45,360 --> 0:45:50,720
With an individual who's vaccinated, do they really need isolation of the infected for 10 days?

448
0:45:50,720 --> 0:45:55,600
Maybe not. But I think what we need is we need the science, and then you bring the science,

449
0:45:55,600 --> 0:46:00,880
and then the science helps us move forward. And the other, I hope, is the concept of the test

450
0:46:00,880 --> 0:46:06,640
to stay. So when an individual test positive, maybe that isolation is shorter. But maybe the

451
0:46:06,640 --> 0:46:11,920
exposures don't need to necessarily stay home quarantining. Maybe they can test to stay.

452
0:46:12,560 --> 0:46:15,760
And that's something where we're seeing a growing body of evidence to suggest that

453
0:46:15,760 --> 0:46:21,680
could be safely implemented. Ingrid wants to know should individuals who are vaccinated and test

454
0:46:21,680 --> 0:46:28,160
positive for COVID take monoclonal antibodies? So, you know, we say we don't we don't look at

455
0:46:28,160 --> 0:46:31,920
vaccination status when making decisions about monoclonals. But to be honest, right,

456
0:46:31,920 --> 0:46:36,480
did we study the monoclonal specifically in people who are vaccinated? We use the same

457
0:46:36,480 --> 0:46:41,200
criteria. If you are considered at a high risk of progressing, whether or not you are vaccinated,

458
0:46:41,200 --> 0:46:46,640
if you are symptomatic, then we'd recommend monoclonals. If you're completely asymptomatic,

459
0:46:46,640 --> 0:46:51,920
and that's sort of a point here, completely asymptomatic individuals vaccinated, unvaccinated,

460
0:46:51,920 --> 0:46:56,960
you need to at least have some symptomatology, and then one high risk or other feature for going

461
0:46:56,960 --> 0:46:59,840
ahead with monoclonals. But vaccination is in no way an exclusion.

462
0:46:59,840 --> 0:47:09,200
And finally, Dan is a pediatric pulmonologist who retired in 2016 after 36 years in pediatric

463
0:47:09,200 --> 0:47:14,000
medicine. I've been an advocate of asthma education in the school and at home since.

464
0:47:14,000 --> 0:47:17,760
I've been following your updates at Twiv for several months. Appreciate your review of the

465
0:47:17,760 --> 0:47:23,120
literature. Since the pandemic began, I've been following local data in San Antonio.

466
0:47:23,120 --> 0:47:29,040
As a private citizen, I have been confused and do not understand why pediatric data are not reported,

467
0:47:29,040 --> 0:47:38,160
similar to adult data. And Dan goes on to write about his experience with pediatric critical care

468
0:47:38,160 --> 0:47:44,720
early in his career and how having such data would be important. So he writes,

469
0:47:46,240 --> 0:47:51,440
the low numbers do not reflect the tragedy at the local level as an asthma or flu. I question

470
0:47:51,440 --> 0:47:55,600
any death in a child as preventable. I've only filed intermittently. If you've discussed this

471
0:47:55,600 --> 0:47:59,040
issue before, let me know. But I'd like to know your thoughts on this.

472
0:47:59,680 --> 0:48:06,560
No, I mean, I think this is great. And I think I've always tried for a while to start off the

473
0:48:06,560 --> 0:48:11,680
updates with children and COVID and try to steer people towards where those resources are. So

474
0:48:11,680 --> 0:48:17,920
the American Academy of Pediatrics, the CDC has a special site looking at this. It is interesting

475
0:48:17,920 --> 0:48:22,960
that you can't just toggle and get this information more readily, like the Hopkins or the World

476
0:48:22,960 --> 0:48:28,560
Ometer dashboard, just click. I want to specifically look at the age group that I'm focused on here.

477
0:48:28,560 --> 0:48:33,680
So yeah, I agree. And I think that it's, as I mentioned, from the beginning, it's sort of in

478
0:48:33,680 --> 0:48:39,360
this odd, touchy subject. And there's also been a lot of, I think, false ideas where people say,

479
0:48:39,360 --> 0:48:43,280
you know what? Let me look at the data year ago when the kids were locked in basements and they

480
0:48:43,280 --> 0:48:47,440
were not getting exposed to COVID and boy, there were no hospitalizations. So I think we can safely

481
0:48:47,440 --> 0:48:52,160
just open the schools without masks and let them all get infected. They'll be fine. Now that they're

482
0:48:52,160 --> 0:48:56,000
opening the schools and getting infected, we're seeing the kids are not all right. We're seeing

483
0:48:56,000 --> 0:49:00,640
thousands of hospitalizations per week. We're seeing a couple deaths every day on average.

484
0:49:01,360 --> 0:49:06,960
That is in no way. Okay. So yeah, I share that we need to need to have this data front and center.

485
0:49:06,960 --> 0:49:11,120
I mean, right now the conversation is all about boosters. Yeah, that's fine. And all

486
0:49:11,120 --> 0:49:15,440
let's talk about the people that haven't even had a first shot and who are at risk and getting

487
0:49:15,440 --> 0:49:20,160
infected. In the interest of time, I've been abbreviating some of these letters, but I encourage

488
0:49:20,160 --> 0:49:26,800
listeners to go to microbe.tv slash to have you can find all the text of all of them online there.

489
0:49:26,800 --> 0:49:34,160
They're very useful to read. That's COVID-19 clinical update number 80 with Dr. Daniel Griffin.

490
0:49:34,160 --> 0:49:52,160
Thank you, Daniel. Oh, thank you. Vincent, you and everyone else be safe.
