0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:06,880
This week in virology, the podcast about viruses, the kind that make you sick.

2
0:00:10,240 --> 0:00:20,720
From Microbe TV, this is Twiv, this week in virology, Episode 772, recorded on June 24, 2021.

3
0:00:20,720 --> 0:00:25,920
I'm Vincent Rackeniello, and you're listening to the podcast all about viruses.

4
0:00:25,920 --> 0:00:29,120
Joining me today from New York, Daniel Griffin.

5
0:00:29,120 --> 0:00:38,720
Hello, everyone. This is number 68, Daniel. And, you know, over a year of updates, it seems to me

6
0:00:38,720 --> 0:00:44,960
that at least here in the US, things are getting better. You know, they certainly are, particularly

7
0:00:44,960 --> 0:00:51,440
in many parts of the US. We still have our regional pockets, a little shout out to Missouri, right,

8
0:00:51,440 --> 0:01:00,000
where the positivity rate is over 6%. So, but areas, I'll say, I was on a call earlier this week where

9
0:01:00,000 --> 0:01:04,640
we were talking about can we start doing nebulizers, things like that, you know, with a little bit

10
0:01:04,640 --> 0:01:11,040
more flexibility. So, nebulizers, if people are not familiar, is where maybe an individual comes in,

11
0:01:11,040 --> 0:01:17,040
they're having trouble breathing. And we actually use a device called a nebulizer, which creates

12
0:01:17,040 --> 0:01:24,640
small particles, right, that can be inhaled that have maybe bronco dilators, medicines that will

13
0:01:24,640 --> 0:01:28,880
open up the airways, help them breathe better. Maybe they're having an asthma attack or a

14
0:01:29,680 --> 0:01:35,040
COPD exacerbation. And we've been hesitant to use those, but we actually were saying, boy,

15
0:01:35,040 --> 0:01:40,560
if a person's vaccinated, if your prevalence is, you know, your test positivity rate is under 1%,

16
0:01:41,680 --> 0:01:45,680
you could start thinking about being a little bit more flexible. I mean, we've always done that

17
0:01:45,680 --> 0:01:50,080
when it's been really severe at an emergency. And one of the people on the call said, that's

18
0:01:50,080 --> 0:01:56,240
pretty strict under 1%, and I was proud to say here in New York, our test positivity rate is under

19
0:01:56,240 --> 0:02:01,520
1%, and we are doing a lot of testing. But that's not true everywhere as we sort of bring up.

20
0:02:02,720 --> 0:02:07,280
All right, so let's start with our quotation, and then let's get right into the thick of it. So,

21
0:02:07,840 --> 0:02:14,080
the quotation, prejudice is a burden that confuses the past, threatens the future,

22
0:02:14,080 --> 0:02:21,280
and renders the present inaccessible. And that's by Maya Angelou. And I like that because I think

23
0:02:21,280 --> 0:02:27,440
that I feel like we all need to keep being reminded that we don't want, we don't want confirmation

24
0:02:27,440 --> 0:02:32,560
bias. We don't want to go into something thinking we know what the truth is. We want to have our

25
0:02:32,560 --> 0:02:37,680
eyes open so that we can actually continue to learn and move forward. Not everything that we

26
0:02:37,680 --> 0:02:42,240
thought we knew a year ago has turned out to be true. And not everything we thought a year ago

27
0:02:42,240 --> 0:02:48,720
that was untrue. That's turned out to be such. So, I think we still need to keep learning. We still

28
0:02:48,720 --> 0:02:53,520
have so much to learn, and we'll get into that as we go forward. But the update really hits home

29
0:02:53,520 --> 0:03:00,080
with Vincent, your first question, which was how are things going? And I'd say this is sort of a

30
0:03:00,080 --> 0:03:07,440
tough day, a tough week on several levels. I don't know if our listeners know, but one of my cows,

31
0:03:07,440 --> 0:03:14,080
my cow, I suppose, and my heifer actually died in Uganda. There was a viral disease. The

32
0:03:14,080 --> 0:03:19,280
hoof and mouth disease was sweeping through Eastern Uganda, which periodically happens. And so my

33
0:03:20,000 --> 0:03:28,000
cow died, which is tragic. I mean, tragic because you care about your animals, but also this was a

34
0:03:28,000 --> 0:03:34,000
cow that was providing seven liters of milk a day to help feed people. And it was even economically.

35
0:03:34,000 --> 0:03:39,840
This is part of the income that was helping to support Mary, my little heifer, who is only about

36
0:03:39,840 --> 0:03:46,640
a year old. So that's difficult, right? For those of us, we talk about how difficult the pandemic

37
0:03:46,640 --> 0:03:51,440
has been. We couldn't go to that bar. We couldn't see that movie. We were trapped in our houses. But

38
0:03:52,000 --> 0:03:57,520
just really to bring home people in Uganda, where the virus is surging again, and there's a vaccine

39
0:03:57,520 --> 0:04:04,880
shortage, this is about not having food. This is about going to bed hungry. Here, though, in the US,

40
0:04:04,880 --> 0:04:10,560
right? Today, I was covering three of the hospitals, and my other partner was covering the other

41
0:04:10,560 --> 0:04:17,040
three, just two of us covering these six hospitals, because one of my partners, Dr. Anujali, was off

42
0:04:17,040 --> 0:04:23,760
attending the funeral of her brother's wife. And this, I think, was tragic. Anujis, sister-in-law,

43
0:04:23,760 --> 0:04:29,360
was in her early 50s. She did not want to get vaccinated because she had learned through social

44
0:04:29,360 --> 0:04:36,320
media that there were microchips in the vaccines. She went ahead, she got infected. Little over a

45
0:04:36,320 --> 0:04:42,800
week later, she ended up in the hospital, intubated, died, leaving behind a husband and her teenage

46
0:04:42,800 --> 0:04:50,480
children. This is just tragic. I think when people make up stuff like these microchips and

47
0:04:50,480 --> 0:04:57,920
all these other crazy things, there's no science there. This is not a scientific debate. It's just

48
0:04:57,920 --> 0:05:04,000
untrue. And that has repercussions. And someone's got to explain to these teenage children that they

49
0:05:04,000 --> 0:05:11,760
no longer have a mom. So, as mentioned, we started our country as a patchwork with different ideas

50
0:05:11,760 --> 0:05:17,440
about and different vaccination rates. Areas with high vaccination rates tend to be the areas with

51
0:05:17,440 --> 0:05:23,520
low COVID. Areas with low vaccination rates tend to be the areas where we're seeing high COVID rates

52
0:05:23,520 --> 0:05:27,840
and hospitalizations and deaths. What we're also seeing, and I'm sort of putting this in right

53
0:05:27,840 --> 0:05:32,720
before the children, but we'll get into this, is that we're actually seeing all those common

54
0:05:32,720 --> 0:05:38,960
winter viruses packed into June. So, now that everyone's taking off their masks, everyone's

55
0:05:38,960 --> 0:05:44,880
celebrating, everyone's getting all the kids together and such, the CDC actually had to issue

56
0:05:44,880 --> 0:05:51,600
an alert regarding a rapid rise in RSV, respiratory syncytial virus, particularly in the south.

57
0:05:52,240 --> 0:06:00,800
But we're also seeing spikes in para-inchluenza, common coronavirus, particularly OC43.

58
0:06:01,920 --> 0:06:08,080
I actually had recently a question from actually a clinician, which sort of shocked me. And they

59
0:06:08,080 --> 0:06:12,880
were asking whether or not I thought the COVID vaccines were causing these people to develop

60
0:06:12,880 --> 0:06:18,320
upper respiratory infections. And there is, I have to say, no way that a COVID vaccination

61
0:06:18,320 --> 0:06:24,880
will give you para-influenza virus or RSV. So, no, this is behavioral. And I think a lot of

62
0:06:24,880 --> 0:06:30,640
times we like to try to blame something else. But no, these viruses are now spreading. We're seeing

63
0:06:30,640 --> 0:06:36,880
a lot of this. And in New York, we're not seeing much COVID-19, but we are seeing a lot of these

64
0:06:36,880 --> 0:06:44,080
ERIs. So, important for people to realize that. Children and COVID, children are at low risk,

65
0:06:44,080 --> 0:06:50,320
but they're not at no risk. So, never miss an opportunity to test. I'm going to jump right

66
0:06:50,320 --> 0:06:54,960
forward here. I don't think this will shock anyone, but it's going to tie right into the

67
0:06:54,960 --> 0:07:00,240
kids again. And this was the article assessing the association between social gatherings and

68
0:07:00,240 --> 0:07:07,440
COVID-19 risk using birthdays. And this was published in Java Internal Medicine. And this was a cross

69
0:07:07,440 --> 0:07:14,640
sectional study using administrative healthcare data on 2.9 million households from the first

70
0:07:14,640 --> 0:07:20,640
45 weeks of 2020. And they found that among households in the top decile of the country,

71
0:07:20,640 --> 0:07:26,480
as far as COVID-19 prevalence, those with birthdays had more diagnoses of COVID-19

72
0:07:26,480 --> 0:07:32,880
compared with households that it had not had a birthday in the two weeks after that birthday was

73
0:07:32,880 --> 0:07:39,280
held. Now, what I will say here is this really was significant in areas where there was a high

74
0:07:39,280 --> 0:07:44,880
incidence of COVID, right? If there's a high incidence of COVID and you have a birthday party,

75
0:07:44,880 --> 0:07:50,960
that's what's going to spread. If COVID incidence is low, they did not see this. And here, and I

76
0:07:50,960 --> 0:07:54,560
think this is a perfect example here in New York, when people are having birthdays and other

77
0:07:54,560 --> 0:08:00,480
celebrations, it's the common coronaviruses. It's RSV. It's the rhinoenteroviruses. It's the

78
0:08:00,480 --> 0:08:04,640
the other common colds that are spreading. And I think that this is critical, right? As people

79
0:08:04,640 --> 0:08:10,960
are making decisions, this really prevalence issue is important as you're making decisions

80
0:08:10,960 --> 0:08:15,920
about what to do. And the other thing that is coming up here, and I'm going to sort of a subtlety

81
0:08:15,920 --> 0:08:22,240
and nuance here, is that we're back in the times of low prevalence and poor positive

82
0:08:22,240 --> 0:08:28,720
predictive value in many parts of our country. So this, people maybe remember that word orthogonal

83
0:08:28,720 --> 0:08:36,240
for orthogonal testing. So if an individual comes in, maybe it's a screening, they're asymptomatic,

84
0:08:36,240 --> 0:08:42,640
they need a negative test for some reason, it comes back positive. If your prevalence is less

85
0:08:42,640 --> 0:08:48,640
than 1%, that's probably false positive. From a medical scientific point of view, you can repeat

86
0:08:48,640 --> 0:08:55,520
that to clarify the picture. But most jurisdictions, the Department of Health is still operating

87
0:08:55,520 --> 0:09:01,040
under the, and I hate these words, abundance of caution. You still need to treat that positive

88
0:09:01,040 --> 0:09:04,960
as a positive. So if that individual is going to be heading off the camp, they've got to wait

89
0:09:04,960 --> 0:09:11,920
those 10 days of isolation. So we'll see where that goes going forward. Active vaccination,

90
0:09:11,920 --> 0:09:17,360
never miss an opportunity to vaccinate. And as I still believe vaccines are how this pandemic ends,

91
0:09:17,360 --> 0:09:23,920
this comes up all the time. So I will touch on it. Maybe this is, I guess, more of interest to

92
0:09:23,920 --> 0:09:28,960
physicians, more of interest to people with immune suppression, but I think it's of interest to

93
0:09:28,960 --> 0:09:37,040
everyone. Another article was published, safety and immunogenicity of a third dose of SARS-CoV-2

94
0:09:37,040 --> 0:09:43,440
vaccine in solid organ transplant recipients, a case series published in the Annals of Internal

95
0:09:43,440 --> 0:09:49,040
Medicine. So a little background with which our regular listeners are probably familiar.

96
0:09:50,080 --> 0:09:57,360
The antibody response after two doses of an M RNA vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 is excellent

97
0:09:57,360 --> 0:10:03,280
in the general population, but can be markedly attenuated or even undetectable in transplant

98
0:10:03,280 --> 0:10:10,160
recipients. So here, the authors reported on 30 patients that received a third dose of vaccine

99
0:10:10,160 --> 0:10:19,920
in 22 patients. Maintenance immunosuppression included cachrolymus or cyclosporin plus mycofenolate.

100
0:10:20,960 --> 0:10:28,320
In addition, corticosteroids were used for 24 patients, ceralymus for one, bilatosept for one,

101
0:10:28,880 --> 0:10:36,320
the median time between transplantation and initial vaccination was 4.5 years. So what did they find?

102
0:10:36,320 --> 0:10:42,800
Well, before they received their third dose of vaccine, 24 of the 30 patients had negative

103
0:10:42,800 --> 0:10:49,280
antibody titers and six had low positive antibody titers. So remember, this is a case series that

104
0:10:49,280 --> 0:10:56,400
we're looking at. The patients received the third dose of vaccine a median of 67 days

105
0:10:57,200 --> 0:11:05,200
after the second dose of that initial vaccine series. So 15 patients received the J&J, the Johnson

106
0:11:05,200 --> 0:11:12,960
and Johnson Janssen, nine received Moderna, six received Pfizer, BioNTech. And what did they find?

107
0:11:13,760 --> 0:11:19,120
Repeated antibody testing a median of 14 days after the third dose, in this case,

108
0:11:19,120 --> 0:11:25,360
a vaccine revealed that of the six patients with low positive antibody titers before the third dose

109
0:11:25,360 --> 0:11:32,160
all had high positive antibody titers after the third dose. In contrast, the 24 patients

110
0:11:32,160 --> 0:11:39,200
with negative antibody titers before the third dose, 25% went on to have high positive titers.

111
0:11:40,080 --> 0:11:46,960
8% had low positive titers, and the remainder, so 67% just remained negative.

112
0:11:46,960 --> 0:11:52,080
This is interesting, and I agree with the author's comments. There were certain limitations here.

113
0:11:52,080 --> 0:11:58,640
I mean, limitations of the study, obvious right off, was this was a small and heterogeneous

114
0:11:58,640 --> 0:12:05,120
convenient sample, and there were no assays for neutralizing antibody, no specific B cell memory,

115
0:12:05,120 --> 0:12:11,520
or T cell response assays. This is interesting. We still need additional trials to determine

116
0:12:11,520 --> 0:12:16,000
whether booster doses to prevent COVID-19 in transphine patients is warranted.

117
0:12:16,000 --> 0:12:21,920
And of course, in my mind, the biggest thing here is we do not have a correlate of immunity

118
0:12:21,920 --> 0:12:27,760
in the antibody test, right? So we keep asking this question, what does it mean if you are vaccinated

119
0:12:27,760 --> 0:12:33,200
and your antibody test is negative? And we still, across the board, say, in general,

120
0:12:33,200 --> 0:12:38,240
don't rush out and get your serology test after vaccination. These vaccinations are incredibly

121
0:12:38,240 --> 0:12:43,760
effective. The conversation I was having with one of the oncologists today is we're not seeing all

122
0:12:43,760 --> 0:12:50,160
these transplant patients, all these people with hematological malignancies who've been

123
0:12:50,160 --> 0:12:55,520
vaccinated ending up in the hospital. So we're actually getting an experience that supports the

124
0:12:55,520 --> 0:13:01,120
efficacy of these vaccines. Another article, and I think this sort of goes into the same area,

125
0:13:01,120 --> 0:13:06,800
on natural infection and protection against reinfection. I have a few comments on this,

126
0:13:06,800 --> 0:13:14,080
but the article is reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 in patients undergoing serial laboratory testing.

127
0:13:14,080 --> 0:13:22,560
This was published in CID. Here, the authors analyzed 9,119 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection

128
0:13:22,560 --> 0:13:28,320
who received serial tests in total of 62 healthcare facilities in the United States

129
0:13:28,320 --> 0:13:37,520
between December 1, 2019 to November 13, 2020. They identified reinfection in 0.7%

130
0:13:38,720 --> 0:13:46,400
during an average mean of 116 days or about four months, and there were two deaths associated

131
0:13:46,400 --> 0:13:54,640
with reinfections. So the reinfections were associated with a 3.2% mortality. A great discussion

132
0:13:54,640 --> 0:14:00,640
here where they compare their data to the 1.8% reinfection rate seen in the UK siren study,

133
0:14:01,360 --> 0:14:06,080
and that had been published in SARS-CoV-2 infection rates of antibody positive,

134
0:14:06,080 --> 0:14:11,680
compared with antibody negative healthcare workers in England, a large multi-center prospective cohort

135
0:14:11,680 --> 0:14:17,840
study siren that had been published in Lancet back in April. So I did find it interesting that

136
0:14:17,840 --> 0:14:22,240
the infection fatality rate was higher than most of us think, right? Most of us are thinking,

137
0:14:22,240 --> 0:14:27,440
well, if you get reinfected, it'll be more mild, but an infection fatality rate of over 3%.

138
0:14:29,040 --> 0:14:35,760
In this case, a couple of people died in this small cohort. We would not only expect with

139
0:14:35,760 --> 0:14:40,080
improved therapeutics and close monitoring, right? These people are being closely monitored and

140
0:14:40,080 --> 0:14:45,840
picked up early. I would not have expected to see deaths in people who've been previously infected,

141
0:14:45,840 --> 0:14:53,360
and vaccines are available. I know the authors use the word only, but my interpretation is that

142
0:14:53,360 --> 0:14:57,360
in about four to five months after infection, we're already seeing reinfections, we're already

143
0:14:57,360 --> 0:15:04,480
seeing deaths. I think the data has continued to support that vaccines are a little bit better

144
0:15:04,480 --> 0:15:10,640
than just natural infection. All right, the period of detectable viral replication,

145
0:15:10,640 --> 0:15:14,800
the viral symptom phase, what I like to say, the time for monitoring and monoclonals,

146
0:15:15,520 --> 0:15:19,200
and I like to add where you get your test is where you should get your monoclonals.

147
0:15:20,080 --> 0:15:26,320
I have a couple things here before we hit monoclonals. So the first is what about antibiotics, right?

148
0:15:26,320 --> 0:15:32,720
We all know a significant amount of antibacterial therapeutics have been given for this viral disease.

149
0:15:32,720 --> 0:15:42,800
So the article, efficacy and safety of Zithromycin in COVID-19 patients, a systematic review and met

150
0:15:42,800 --> 0:15:48,640
analysis of randomized clinical trials was published in reviews of medical virology. Now,

151
0:15:48,640 --> 0:15:58,560
the authors analysis included seven studies with 8,822 patients. The use of a Zithromycin, that is

152
0:15:58,560 --> 0:16:05,120
an antibacterial antibiotic, the Z-pack, which is quite popular here in the US, was not associated

153
0:16:05,120 --> 0:16:11,280
with an impact on mortality in COVID-19 patients. The use of a Zithromycin was not

154
0:16:11,280 --> 0:16:16,640
associated with an impact on need for invasive mechanical ventilation or length of stay.

155
0:16:17,440 --> 0:16:23,440
The results in this rather large study showed that a Zithromycin as routine therapy in COVID-19

156
0:16:23,440 --> 0:16:30,000
patients is not justified due to a lack of efficacy and potential risk of bacterial resistance.

157
0:16:30,000 --> 0:16:34,000
I thought it was interesting because I looked through the comments and one of the comments was

158
0:16:34,000 --> 0:16:37,280
someone said, you know, we already know this and this doesn't add much to the literature.

159
0:16:37,840 --> 0:16:43,120
But unfortunately, as I pointed out, 88% of people with COVID have ended up getting

160
0:16:43,120 --> 0:16:49,920
antibiotic. So unfortunately, no, people seem not to know this. I recently had a conversation

161
0:16:49,920 --> 0:16:54,320
with someone taking care of a patient in India and the comment was, you know, we really had nothing

162
0:16:54,320 --> 0:17:00,480
to give them except for antibiotics. They said, what do you mean except for antibiotics? They're

163
0:17:00,480 --> 0:17:05,520
like, well, we didn't have oxygen. We didn't have steroids. All we had on hand was antibiotics and

164
0:17:05,520 --> 0:17:10,480
we wanted to give them something. Don't give them antibiotics. That is not giving them something.

165
0:17:10,480 --> 0:17:15,360
That's not helpful. That's like giving them HCQ, hydroxychloroquine. You're going to do harm.

166
0:17:15,360 --> 0:17:20,320
You are not being helpful. This concept that only a minority of patients admitted with COVID

167
0:17:20,320 --> 0:17:26,800
have a secondary bacterial infection. We had another article, characterization of bacterial

168
0:17:26,800 --> 0:17:33,600
and fungal infections in hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 and factors associated

169
0:17:33,600 --> 0:17:40,240
with healthcare associated infections. This was published in open forum infectious diseases.

170
0:17:40,240 --> 0:17:45,840
And whenever I read a good article, I always remember Steve Goff giving me a hard time asking me if

171
0:17:45,840 --> 0:17:51,520
that was a real journal. So I want to point out, if Steve is listening, that this was published by

172
0:17:51,520 --> 0:17:58,960
the Columbia infectious disease physicians. They're at this prestigious university, Columbia University.

173
0:17:58,960 --> 0:18:04,560
They're in New York City, Magda, Sobiesik. The head of our department was among the authors.

174
0:18:04,560 --> 0:18:10,720
I was actually presenting to the group this morning. So if anyone's listening, I'm reading and

175
0:18:10,720 --> 0:18:17,040
highlighting your article. My colleagues evaluated adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19 between

176
0:18:17,760 --> 0:18:25,040
the 2nd of March and the 31st of May 2020 that had been hospitalized for greater than 24 hours.

177
0:18:25,760 --> 0:18:33,440
They included a total of over 3,000 patients, community associated co-infections when they were

178
0:18:33,440 --> 0:18:40,480
admitted or identified in only 6% of patients. And this is an important point. This is during

179
0:18:40,480 --> 0:18:47,760
that acute inflammatory phase. This is when they're ending up in the hospital. 94% did not have an

180
0:18:47,760 --> 0:18:55,120
acute bacterial infection that would benefit from antibacterial therapy. Later on, and we've

181
0:18:55,120 --> 0:19:01,440
talked about this before, if you continue in the hospital, you can go on to develop a healthcare

182
0:19:01,440 --> 0:19:07,760
associated infection. This is usually in week 2 or 3 of your hospital stay. They did see that

183
0:19:07,760 --> 0:19:16,240
in 12% of these patients. Most of those infections were gram negative bacteria, but also about 20%

184
0:19:16,240 --> 0:19:22,880
were due to fungi. And then as time went on, they were actually seeing more drug-resistant

185
0:19:22,880 --> 0:19:29,680
organisms causing these. Monoclonals can't leave monoclonals out. There's always a little more data.

186
0:19:29,680 --> 0:19:36,320
The article effect of monoclonal antibody treatment on clinical outcomes in ambulatory patients with

187
0:19:36,320 --> 0:19:43,440
COVID-19, also an open form infectious disease. The authors reported when they compared rates of

188
0:19:43,440 --> 0:19:49,200
emergency department visits or hospitalizations among ambulatory COVID-19 patients treated with

189
0:19:49,200 --> 0:19:58,240
monoclonal antibody. That was an N equals 305 versus untreated. That was 6,354. That treatment was

190
0:19:58,240 --> 0:20:06,320
associated with decreased encounters within 30 days. So odds ratio of 0.23. So about a 77%

191
0:20:06,320 --> 0:20:12,960
reduction. So just we keep hitting on this. The most effective thing we can do, if we have missed

192
0:20:12,960 --> 0:20:18,160
that opportunity to get someone vaccinated, is treatment with monoclonals. And as we mentioned

193
0:20:18,160 --> 0:20:23,600
last time, if they show up at the hospital and they're still serology negative, meaning they do

194
0:20:23,600 --> 0:20:29,520
not yet have detectable antibodies, there may still be some benefit, not this dramatic benefit

195
0:20:29,520 --> 0:20:34,560
we're seeing in that first week, but still a little bit in some patients. Early inflammatory

196
0:20:34,560 --> 0:20:42,240
phase, we did get a press release from Gilead. And this was Gilead's remdesivir. I've actually

197
0:20:42,240 --> 0:20:48,400
replaced their brand name with remdesivir all throughout this, but associated with a reduction

198
0:20:48,400 --> 0:20:54,640
in mortality rate in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 across three analyses of large

199
0:20:54,640 --> 0:21:01,280
retrospective real world data sets. So real world evidence from nearly 100,000 hospitalized

200
0:21:01,280 --> 0:21:06,560
patients provides clinical insights on the use of remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19.

201
0:21:07,520 --> 0:21:11,840
Now this was data was presented at World Microbe Forum. Vincent, I don't know if you were at

202
0:21:11,840 --> 0:21:18,720
if you attended World Microbe Forum. He's shaking head no. Okay. Well, at that

203
0:21:20,080 --> 0:21:29,040
forum, they presented three real world data analysis that included 98,654 patients hospitalized

204
0:21:29,040 --> 0:21:35,120
with COVID-19. So let's let's run through the three trials. So one was the double pine placebo

205
0:21:35,120 --> 0:21:44,000
controlled adaptive COVID-19 treatment trial. So that's ACTT1. And this was looking at hospitalized

206
0:21:44,000 --> 0:21:54,000
patients with COVID-19. There was a trend toward reduced mortality, 11% versus 15%. And the remdesivir

207
0:21:54,000 --> 0:22:00,800
treated patients. So that was an N of 541 compared with the placebo N equals 521. Now in the overall

208
0:22:00,800 --> 0:22:06,320
study population, a trend means this was not statistically significant looking at over 1,000

209
0:22:06,320 --> 0:22:12,960
treated patients. But then they went and did a post hoc analysis. And in this post hoc analysis,

210
0:22:12,960 --> 0:22:19,360
remember this data mining, as I like to say, patients requiring low flow oxygen at baseline

211
0:22:19,360 --> 0:22:26,240
achieved a 70% reduction in mortality that they did claim was statistically significant.

212
0:22:26,240 --> 0:22:32,080
The difference in mortality in the other subgroups was not statistically significant.

213
0:22:32,080 --> 0:22:37,680
I think this plays into our practice, right? We are not giving remdesivir and not

214
0:22:38,240 --> 0:22:44,000
recommending remdesivir for people who come in without the requirement of low flow oxygen.

215
0:22:44,000 --> 0:22:47,360
And we already have some data we were concerned about there once they progress,

216
0:22:47,360 --> 0:22:51,280
once they end up in the ICU or a ventilator that maybe they do worse.

217
0:22:51,280 --> 0:22:58,240
Then we have the real world retrospective comparative analysis from the premier healthcare

218
0:22:58,240 --> 0:23:03,360
database. This looked at mortality and hospitalized patients who were treated with remdesivir.

219
0:23:03,360 --> 0:23:11,760
Bigger numbers here, N equals 28,855 versus matched patients who were not treated. Those were the

220
0:23:11,760 --> 0:23:21,120
N of 16,687. And this looked between August and November of 2020. So the analysis included

221
0:23:21,120 --> 0:23:26,400
adult hospitalized patients treated within the first two days. Patients were matched on

222
0:23:26,400 --> 0:23:32,800
baseline level of oxygenation. And they all stayed in the hospital for a minimum of three days.

223
0:23:32,800 --> 0:23:38,720
The primary endpoint was time to death. And in this large analysis, they report that they saw a

224
0:23:38,720 --> 0:23:45,760
significantly lower risk of mortality in patients that got remdesivir versus those that not across

225
0:23:45,760 --> 0:23:50,160
all severity levels, right? So people coming in with low amounts of oxygen, higher amounts of

226
0:23:50,160 --> 0:23:58,000
oxygen, et cetera. And finally, they referred in this press release to the simple severe study,

227
0:23:58,000 --> 0:24:03,760
which is a randomized open label, multi-center phase three study and hospitalized adult patients

228
0:24:03,760 --> 0:24:10,480
with severe COVID-19, oxygen saturation less than 94% on room air, or receiving supplemental

229
0:24:10,480 --> 0:24:16,720
oxygen and radiological evidence of pneumonia. As the primary objective of the study, five-day

230
0:24:16,720 --> 0:24:21,120
and 10-day dosing durations of remdesivir, they did not include a standard of care

231
0:24:21,120 --> 0:24:26,560
comparator arm when they initially set this up. But then ahead, the retrospective real-world

232
0:24:26,560 --> 0:24:32,320
analysis that was presented at the WMF compared mortality outcomes of hospitalized patients who

233
0:24:32,320 --> 0:24:39,040
received remdesivir in the open label extension phase, right? So they continued this study into

234
0:24:39,040 --> 0:24:48,960
an open label extension phase. Here we had in that an N of 1,974, and then they created a propensity

235
0:24:48,960 --> 0:24:57,120
score weighted comparator arm. Patients not treated with remdesivir was an N of 1,426.

236
0:24:57,120 --> 0:25:04,080
The primary endpoint was time to all cause death, and the analysis found that in the overall population,

237
0:25:04,080 --> 0:25:08,960
treatment with remdesivir was associated with a statistically significant mortality risk,

238
0:25:08,960 --> 0:25:14,320
at 28 days versus those not treated, again, regardless of the baseline oxygen requirement.

239
0:25:14,320 --> 0:25:18,800
So getting just a little bit, I'm starting to feel a little bit better about all the

240
0:25:18,800 --> 0:25:25,440
money and resources we're putting on remdesivir, but these are huge numbers needed to show a

241
0:25:25,440 --> 0:25:35,360
significant impact. So do you use remdesivir on your patient? So we still do, and there's really

242
0:25:35,360 --> 0:25:42,720
a window in a sense of when we consider it, and so this is not giving it to every patient who walks

243
0:25:42,720 --> 0:25:48,400
in the door, only patients who have an oxygen requirement or are oxygen saturation less than

244
0:25:48,400 --> 0:25:53,680
94% in room air, and then not giving it to people with advanced disease who require mechanical

245
0:25:53,680 --> 0:25:58,640
ventilation. But in that little window, we are doing five days of treatment. And I guess I'll

246
0:25:58,640 --> 0:26:02,160
throw in the caveat, Vincent, if that person is getting better, we're not keeping him in the

247
0:26:02,160 --> 0:26:06,320
hospital for that extra day for day five. If they're getting better, we let them go,

248
0:26:07,200 --> 0:26:13,360
again, not feeling like that extra day in the hospital is worth getting an extra one or two days

249
0:26:13,360 --> 0:26:17,120
of remdesivir. But at the same time, you're probably giving them monoclonals, right?

250
0:26:17,840 --> 0:26:22,880
Well, so that's the challenge, right? So again, it's all back to our timing. If they show up

251
0:26:22,880 --> 0:26:27,840
within the first seven to 10 days, we're giving them monoclonals and a 70%, 80% reduction in them

252
0:26:27,840 --> 0:26:33,360
even coming to the hospital. If they do come to the hospital, the data would now say if they

253
0:26:33,360 --> 0:26:38,160
show up and there's still serology negative have yet to mount an antibody response, monoclonals are

254
0:26:38,160 --> 0:26:44,320
still potentially of some benefit. But that's the group that we're looking at at remdesivir.

255
0:26:44,320 --> 0:26:48,080
So it's after the first week, we're getting into the second week, they're starting to get some

256
0:26:48,080 --> 0:26:52,000
degree of hypoxemia. That's when we're giving them remdesivir. Got it.

257
0:26:52,800 --> 0:26:56,160
It is interesting, right? Because you would think we'd want to give it during that first week.

258
0:26:56,160 --> 0:27:01,760
Yes. You know, right? It's an antiviral. Let's give it when they have. But interesting enough,

259
0:27:01,760 --> 0:27:07,440
we have not been able to show. And I think it's because we don't know in that group, right? 97%

260
0:27:07,440 --> 0:27:12,880
of people are going to survive probably 80% or not even going to progress to need the hospital.

261
0:27:12,880 --> 0:27:17,600
So you end up treating so many people who probably don't need exposure to remdesivir.

262
0:27:17,600 --> 0:27:22,000
So now I'm going to jump to the long phase, long COVID. I'm going to try to keep these

263
0:27:22,000 --> 0:27:25,920
down to 30 minutes. People have been letting me know we've been getting a little long.

264
0:27:26,960 --> 0:27:30,880
And then maybe that's okay. Here we are at long COVID. But a couple things I want to say at the

265
0:27:30,880 --> 0:27:35,760
end. And this is really important. If you're a clinician, pause it here, get yourself a pen and

266
0:27:35,760 --> 0:27:42,480
some paper, be ready to go back to this. It's really critical for us as far as long COVID to

267
0:27:42,480 --> 0:27:49,040
know who has it. And this, as silly as it seems, we need to have this coded so that people can look

268
0:27:49,040 --> 0:27:54,720
through and see, hey, we're starting to see a lot of people with long COVID. So what have we heard?

269
0:27:54,720 --> 0:28:02,080
I talked a little bit about this last time is we got some guidance from the CDC. So we have a code

270
0:28:02,080 --> 0:28:10,640
on the horizon. This is U09.9 post COVID-19 condition code, not yet available in the US,

271
0:28:10,640 --> 0:28:17,040
but we expect it to be available in October 2021. In the meantime, when you see someone

272
0:28:17,040 --> 0:28:23,280
more than four weeks after acute COVID, they're still continuing to suffer. The CDC is recommending

273
0:28:23,280 --> 0:28:31,360
we use the code B 94.8 sequelae of other specified infectious and parasitic diseases.

274
0:28:32,400 --> 0:28:37,440
We really need to start tracking who are these people? Where are they? What resources do they need?

275
0:28:38,160 --> 0:28:44,400
This is really a huge issue. It's a huge issue for the millions of people that are still suffering.

276
0:28:44,400 --> 0:28:49,520
It's a huge issue for the employers. It's a huge issue for us as a society. So it's really

277
0:28:49,520 --> 0:28:53,760
important that we're able to identify who these people are so that we can connect them with the

278
0:28:53,760 --> 0:29:00,480
resources they need. And one of the resources they need is research. And so I do want to offer a

279
0:29:00,480 --> 0:29:06,240
bit of hope to all these individuals suffering with long COVID. It's unfortunate that this is

280
0:29:06,240 --> 0:29:11,200
impacting so many people, but the other side of that is it is impacting so many people. This

281
0:29:11,200 --> 0:29:18,000
cannot and will not be ignored. There's a tremendous amount of research and medical attention being

282
0:29:18,000 --> 0:29:25,040
put on this topic. So I'm really optimistic in the coming months. We'll be sort of shifting

283
0:29:25,040 --> 0:29:30,480
some of our discussion away from vaccinations and monoclonals to what are the therapeutics

284
0:29:30,480 --> 0:29:35,440
for these individuals who got COVID before we could prevent it or even who got COVID after we

285
0:29:35,440 --> 0:29:41,280
could prevent it and are still suffering from long COVID. So before we hit emails, I will say

286
0:29:42,080 --> 0:29:48,000
please take a moment. Through the months of May, June and July, we are continuing to

287
0:29:48,960 --> 0:29:54,320
help support Foundation International Medical Relief of Children. They operate throughout the

288
0:29:54,320 --> 0:30:02,960
world, South America, the Pacific, India, Africa. These places are really having a tough time.

289
0:30:02,960 --> 0:30:07,600
You know, when you're planning that big celebration, maybe take a moment and send a few

290
0:30:07,600 --> 0:30:12,080
dollars to parasites without borders so we can continue to help.

291
0:30:13,360 --> 0:30:18,400
Daniel, what happened to the observation in the long COVID patients that vaccination

292
0:30:18,400 --> 0:30:25,680
seemed to help some of them? So we are still seeing that in about 40% of patients. I should

293
0:30:25,680 --> 0:30:33,920
mention that they are doing a study up at Yale, COVIDRecovery, at Yale.edu. I'm waiting for a

294
0:30:33,920 --> 0:30:38,000
little bit more science, but we just keep seeing this clinically. We're seeing not quite half,

295
0:30:38,000 --> 0:30:44,080
but a little less than half of patients who have the brain fog, the loss of smell, the fatigue.

296
0:30:44,080 --> 0:30:48,080
You know, if you have pulmonary scarring, if you've had heart damage, if you had a stroke,

297
0:30:48,080 --> 0:30:52,640
the vaccine isn't going to is going to undo the permanent damage. But it continues to be

298
0:30:52,640 --> 0:30:57,280
encouraging seeing patients that have had this. I guess the next question, I think about the

299
0:30:57,280 --> 0:31:03,120
renal transplant, the people that, you know, 25% got better with the first dose. We get up to 40%

300
0:31:03,120 --> 0:31:08,160
with the second dose. Do we give them a third dose? I'm looking forward to studies on that.

301
0:31:08,160 --> 0:31:13,920
And also, this will be an interesting population to look at, do antivirals work in these people?

302
0:31:13,920 --> 0:31:18,960
Is this being driven by viral persistence? Or is it a pure immunological issue? So

303
0:31:18,960 --> 0:31:21,760
I'm looking forward to some more insights into this.

304
0:31:22,400 --> 0:31:28,160
Time for some email questions. If you'd like to send one to Daniel, it's Daniel at microbe.tv.

305
0:31:28,880 --> 0:31:33,840
Jenny writes, I got J&J vaccine back in March. Recently, I heard on the news that J&J vaccine

306
0:31:33,840 --> 0:31:39,360
is less effective against Delta variant than any two dose vaccines. I'm wondering if I should

307
0:31:39,360 --> 0:31:44,160
consider getting a second dose Pfizer Moderna to increase my protection against Delta variant from

308
0:31:44,160 --> 0:31:51,440
60 to 80%. So that's, I have to say, that's a great question. And a lot of people are asking it.

309
0:31:52,800 --> 0:31:55,280
The party line, I'm going to give you the party line first, but then we'll go into the

310
0:31:55,280 --> 0:32:01,200
week. So the party line is all of these vaccines are incredibly effective. Even should you get

311
0:32:01,200 --> 0:32:06,720
COVID after vaccination, it goes from being a severe life threatening disease to maybe the

312
0:32:06,720 --> 0:32:12,960
sniffle, something mild in most cases. The subtleties would be, if you said, oh, but I'm 80 years old,

313
0:32:12,960 --> 0:32:17,600
and I have multiple comorbidities, and I'm homebound and I don't have a good care network,

314
0:32:17,600 --> 0:32:22,160
then you start thinking about it. But in general, the vaccines are all incredibly

315
0:32:22,160 --> 0:32:27,440
effective. We're not recommending that someone who is vaccinated with J&J go ahead and get an

316
0:32:27,440 --> 0:32:32,880
mRNA vaccine. David writes, I'm especially vulnerable to COVID as the result of age

317
0:32:32,880 --> 0:32:37,600
in a number of underlying conditions that was vaccinated in February was beginning to feel

318
0:32:37,600 --> 0:32:42,880
freer in what I could do until I read a newspaper article reporting on a study finding that even

319
0:32:42,880 --> 0:32:47,440
low doses of prednisone could dramatically reduce antibody production from the vaccine.

320
0:32:47,440 --> 0:32:53,440
I was taking five migs of prednisone at the time. I was vaccinated for an autoimmune lung disease.

321
0:32:53,440 --> 0:32:58,000
I took the antibody test and the result was that there were no detectable antibodies.

322
0:32:58,000 --> 0:33:03,040
My doctor informs me that I probably still have some protection through other mechanisms,

323
0:33:03,040 --> 0:33:07,520
but there's no way of knowing if this is the case or how significant the other protections are.

324
0:33:07,520 --> 0:33:11,680
Dr. prescribing prednisone has told me I could stop it temporarily to get

325
0:33:11,680 --> 0:33:16,160
re-vaccinated. If I do this and then resume the prednisone, are the antibodies likely to be

326
0:33:16,160 --> 0:33:19,920
suppressed? Is there any way of measuring what degree of protection I have absent

327
0:33:19,920 --> 0:33:25,680
measurable antibodies? Any advice for me? We keep hitting on this with the literature,

328
0:33:25,680 --> 0:33:30,480
and I keep bringing up these articles because people really care. We have a majority of our adult

329
0:33:30,480 --> 0:33:36,080
population now vaccinated, and people want to know did it work. A lot of our other vaccines have

330
0:33:36,080 --> 0:33:41,600
titis B. Even though we don't think it's the antibodies that give you the protection, we think of it as a correlate.

331
0:33:41,600 --> 0:33:45,680
You can measure that. A lot of people are asking these questions. A couple of things I'll say

332
0:33:45,680 --> 0:33:50,000
they're encouraging. One is five milligrams of prednisone is actually quite a low dose

333
0:33:50,880 --> 0:33:56,480
compared to what we're seeing in other populations. As I mentioned my discussion with the oncologist,

334
0:33:56,480 --> 0:34:01,600
we are not seeing a lot of individuals like you end up coming in as vaccine breakthroughs that

335
0:34:01,600 --> 0:34:08,240
end up in the hospital. We do think that the vaccines continue to be quite effective.

336
0:34:08,240 --> 0:34:12,880
Now, what about your doctor's strategy that he's bringing up? Stopping the prednisone for a

337
0:34:12,880 --> 0:34:18,080
period of time, let's say two or three weeks, getting vaccinated. This is something we did a lot of

338
0:34:18,080 --> 0:34:24,000
times upfront as if we could. We would stop immunosuppressive medicines. We would have a person get vaccinated,

339
0:34:24,000 --> 0:34:28,400
and then once they had finished the series, then they would potentially be resumed.

340
0:34:28,400 --> 0:34:34,560
I think that's a reasonable strategy, but again, it gets back to this issue. The vaccines are

341
0:34:34,560 --> 0:34:41,280
incredibly effective. We are not seeing individuals like you end up in the hospital. So maybe we're

342
0:34:41,280 --> 0:34:46,160
still underselling the vaccines across the board. The incidence is going down. The prevalence is

343
0:34:46,160 --> 0:34:51,600
going down. This is getting to be a safer time. At least for the next couple months, you have some

344
0:34:51,600 --> 0:34:56,640
time to think about this. If we start seeing rates go up or let's say you live in an area with a

345
0:34:56,640 --> 0:34:59,440
high prevalence, that's going to be a slightly different metric.

346
0:35:00,480 --> 0:35:06,240
Finally, Mark writes, I'm a clinician and past clinical researcher who's been involved with

347
0:35:06,240 --> 0:35:11,920
chronic fatigue syndrome since the mid-80s. I've seen and helped manage around 5-6,000 people with

348
0:35:11,920 --> 0:35:17,760
CFS all the way from near permanently bedbound patients to impaired Olympic athletes in both

349
0:35:17,760 --> 0:35:23,920
inpatient and outpatient settings. The story of many long COVID patients is, to me, indistinguishable

350
0:35:23,920 --> 0:35:30,640
from my post-IBV, post-Dangy, and post-Rosse river viral cases here in Australia. In many of these,

351
0:35:30,640 --> 0:35:37,360
a specific viral IgM remains raised, and abnormalities of tick lymphocytes keep supporting a hypothesis

352
0:35:37,360 --> 0:35:42,720
of persistent immune failure to bring the infection to an end. The few COVID-19 patients with persistent

353
0:35:42,720 --> 0:35:47,040
symptoms I have seen show the same immunology changes, although I know that this is a very

354
0:35:47,040 --> 0:35:52,560
small sample and likely selection bias. We'd have very few cases in Australia so far,

355
0:35:52,560 --> 0:35:56,560
but that will change with opening of our borders and our low vaccination rates.

356
0:35:56,560 --> 0:36:02,320
My question is, could long COVID be a specific instance of CFS? No diagnostic tests, a wide range

357
0:36:02,320 --> 0:36:07,920
of symptoms and disability? No clear mechanism identified a lack of disease, classification,

358
0:36:07,920 --> 0:36:13,680
impairing care? You raised dysautonomia as one component, and this is especially common in

359
0:36:13,680 --> 0:36:19,440
young people with CFS. Treatment for postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome POTS is well

360
0:36:19,440 --> 0:36:25,040
established and does provide considerable reduction of disability for many while we await deeper

361
0:36:25,040 --> 0:36:31,120
understanding of these conditions. Cheers from Australia. So these are actually really excellent

362
0:36:31,120 --> 0:36:37,040
points all across the board, and there certainly are similarities in this population. One of the

363
0:36:37,040 --> 0:36:45,360
things we learned from the CFS population was that a subset, if you try to just exercise them

364
0:36:45,360 --> 0:36:49,760
up, so to speak, rehabilitate them treated as an issue of deconditioning. You actually can make

365
0:36:49,760 --> 0:36:56,160
them worse. So we see a very similar pattern in a subset of these patients. The POTS, the

366
0:36:56,160 --> 0:37:02,720
dysautonomia, there actually are a lot of similarities between these populations. That might be good,

367
0:37:02,720 --> 0:37:09,280
it might be bad. One of the troubles we realize is that there was a lot of research at one point

368
0:37:09,280 --> 0:37:16,400
looking at CFS, trying to figure out what was going on, trying to introduce helpful therapies,

369
0:37:16,400 --> 0:37:20,640
and we did not make a lot of headway. So I know some people are looking at this and saying,

370
0:37:20,640 --> 0:37:27,040
oh my gosh, is this the next CFS. But here's the big difference when I have those conversations,

371
0:37:27,040 --> 0:37:31,680
is people got this all at the same time. I'm actually hoping it's the other way,

372
0:37:31,680 --> 0:37:36,880
is that now, since we had a large number of people get infected at the same time, we all sort of know

373
0:37:36,880 --> 0:37:43,520
when the onset was, that we're going to get insights into long COVID that can allow us to go back to

374
0:37:43,520 --> 0:37:48,800
the chronic fatigue syndrome patients. I do suspect there at least are certain patients that have

375
0:37:48,800 --> 0:37:54,320
similar mechanisms underlying this. I was going to throw chicken guñas, another one of those post

376
0:37:54,320 --> 0:38:01,120
viral syndromes that we see. So yeah, I continue to be optimistic, but I think everything you said

377
0:38:01,120 --> 0:38:08,960
there was really insightful. That's COVID-19 clinical update number 68 with Dr. Daniel Griffin.

378
0:38:08,960 --> 0:38:38,800
Thank you, Daniel. Thank you, Vincent. Thank you, everyone, and be safe.
