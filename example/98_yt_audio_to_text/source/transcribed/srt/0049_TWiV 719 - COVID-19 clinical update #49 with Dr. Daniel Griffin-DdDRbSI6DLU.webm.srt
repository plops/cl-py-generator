0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:06,880
This week in virology, the podcast about viruses, the kind that make you sick.

2
0:00:10,320 --> 0:00:20,240
From Microbe TV, this is Twiv, this week in virology, episode 719 recorded on February 11,

3
0:00:20,240 --> 0:00:27,600
2021. I'm Vincent Racken Yello, and you're listening to the podcast all about viruses.

4
0:00:27,600 --> 0:00:34,400
Joining me today from New York, Daniel Griffin. Hello, everyone. All right, we're a week later.

5
0:00:34,400 --> 0:00:41,440
Is it any better, Daniel? You know, I am going to say yes. I'm going to say I'm

6
0:00:41,440 --> 0:00:47,040
apparently I'm going to be on the news tonight at 7.30, after we finish Twiv. And I am going to say

7
0:00:47,040 --> 0:00:53,520
then, you know, this will be dropped Saturday. So people won't know that I'm going to say

8
0:00:53,520 --> 0:00:59,040
that we've really come over our crest. I mean, we were looking at over 300,000 new cases a day.

9
0:00:59,600 --> 0:01:06,160
We crested over 5,000 deaths per day. And now we've dropped down to less than 200,000 cases

10
0:01:06,160 --> 0:01:12,240
per day. And our deaths are actually getting down in the 2000s again, which is, you know,

11
0:01:12,240 --> 0:01:17,520
horrible to say that that's better than where we were. And what's the reason for this downturn,

12
0:01:17,520 --> 0:01:22,320
do we know? I think there's several things going on, Vincent. I think one of them is that,

13
0:01:22,320 --> 0:01:26,960
you know, if you become infected, when you're infecting 300,000 people a day, you're taking

14
0:01:26,960 --> 0:01:31,440
300,000 people who are probably not going to get reinfected in the next three or four months or so.

15
0:01:32,000 --> 0:01:37,360
We're also ramping up vaccines, you know, over a million people are being vaccinated a day.

16
0:01:37,360 --> 0:01:43,040
The other thing is we got past Christmas, New Year's, we got past all those big holiday times. So,

17
0:01:43,040 --> 0:01:48,000
you know, and I understand it was a really bad Super Bowl. So hopefully we won't see much of a

18
0:01:48,000 --> 0:01:52,160
surge after that. Okay, we've got a lot to cover today. And actually, I'm going to say

19
0:01:52,160 --> 0:01:58,800
exciting new news, hot off the press we'll talk about today. But let me start off with my quotation.

20
0:01:59,600 --> 0:02:05,200
And this is a quotation from the Great Gatsby by F Scott Fitzgerald, one of my favorite books.

21
0:02:05,200 --> 0:02:12,560
People may not know, but I live in East Ag and I look across at West Ag where Gatsby was when he

22
0:02:13,440 --> 0:02:19,600
Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgasmic future that year by year recedes before us.

23
0:02:19,600 --> 0:02:26,560
It eluded us then, but that's no matter. Tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther,

24
0:02:26,560 --> 0:02:34,400
and then one fine morning. So we beat on boats against the current, born ceaselessly into the past,

25
0:02:34,400 --> 0:02:40,640
born back ceaselessly into the past. So all right, never miss an opportunity to vaccinate,

26
0:02:40,640 --> 0:02:46,560
never miss an opportunity to test, never waste a vaccine dose. I hope everyone survived last

27
0:02:46,560 --> 0:02:51,840
week's discussion of the variants. And yes, it was simplified. I left out the trimmers and

28
0:02:51,840 --> 0:02:57,920
fear and cleavage sites and pre and post fusion confirmation changes. But my hope is that this

29
0:02:57,920 --> 0:03:03,760
primer will help as we go forward. You know, I was thinking today, as I went in and one of my

30
0:03:03,760 --> 0:03:09,600
patients had not made it through the night, how lucky we were when we talked about the Irish

31
0:03:09,600 --> 0:03:14,400
patient that we got to follow his drama through not knowing how it was going to go and then see

32
0:03:14,400 --> 0:03:20,080
him end up back home in Colorado. But unfortunately, that is not the outcome that all my patients

33
0:03:20,080 --> 0:03:25,760
are experiencing. All right, the pre exposure period. So my stages paper is now published. It's

34
0:03:25,760 --> 0:03:31,200
out there. I don't know if the full it's going to be open access to the full paper will be available

35
0:03:31,200 --> 0:03:38,560
soon. But we're going to stick with these stages, the pre exposure period. So now two masks at a

36
0:03:38,560 --> 0:03:46,000
time are being recommended or discussed by the CDC. In the MMWR, there was maximizing fit for

37
0:03:46,000 --> 0:03:51,680
cloth and medical procedure mass to improve performance and reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission

38
0:03:51,680 --> 0:04:00,720
and exposure 2021 in the MMWR. Testing, I want to say I have growing concerns about the reduction

39
0:04:00,720 --> 0:04:06,720
in testing. I was looking at the COVID tracking project and they had reported that if there was

40
0:04:06,720 --> 0:04:13,600
a significant drop in testing, I was able to confirm this in other sources. On January 18th,

41
0:04:13,600 --> 0:04:19,840
the seven day average of daily new tests reached an all time high of over 2 million. Just to kind

42
0:04:19,840 --> 0:04:25,520
of give people perspective, January 18th, one slash 20 was the Biden inauguration. That number

43
0:04:25,520 --> 0:04:31,680
has now fallen well below that 2 million number. And that 2 million number is actually what our

44
0:04:31,680 --> 0:04:37,680
public health experts consider an important threshold for allowing us to identify most of

45
0:04:37,680 --> 0:04:43,680
the people with symptoms really to prevent them from spreading it to other individuals.

46
0:04:43,680 --> 0:04:51,680
You know, in New York here locally, the 15th of January is when we reached our peak with 324,671

47
0:04:51,680 --> 0:04:59,680
tests done in a single day. We're now seeing half that number, less than 200,000

48
0:04:59,680 --> 0:05:07,680
really about 150,000 done per day. So we're really dropping. It was about a year ago that Michael

49
0:05:07,680 --> 0:05:13,680
Mina started championing the idea of the home saliva, rapid saliva test, the liquor sticks,

50
0:05:13,680 --> 0:05:19,680
a dollar or less. He was a guest on Twiv back in 640, Twiv 640 back in July.

51
0:05:19,680 --> 0:05:27,680
Now there are several at home collection COVID tests. Most of them are male back offs. They're not

52
0:05:27,680 --> 0:05:32,800
really doing the full thing. But back in December, a loom. This is an Australian based company

53
0:05:32,800 --> 0:05:39,040
received an EUA for their 15 minute rapid in home antigen test. And recently, the White House

54
0:05:39,040 --> 0:05:46,960
announced that the Department of Defense has committed $230.8 million to help a loom increase

55
0:05:46,960 --> 0:05:54,080
its production of these at home tests. As per the loom CEO, Sean Parsons, we certainly would

56
0:05:54,080 --> 0:05:59,120
like to see this priced in the $30 range. But he admits it will definitely start at more than

57
0:05:59,120 --> 0:06:06,400
that $30 per test. That's a lot of money. So really not quite where I would like to see it be.

58
0:06:07,200 --> 0:06:13,760
Active vaccination, I'm going to call this the good, the bad and the ugly. The ugly is all the

59
0:06:13,760 --> 0:06:19,200
equity with access. The bad as we've really created a system that made access to vaccination,

60
0:06:19,200 --> 0:06:25,280
very complicated, frustrating. And by its very nature, easier for wealthy, healthy and more

61
0:06:25,280 --> 0:06:31,040
educated to access. The good though is that it does look like this is about to turn around

62
0:06:31,040 --> 0:06:37,120
and improve at least for the US. I'm hoping the rest of the world after that. But the CDC has a

63
0:06:37,120 --> 0:06:45,600
COVID-19 vaccine data tracker. And actually, we're really seeing the number ramp up of vaccines

64
0:06:45,600 --> 0:06:53,280
per day. It's over a million per day. Here in New York, we are below average. We're bottom

65
0:06:53,280 --> 0:06:57,600
dwellers. We're in the bottom half. Alaska is doing the best. Nevada is doing the worst.

66
0:06:57,600 --> 0:07:02,720
Based upon percent of doses received and then being administered, we have places like North

67
0:07:02,720 --> 0:07:10,800
Dakota, where 95% of the doses end up administered. In New York, we're down. Only about 70% of the

68
0:07:10,800 --> 0:07:16,080
doses delivered are administered, about 30% of them. So about a third of them end up sitting in

69
0:07:16,080 --> 0:07:22,320
freezers. But we expect this to turn around soon. Just give people, you know, it is February on the

70
0:07:22,320 --> 0:07:30,640
26th, J&J is going to be going for EUA. And we are hoping that by April, the supply outstrips

71
0:07:30,640 --> 0:07:37,120
demand. Moderna has ramped up its production and deliveries. Pfizer has reported a doubling of

72
0:07:37,120 --> 0:07:42,400
its production per month by having its production time through increased efficiencies. A nice

73
0:07:42,400 --> 0:07:47,360
story about that USA today this last week. I do want to share some concerning developments if

74
0:07:47,360 --> 0:07:53,200
people are not watching what's happening down in Manasse, Brazil. And this was a situation where

75
0:07:53,840 --> 0:08:00,240
the first wave of the virus ran rampant. Really, there was a decision made. And what ended up

76
0:08:00,240 --> 0:08:05,760
happening was it ran through. About 5% or 6% of the population died. It was mostly the older,

77
0:08:05,760 --> 0:08:12,400
the more vulnerable. By October 2020, there's a nice Lancet article on this called resurgence

78
0:08:12,400 --> 0:08:18,080
of COVID-19 in the NOSF Brazil, despite high seroprevalence. And as they report in the Lancet,

79
0:08:18,080 --> 0:08:27,280
by October 2020, 76% of the population that was still alive was deemed infected, previously

80
0:08:27,280 --> 0:08:34,320
infected based on serological testing. But now we're seeing an increase. We're seeing a second wave.

81
0:08:34,320 --> 0:08:41,040
This time, the hospitalization rate is 2.5 times what we saw with the first wave. We're seeing a

82
0:08:41,040 --> 0:08:47,360
20% higher per day mortality than happened the first time. And the surge is so large that hospitals

83
0:08:47,360 --> 0:08:52,640
have run out of oxygen. And patients on ventilators who need extraction debris are literally suffocating

84
0:08:52,640 --> 0:08:59,600
in hospital beds. So not much of an endorsement for this, you know, Great Barrington. Let's try

85
0:08:59,600 --> 0:09:04,800
to achieve herd immunity with natural infection. I'm going to get to the next question. Still in

86
0:09:04,800 --> 0:09:10,960
the vaccine section, does vaccination impact transmission? And we just this week, there was

87
0:09:10,960 --> 0:09:17,520
an update from the CDC where they actually do couch this. So I will comment, but they say vaccinated

88
0:09:17,520 --> 0:09:24,880
persons with an exposure to someone with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 are not required to quarantine

89
0:09:24,880 --> 0:09:30,720
if they meet the following criteria, right? So this is a change. If they're fully vaccinated,

90
0:09:30,720 --> 0:09:36,960
so they passed two weeks following the receipt of that second dose in a two dose series. But they're

91
0:09:36,960 --> 0:09:40,800
also kind of getting ready. They're saying we're greater than two weeks following receipt of one

92
0:09:40,800 --> 0:09:46,240
dose of a single dose vaccine. I think they're thinking J and J might get approved. They're within

93
0:09:46,240 --> 0:09:53,200
three months of the receipt of the last dose in the series. And they're remaining asymptomatic.

94
0:09:53,200 --> 0:09:58,240
And that's up on the CDC website. And they actually they they catch this and they explain they say,

95
0:09:58,240 --> 0:10:04,480
okay, although the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from vaccinated persons to others is still uncertain,

96
0:10:04,480 --> 0:10:07,920
vaccination has been demonstrated to prevent symptomatic COVID-19.

97
0:10:08,560 --> 0:10:13,200
Symptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission is thought to have a greater role in transmission

98
0:10:13,200 --> 0:10:18,240
than purely a symptomatic transmission. And additionally, individual and societal benefits

99
0:10:18,240 --> 0:10:24,400
of avoiding unnecessary quarantine may outweigh the potential but unknown risk of transmission

100
0:10:24,400 --> 0:10:29,120
and facilitate the direction of public health resources to persons at highest risk

101
0:10:29,120 --> 0:10:35,200
for transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to others. So this is a bit of a change. This is a bit of an update.

102
0:10:36,320 --> 0:10:42,640
I kept hearing about transmission evidence out of Israel. And on the 8th, the paper,

103
0:10:42,640 --> 0:10:49,360
initial real world evidence for lower viral load of individuals who have been vaccinated by

104
0:10:49,360 --> 0:10:59,200
BNT162b2 became available on GitHub. So two things. Well, the BNT162b2, that's the Pfizer vaccine.

105
0:10:59,200 --> 0:11:06,480
And what is GitHub? This is actually interesting. This was a website originally set up for developers

106
0:11:06,480 --> 0:11:10,720
and companies to share and maintain software. I actually used it when I was writing one of our

107
0:11:10,720 --> 0:11:15,920
textbooks. It's sort of a way to share files, but sort of interesting. Another way for things to

108
0:11:15,920 --> 0:11:21,680
just get out there. And what they reported here, and I don't want to spend too much time on this,

109
0:11:22,240 --> 0:11:28,720
because they report that there was a drop in the average CT values when they looked at people

110
0:11:28,720 --> 0:11:36,160
over a certain age with a 75% vaccination penetrance versus people at a lower age with a lower vaccination

111
0:11:36,160 --> 0:11:42,080
penetrance. But they actually should have, I think, called this statistically significant,

112
0:11:42,080 --> 0:11:48,160
because what they really came out to was instead of about a 26.5, they were seeing CT values of

113
0:11:48,160 --> 0:11:55,760
about 27.5. So only one CT value difference. So instead of an average RNA copy number of

114
0:11:56,880 --> 0:12:03,280
800,000, they're seeing an RNA copy number of 400,000 on average. So still in a level where

115
0:12:03,280 --> 0:12:09,440
we think there's transmission. So I think this is a complicated issue, or we'll learn more about it.

116
0:12:10,320 --> 0:12:17,040
All right, still in this pre-exposure period, we continue to recommend that people exercise,

117
0:12:17,600 --> 0:12:25,280
no reason to go into a COVID exposure vitamin deficient. There actually was a paper in the

118
0:12:25,280 --> 0:12:30,560
Lancet, Diabetes and Endocrinology, entitled Vitamin D and COVID-19, Why the Controversy.

119
0:12:30,560 --> 0:12:35,920
And I guess I'm all along lines with this. I don't think anyone is going to propose that we do a

120
0:12:35,920 --> 0:12:40,240
study where you have half the group vitamin D deficient and the other replete. I think across

121
0:12:40,240 --> 0:12:45,600
the board, there is no reason to be vitamin D deficient. So I think that that can just be closed. Take

122
0:12:45,600 --> 0:12:52,000
your vitamin D, don't be vitamin D deficient, exercise, don't put on extra pounds, those pandemic

123
0:12:52,000 --> 0:12:58,160
pounds, be careful, try to be as healthy as you can. Passive vaccination. This was exciting,

124
0:12:58,160 --> 0:13:05,600
another exciting week. Lily's bamlinibamab, administered with atessa bamab, received FDA

125
0:13:05,600 --> 0:13:13,440
EUA for COVID-19. So this is now Eli Lilly has a cocktail as well, and it gets even more exciting.

126
0:13:13,440 --> 0:13:20,080
If you give just bamlinibamab, instead of an hour, you can infuse it over 16 minutes. If you do the

127
0:13:20,080 --> 0:13:27,840
cocktail, 21 minutes. So this is really going to improve access. As a treatment reminder,

128
0:13:27,840 --> 0:13:32,720
it's really critical that you get this in during the first seven to 10 days was another study

129
0:13:33,360 --> 0:13:37,440
out there where really if you give if you give monoclonal's late, if you wait till someone's

130
0:13:37,440 --> 0:13:43,040
already, you know, in the ICU till it's late in that second week, if you miss that front window,

131
0:13:43,760 --> 0:13:49,200
you don't do anyone any help. We've been actually infusing a lot of people through the united

132
0:13:49,200 --> 0:13:55,840
in research study. And this has been great to give people access to monoclonal therapy in the

133
0:13:55,840 --> 0:14:01,600
comfort of their own home through infusions. We get into our early inflammatory phase,

134
0:14:01,600 --> 0:14:06,800
and maybe just as a reminder, still remdesivir still being used in hospitalized patients with

135
0:14:06,800 --> 0:14:14,960
oxygen saturations less than 94%. A little broader with regard to not limiting it based upon renal

136
0:14:14,960 --> 0:14:23,680
function steroids. Again, second week oxygen saturations less than 94. We discussed last time

137
0:14:23,680 --> 0:14:32,800
updated data on anticoagulation. A number of studies that were showing that in ICU, critically ill

138
0:14:32,800 --> 0:14:38,000
patients that prophylactic dosing anticoagulation was associated with the best outcomes. But in

139
0:14:38,000 --> 0:14:44,640
your moderately ill floor patients, that full dose anticoagulation was associated with the best outcomes.

140
0:14:44,640 --> 0:14:51,280
But some exciting new news on tocelism map. I've been waiting for this for quite a while,

141
0:14:51,280 --> 0:14:59,200
actually. And this is the recovery data. So just put on a preprint tocelism map in patients admitted

142
0:14:59,200 --> 0:15:06,240
to hospital with COVID-19 recovery trial, preliminary results of a randomized controlled open label

143
0:15:06,240 --> 0:15:12,400
platform trial. This is a preprint. But I got a chance to look through this. This study looked

144
0:15:12,400 --> 0:15:20,960
at over 4000 adults, and the patients were allocated to receive tocelism map either as a single dose

145
0:15:20,960 --> 0:15:26,320
or a second dose. And actually, there's a weight based adjustment. So as high as 800 milligrams,

146
0:15:27,040 --> 0:15:32,240
or down to 400 milligrams based upon various weights, you can look up and, you know,

147
0:15:32,240 --> 0:15:37,040
find the dose for your patient. But a lot of times you'll use this flat 400. This was an adjusted,

148
0:15:37,040 --> 0:15:42,560
just like in REM cap, patients allocated to tocelism map were more likely to be discharged from the

149
0:15:42,560 --> 0:15:51,760
patient from the hospital alive within 28 days. So 54% versus 47% with a rate ratio of 1.23 p-value

150
0:15:51,760 --> 0:16:02,480
of 0.0001. Among those not receiving invasive mechanical ventilation, less likely to end up

151
0:16:02,480 --> 0:16:12,320
on a mechanical ventilator or die. So 33 versus 38. And again, p-value of 0.0005. So let me translate

152
0:16:12,320 --> 0:16:19,120
this. These patients had a background of steroids. And if tosy was given with a background of steroids,

153
0:16:19,120 --> 0:16:28,880
there was a 14% reduction in 28 day mortality with a p-value of less than 0.007. And almost a 20%

154
0:16:28,880 --> 0:16:36,320
reduction in the risk of requiring intubation with a p-value of 0.01. So this builds on the REM cap data,

155
0:16:36,320 --> 0:16:43,520
starting to get a sense of when and in what context and how to use tosy in a manner that is

156
0:16:43,520 --> 0:16:51,440
associated with, I think, really clear, well-designed trial data supporting a mortality benefit as

157
0:16:51,440 --> 0:16:57,040
well as a better outcome, not ending up on a mechanical ventilator. Secondary infection phase,

158
0:16:58,000 --> 0:17:03,440
you know, I always tell people remember your fungal and your bacterial infections. This is a later

159
0:17:03,440 --> 0:17:08,400
part of the disease. Most people coming in are not infected, but there was another nice article

160
0:17:08,400 --> 0:17:15,600
in open form infectious disease, bacterial super infections among persons with coronavirus disease

161
0:17:15,600 --> 0:17:21,520
2019, a comprehensive review of data from postmortem studies. So these are people who ended up

162
0:17:21,520 --> 0:17:26,000
dying, right? So it's not just looking at everyone, it's looking at the people that actually died

163
0:17:26,000 --> 0:17:31,920
from COVID-19. And I think interesting here is which pathogens did you see people die from? So

164
0:17:31,920 --> 0:17:39,360
asinidobacter balmani, staphylococcus aureus, right? I think we've talked about that before,

165
0:17:40,080 --> 0:17:47,440
pseudomonas aruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. So long super infections were the causes of death

166
0:17:47,440 --> 0:17:55,200
in about 16%. And so we're seeing these infections, but remember, we're also seeing some fungal

167
0:17:55,200 --> 0:18:00,880
infections, seeing a few cryptococcal infections, just sort of to remember it's not just aspergillus

168
0:18:00,880 --> 0:18:05,840
and candidemia. I also want to put a plug in here for TWIP. After we record this, we're going to

169
0:18:05,840 --> 0:18:11,840
record TWIP. And we're going to have our mystery case. And I don't want to give away the answer,

170
0:18:11,840 --> 0:18:19,440
but I may say that this may be a situation where Ivermectin saves the day. So just a teaser,

171
0:18:19,440 --> 0:18:26,160
listen to this week in parasitism. Okay, the multi-system inflammatory phase. This is a

172
0:18:26,160 --> 0:18:29,600
reminder, and we keep seeing this a couple of times today, people are being clapped out of the

173
0:18:29,600 --> 0:18:36,240
hospital. This is a bi-modal disease. People come in during that early inflammatory phase.

174
0:18:36,240 --> 0:18:41,280
We treat them, they're often doing better. But remember, 10 to 15% of those folks are either

175
0:18:41,280 --> 0:18:46,640
going to die in the next 30 days or get readmitted. So a lot of times they get better. And then they

176
0:18:46,640 --> 0:18:53,520
have this second late inflammatory, this multi-system inflammatory phase. And so don't just clap them

177
0:18:53,520 --> 0:18:58,800
out, make sure they have good close follow up, and make sure you're ready to jump in at that

178
0:18:58,800 --> 0:19:06,720
point as well. The tail phase, this sort of actually overlaps the post hospital plan. So we want to be

179
0:19:06,720 --> 0:19:11,760
thinking about what the appropriate anti-quagulation recommendations will be. And actually, we're

180
0:19:11,760 --> 0:19:16,800
going to meet at Ash and try to come up with some evidence-based guidance there based upon what

181
0:19:16,800 --> 0:19:21,600
people are doing, what the studies are. But I also want to talk a little bit about treatment

182
0:19:21,600 --> 0:19:27,040
here. I still find it frustrating. I'm sure a lot of our listeners who have long COVID

183
0:19:27,040 --> 0:19:33,440
find it frustrating that we still don't have a lot of really good data-driven interventions

184
0:19:33,440 --> 0:19:39,360
to help with long COVID. We take care of a lot of COVID patients, long COVID patients here in

185
0:19:39,360 --> 0:19:43,840
New York at Pro Health. But we're trying to consolidate our COVID care, actually. So we can

186
0:19:43,840 --> 0:19:49,280
really learn from each other, learn from patients. So I think one of the big things I just want to

187
0:19:49,280 --> 0:19:55,280
throw in here before we close is that people who have long COVID, who are having problems

188
0:19:55,280 --> 0:20:00,240
exercising, have problems going upstairs. There's a subset that has a significant

189
0:20:00,240 --> 0:20:05,120
post-exertional malaise issue. These aren't people who can just buck up and gradually

190
0:20:05,120 --> 0:20:11,040
increase their exercise. These are people who need to be treated differently. So you really

191
0:20:11,040 --> 0:20:15,680
want to screen for that in your guidance of what these people are going to be doing.

192
0:20:16,560 --> 0:20:20,880
So let me close with our fundraiser before we hit emails. And I want to say thank you,

193
0:20:20,880 --> 0:20:26,080
everyone, who's already gone to parasiteswithoutborders.com and started to contribute. Because

194
0:20:26,080 --> 0:20:32,400
through the months of February and March, donations made to parasites without borders will be matched

195
0:20:32,400 --> 0:20:38,480
and doubled by TWB and donated to the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene,

196
0:20:38,480 --> 0:20:43,600
including scholarships for their annual meeting travel awards. And I'm going to focus on that.

197
0:20:43,600 --> 0:20:53,920
We are going to try to raise money and bring women, early career women, from low-income parts of the

198
0:20:53,920 --> 0:21:00,960
world to the annual American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene meeting, really help them

199
0:21:00,960 --> 0:21:07,840
invest in these young women. And hopefully, instead of 15% of the leadership in so much of

200
0:21:07,840 --> 0:21:12,880
science being old white men, we can actually increase the diversity and the opportunity.

201
0:21:12,880 --> 0:21:18,320
So help us do that, help us make a difference. Our first email is from Dagfin, who's writing from

202
0:21:18,320 --> 0:21:25,200
Oslo, Norway, where it's minus nine Celsius. A question regarding a group of patients frequently

203
0:21:25,200 --> 0:21:32,960
overlooked drug-addicted patients who Dagfin works with, according to their national service,

204
0:21:32,960 --> 0:21:39,280
they are a Norway for not a single case among these patients have been reported. And he sees

205
0:21:39,280 --> 0:21:43,920
similar reports from other countries. Do you have any idea why this group of patients who are

206
0:21:43,920 --> 0:21:48,960
usually very susceptible to infection seems to be nearly unaffected by SARS-CoV-2 virus?

207
0:21:48,960 --> 0:21:55,600
Yeah, I have to say that that is an interesting observation. And though I haven't seen a lot of

208
0:21:55,600 --> 0:22:01,760
data here, that actually goes along with my experience. We, as infectious disease physicians,

209
0:22:01,760 --> 0:22:08,400
interact with and take care of a lot of intravenous drug users, develop a lot of

210
0:22:08,400 --> 0:22:13,840
bloodstream infections, endocarditis, things like that. Unfortunately, what we have seen in the

211
0:22:13,840 --> 0:22:19,680
United States is a significant increase in the amount of drug abuse deaths due to drug-associated

212
0:22:19,680 --> 0:22:25,360
overdoses. But no, my experience has actually been in Lises. We are not seeing a lot of those

213
0:22:25,360 --> 0:22:30,960
individuals. I don't know if it's a younger demographic. You would think that their comorbidities and

214
0:22:30,960 --> 0:22:36,000
the other problems would put them at higher risk for COVID. But no, that actually is in line and

215
0:22:36,000 --> 0:22:41,120
very interesting observation. Laura writes, are there any data about different vaccines ability

216
0:22:41,120 --> 0:22:47,600
to prevent long COVID? Laura is in vaccine priority group two, seems likely by the time she's vaccinated,

217
0:22:47,600 --> 0:22:52,240
multiple vaccines will be given to you ways. The messaging I've heard in the news is if you're

218
0:22:52,240 --> 0:22:56,720
offered a vaccine, take it. However, I'm fortunate to be in a demographic where hospitalization and

219
0:22:56,720 --> 0:23:02,960
death are extremely unlikely. So my primary concern has been long COVID as a healthy 40-year-old woman

220
0:23:02,960 --> 0:23:07,600
with autoimmune disease. Since studies have shown that even a relatively mild case of COVID can lead

221
0:23:07,600 --> 0:23:11,680
to long COVID, it seems to me I would want to choose the vaccine that has the highest

222
0:23:12,240 --> 0:23:17,440
efficacy of preventing disease of any severity. Yeah, no, that's an excellent point, right? And

223
0:23:17,440 --> 0:23:21,840
I think you could sort of do the math on this. You would say, okay, so let's take the mRNA vaccines,

224
0:23:21,840 --> 0:23:29,280
95% reduction in symptomatic disease. We're not really seeing long COVID in people who suddenly

225
0:23:29,280 --> 0:23:33,280
develop symptoms and then find out through serology they were asymptomatically infected.

226
0:23:34,400 --> 0:23:40,160
Clearly, the majority, if not all, of people who developed long COVID had some degree of

227
0:23:40,160 --> 0:23:44,640
symptomatic COVID. It isn't necessarily that you need to be severe enough to be in the hospital,

228
0:23:44,640 --> 0:23:50,000
so preventing severe disease is not necessarily enough. Preventing symptomatic disease seems to be

229
0:23:50,000 --> 0:23:55,520
something we want to do. We are hoping that people who've been vaccinated are less likely to develop

230
0:23:55,520 --> 0:23:59,840
long COVID. And I was actually speaking to one of my colleagues today for Tima Johari,

231
0:23:59,840 --> 0:24:04,880
people who have gotten even a single dose of vaccine when they get COVID, this unfortunately

232
0:24:04,880 --> 0:24:09,840
has happened, they tended to quite well. So I'm very optimistic that the vaccines across the

233
0:24:09,840 --> 0:24:13,920
board are going to reduce the risk of long COVID. At this point, we don't know, and we're still

234
0:24:13,920 --> 0:24:17,760
going to keep an eye on this. Millions of people are being vaccinated, but I see your point,

235
0:24:17,760 --> 0:24:24,640
the J&J, what if we say, oh, it's less effective at preventing mild disease? Are those people with

236
0:24:24,640 --> 0:24:29,680
mild disease who got a JJ vaccine? Are they going to be at a significant risk of going on

237
0:24:29,680 --> 0:24:34,960
to long COVID? We certainly don't know. But that I think is an important thing for us to keep an eye

238
0:24:34,960 --> 0:24:40,160
on. Aviva wants to know about Passover coming up in a month and a half. They will have

239
0:24:41,680 --> 0:24:45,600
six adults and three kids. The adults will all be vaccinated, the kids not,

240
0:24:46,800 --> 0:24:51,040
and they want to know, is it safe? We can test the kids, we can keep them home from school,

241
0:24:51,040 --> 0:24:56,800
we can test them again. There's a debate in this family as to whether this is safe to do. We value

242
0:24:56,800 --> 0:25:03,040
your input. Okay, no, I mean, I am going to have the same situation. I don't know if people notice

243
0:25:03,040 --> 0:25:10,480
or know this, but I will be celebrating Passover. The current plan is my dad's birthday

244
0:25:10,480 --> 0:25:16,960
corresponds with the first Sator, the first night. And so our plan, my mother, is going to be fully

245
0:25:16,960 --> 0:25:23,040
vaccinated. My father will be fully vaccinated. I will be fully vaccinated. And then my wife,

246
0:25:23,040 --> 0:25:28,880
myself and our children. So that's going to be seven of us together. You know, I will recommend

247
0:25:28,880 --> 0:25:34,640
that everyone gets tested. Preferably, you know, the morning, right, it's going to be a Saturday

248
0:25:34,640 --> 0:25:39,680
is the first night, I believe. Hopefully I got that right. You know, everyone gets tested before.

249
0:25:40,720 --> 0:25:45,840
My parents, I actually say, hey, they've been vaccinated. I'm not particularly worried about

250
0:25:45,840 --> 0:25:50,800
them. It's more the risk, you know, my wife is not going to be vaccinated by them. My children

251
0:25:50,800 --> 0:25:55,360
will not be vaccinated by then. I think this is one of the things once people have been vaccinated,

252
0:25:55,360 --> 0:25:59,680
you don't want to undersell and say you can't change things. I actually think that a year ago,

253
0:25:59,680 --> 0:26:05,280
when my parents were not vaccinated, we did not have Passover with them. This year with them

254
0:26:05,280 --> 0:26:10,320
being vaccinated, I actually think we're going to go ahead. And I think that that is a reasonable

255
0:26:10,320 --> 0:26:16,640
risk, but nothing's 100% safe. So you want to consider all this. If my wife, for instance, had

256
0:26:16,640 --> 0:26:21,840
health issues, she had, you know, problems with her immune system, I might rethink that. So you

257
0:26:21,840 --> 0:26:26,800
want to you want to make this an individual decision for everyone. One more from Eugene in Atlanta.

258
0:26:27,360 --> 0:26:33,040
What are your thoughts on getting mRNA vaccine people being immunosuppressed with diseases such

259
0:26:33,040 --> 0:26:37,920
as crone and treated with drugs like stelara? I would imagine not to miss the opportunity of

260
0:26:37,920 --> 0:26:43,360
getting the vaccine, then perhaps resuming the drugs sometime after the second vaccine dose.

261
0:26:43,360 --> 0:26:48,800
Yeah, that is routinely what we're doing. We're still recommending the vaccination. We're not sure

262
0:26:48,800 --> 0:26:54,800
that it will be as effective in these individuals as it would be in someone who has an intact immune

263
0:26:54,800 --> 0:26:59,360
system who's not an immunosuppressant. And this might actually be the population of

264
0:27:00,400 --> 0:27:05,840
communicating with one of the oncologists today, patients who are on certain drugs that interfere

265
0:27:05,840 --> 0:27:11,200
with B cell and other immune function. This might be a situation we actually do do one of these

266
0:27:11,200 --> 0:27:17,280
semi quantitative anti spike serology tests. But no, we're recommending that people get

267
0:27:17,280 --> 0:27:21,520
vaccinated. We're just a little concerned. They may not get as robust a protection.

268
0:27:21,520 --> 0:27:27,360
That's COVID-19 clinical update number 49 with Dr. Daniel Griffin. Thank you, Daniel.

269
0:27:27,360 --> 0:27:36,400
Oh, thank you so much. And everyone be safe. It's so close to the spring. We're going to make it.
