0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:06,960
This week in virology, the podcast about viruses, the kind that make you sick.

2
0:00:10,400 --> 0:00:20,720
From Microbe TV, this is Twiv, this week in virology, episode 755, recorded on May 13, 2021.

3
0:00:21,440 --> 0:00:27,920
I'm Vincent Rackeniello, and you're listening to the podcast All About Viruses. Joining me today

4
0:00:27,920 --> 0:00:34,720
from New York, Daniel Griffin. Hello, everyone. How's it going this week, Daniel?

5
0:00:36,560 --> 0:00:42,800
It's mixed, right? Numbers are getting better in New York, right? We finally, the other day,

6
0:00:42,800 --> 0:00:49,840
got below less than 2,000 people in hospital, which is quite, you know, imagine, at one point,

7
0:00:49,840 --> 0:00:54,720
we had more than that dying per day, right? Now we're less than 2,000 in hospital.

8
0:00:54,720 --> 0:01:01,360
So it's amazing the way our benchmark is changing. We're still seeing 20, 30, 40 people dying a day,

9
0:01:01,360 --> 0:01:08,800
but that's not 2,000. Still had another one of my patients die last night, so we're still losing

10
0:01:08,800 --> 0:01:13,680
people. Still, I mean, people die of COVID here. But I think people are seeing there's a change.

11
0:01:13,680 --> 0:01:18,560
I mean, a lot of the hospitals are pointing out 99% of the people that are getting admitted

12
0:01:18,560 --> 0:01:24,080
now are people that never got a vaccine. So that's what we're seeing. We're seeing people who would

13
0:01:24,080 --> 0:01:30,640
rather take their chances not do well, right? This is the lottery that you lose. But let me start

14
0:01:30,640 --> 0:01:35,440
off with our quotation, and then we'll go right into this. And I'm going to start with a quotation

15
0:01:35,440 --> 0:01:43,520
from Nelson Mandela. There is no keener revelation of a society's soul than the way it treats its

16
0:01:43,520 --> 0:01:48,480
children. So we're going to be talking actually quite a bit about children today. There's been a

17
0:01:48,480 --> 0:01:55,200
lot of news about kids and masks. We'll try to hit on everything. And a lot of stuff is hot off the

18
0:01:55,200 --> 0:02:01,840
press, right? So I was listening, I was listening to the latest Twiv right before this. I do listen

19
0:02:01,840 --> 0:02:08,000
to all the other Twiv and Twix episodes, by the way. So there's some comment. If Daniel's listening,

20
0:02:08,000 --> 0:02:15,680
I'm always listening, right? Like Dauchy on the couch or something. But let's start off with,

21
0:02:15,680 --> 0:02:19,840
we won't get right to the hot news. We'll start with some background on May 6th,

22
0:02:19,840 --> 0:02:26,960
Moderna reported. Phase two, three teen cove study of mRNA 1273 and adolescents.

23
0:02:27,680 --> 0:02:35,200
The phase two, three study of mRNA 1273 and adolescents ages 12 to 17 completed enrollment

24
0:02:35,200 --> 0:02:44,320
in the US. We got initial analysis here of 3235 participants, randomized two to one. And we're

25
0:02:44,320 --> 0:02:52,720
seeing here vaccine efficacy of 96% in the zero negative participants who received at least one

26
0:02:52,720 --> 0:02:59,920
injection, right? So the analysis included 12 cases starting 14 days after the first dose

27
0:02:59,920 --> 0:03:08,160
and based on the CDC definition of COVID-19, which requires one COVID-19 symptom paired with a

28
0:03:08,160 --> 0:03:16,320
nasopharyngeal swab or saliva sample positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. So just a little bit

29
0:03:16,320 --> 0:03:21,680
more about this, right? Just to give this is the Moderna sort of balance to the data that

30
0:03:22,320 --> 0:03:26,160
we're going to talk about with Pfizer, so we're going to talk about what Pfizer is now doing.

31
0:03:26,720 --> 0:03:33,680
But in the study, the median duration for follow-up in this analysis was 35 days following the second

32
0:03:33,680 --> 0:03:40,560
dose. The vaccine, the Moderna vaccine was very well tolerated in these adolescents.

33
0:03:41,360 --> 0:03:49,280
Majority of the, say, adverse events were mild, moderate, no serious safety concerns. So what

34
0:03:49,280 --> 0:03:54,640
are these things? Some side pain, right? It hurts to get poked with a needle. People did reconfirm

35
0:03:54,640 --> 0:04:05,040
that. Fire is hot. They did also report headache, fatigue, muscle pain. There was some chills. So

36
0:04:05,040 --> 0:04:08,320
the company reported that they're going to continue to collect the data here.

37
0:04:09,600 --> 0:04:16,640
We can look forward to the Moderna vaccine in the future, also requesting expansion down

38
0:04:16,640 --> 0:04:20,960
to cover adolescents if the rest of the data is in line with what we're seeing here.

39
0:04:20,960 --> 0:04:29,200
What about kids younger? What about down to six months? There's also the kid cove study

40
0:04:29,920 --> 0:04:36,000
of the Moderna vaccine in younger children. This is ongoing, and this actually is down to

41
0:04:36,000 --> 0:04:41,280
six months of age. So this will cover those six months of age up to 11 years. That's ongoing.

42
0:04:42,240 --> 0:04:46,480
Just to predict the future, you know, and this probably will not be Moderna first. It'll be

43
0:04:46,480 --> 0:04:52,400
Pfizer, Moderna, et cetera. We're thinking we're not going to be expanding down to these younger

44
0:04:52,400 --> 0:04:57,920
ages until probably September. But we'll see as we go forward with that.

45
0:04:57,920 --> 0:05:04,160
Daniel, can I ask you? The numbers are very small. And we puzzled about that on Twiv.

46
0:05:05,280 --> 0:05:07,360
Why are they so low for the adolescent studies?

47
0:05:08,320 --> 0:05:14,080
Yeah. You know, there's a couple ways to look at this. One is we're just sort of slightly moving

48
0:05:14,080 --> 0:05:19,360
moving the bar here. So normally we think of vaccine studies as being about 30,000 people,

49
0:05:19,360 --> 0:05:27,520
minimum duration of two months. And so we've had now millions of people 16, 17, 18, just right

50
0:05:27,520 --> 0:05:32,160
above here. So you're just sort of moving that down a little bit. And you're basically saying,

51
0:05:32,160 --> 0:05:37,040
is there any sort of a different signal here? So this really builds on the 30 thought. You

52
0:05:37,040 --> 0:05:43,120
couldn't do this by itself. You couldn't say, oh, I'm just going to do a, in this case, 3,235

53
0:05:43,120 --> 0:05:49,120
participant study and get a vaccine licensed based on that. So it's really, this is data building

54
0:05:49,120 --> 0:05:53,040
on the other data. And actually, no, that's, I'm glad you bring up because I get this question

55
0:05:53,040 --> 0:05:58,240
all the time, parents say, like, but it's only like 3000 here, 2000 here, while I talk about 5,000

56
0:05:58,240 --> 0:06:03,120
people in these studies so far. We're actually talking about millions of people. And we're just

57
0:06:03,120 --> 0:06:08,240
moving moving that bar a little bit. You know, what is physiologically the difference between a 16

58
0:06:08,240 --> 0:06:13,600
year old and a 15 year old, probably, as we're seeing not not very much, except boy,

59
0:06:14,160 --> 0:06:18,640
this looks like an age when we get a really robust immune response. Is that good, Benson?

60
0:06:19,600 --> 0:06:24,560
Try to see if there's more questions. Yeah, so I mean, you say millions, but the trial was,

61
0:06:24,560 --> 0:06:30,720
you know, tens of thousands. So are we, are we following people who are being vaccinated in some

62
0:06:30,720 --> 0:06:36,400
way? Yeah, so there's, there's two main ways that we're following people who've been vaccinated,

63
0:06:36,400 --> 0:06:43,280
right? And I think Pfizer actually is the vaccine that has the most doses out there. Well, over 100

64
0:06:43,280 --> 0:06:48,720
million here in the US alone. And there's two ways we follow that. So one is the VAERS, which is

65
0:06:48,720 --> 0:06:56,000
sort of a passive anyone can report. But there's also active, we call phase four, where we continue

66
0:06:56,000 --> 0:07:01,680
to follow a large cohort of these people who've been vaccinated. So it's a combination. The VAERS

67
0:07:01,680 --> 0:07:07,360
is the broadest, right? And as we saw, even something as rare as with the clotting with JJ,

68
0:07:07,360 --> 0:07:13,680
something that, you know, is maybe one in a million or so, maybe one in 100,000, we can pick that up.

69
0:07:13,680 --> 0:07:19,520
So we have actually a tremendous amount of safety data in, you know, in the age group just right

70
0:07:19,520 --> 0:07:26,720
above 15. So 16, 17, 18. Okay, great. Thank you. Transmission. You know, as I like to say,

71
0:07:26,720 --> 0:07:33,840
COVID-19, most commonly spreads during close contact. COVID-19 can sometimes be spread by

72
0:07:33,840 --> 0:07:42,080
airborne transmission. People seem very excited that that's been added. CD COVID-19 spreads less

73
0:07:42,080 --> 0:07:48,080
commonly through contact with contaminated surfaces, right? And that was where it said maybe one in

74
0:07:48,080 --> 0:07:55,040
every 10,000 case is due to contact. So we've really moved a lot away from the hygiene theater.

75
0:07:55,040 --> 0:08:03,600
So this last week, I have to say the whole outdoor transmission topic heated up. This is a moving

76
0:08:03,600 --> 0:08:09,840
target. And many are actually taking issue. I'm going to say appropriately. So with this number

77
0:08:09,840 --> 0:08:19,120
that's being bandied about of less than 10%. Now, now, I for a while have quoted that your risk

78
0:08:19,120 --> 0:08:26,640
of getting COVID outdoors versus indoor is about 20 times less likely outdoors, right? So when

79
0:08:26,640 --> 0:08:33,920
that put us more down around less than 5%. Now, I want to say there isn't necessarily new science

80
0:08:33,920 --> 0:08:40,480
here that everyone's getting sort of excited about. It's really rather a reaction to the updated CDC

81
0:08:40,480 --> 0:08:47,680
camp guidance where masking outdoors is recommended as a baseline with certain exceptions. And we

82
0:08:47,680 --> 0:08:55,120
talked about this CDC guidance that was updated by the CDC on April 24th. And what did they say?

83
0:08:55,120 --> 0:09:02,000
What got sort of a strong reaction is they said all people in camp facilities should wear masks

84
0:09:02,000 --> 0:09:08,320
at all times with exceptions. All right. So what are those exceptions? And we talked about this.

85
0:09:08,320 --> 0:09:13,120
It could be the exceptions could be certain people or certain settings or activities.

86
0:09:13,120 --> 0:09:19,680
Certain people, they said, children to and younger, a person with a disability who cannot safely

87
0:09:19,680 --> 0:09:25,440
wear or remove a mask if necessary. Anyone who has trouble breathing is unconscious, right? So we're

88
0:09:25,440 --> 0:09:31,440
we're saying certain people are exempted from this, but also certain settings and activities,

89
0:09:31,440 --> 0:09:38,400
right? And so what are those? Eating, drinking, swimming, napping involved in activities that

90
0:09:38,400 --> 0:09:44,320
could make your mask wet during high intensity activities where a mask would create difficulties

91
0:09:44,320 --> 0:09:50,560
breathing. And now add to this vaccinated, right? So that that's going to bring us back to outdoor

92
0:09:50,560 --> 0:09:58,240
transmission. But before we jump into that, breaking news, right here on Twiv. I don't know if you

93
0:09:58,240 --> 0:10:05,120
heard this, Vincent, but today, Dr. Wilensky at the CDC announced in Thursday the day that we're

94
0:10:05,120 --> 0:10:13,600
recording this episode that people fully vaccinated against COVID-19 do not need to wear masks or

95
0:10:13,600 --> 0:10:19,520
practice social distancing indoors or outdoors, except under certain circumstances.

96
0:10:20,400 --> 0:10:26,320
This was then echoed by Anthony Fauci. Now, there certainly are special considerations

97
0:10:26,320 --> 0:10:32,160
if a person cannot mount an effective immune response to the vaccine. I was meeting with a

98
0:10:32,160 --> 0:10:39,280
gentleman on Tuesday, 89 years old. He has an immunodeficiency where he has to get

99
0:10:39,280 --> 0:10:47,440
intravenous immunoglobulins on a regular basis. He has some ongoing viral issues. Yeah, that's

100
0:10:47,440 --> 0:10:53,040
not a man who's going to go to the ball game with his mask off or be in a large indoor setting

101
0:10:53,040 --> 0:11:00,800
with his mask off. So this is certainly great news for people that have a healthy immune system,

102
0:11:00,800 --> 0:11:08,400
people who can mount a proper response to the vaccines. I think that this is reasonable.

103
0:11:08,400 --> 0:11:14,960
I think it's responsible. I think the science is now here and clear on just how incredible

104
0:11:14,960 --> 0:11:19,440
protection a person gets when they're vaccinated. And I think this is going to challenge some of

105
0:11:19,440 --> 0:11:24,240
the comments and concerns about quote unquote herd immunity or community immunity.

106
0:11:24,240 --> 0:11:31,280
If you're vaccinated, right, we learn things that masks reduce risk by 80%. Maybe being outdoors

107
0:11:31,280 --> 0:11:39,200
reduces risk by 95%. Your risk of ending up in the hospital or dying of COVID is reduced even more

108
0:11:39,200 --> 0:11:44,960
most dramatically by vaccination. And I think that the science is now here. And I think as people,

109
0:11:44,960 --> 0:11:52,080
you know, beat up the CDC a little, the CDC gives us evidence-based, reliable guidance.

110
0:11:52,080 --> 0:11:57,840
And we've been thinking the science has been mounting. It's finally here and the CDC did not

111
0:11:57,840 --> 0:12:03,760
wait and they stepped forward and endorsed these recommendations. But let's get back to outdoor

112
0:12:03,760 --> 0:12:09,920
transmission. You know, as I said, this is not something new, but let's go through what the data

113
0:12:09,920 --> 0:12:17,440
is when we hear this less than 10%. So back in November, there was a systematic review

114
0:12:17,440 --> 0:12:23,760
published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases, outdoor transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and other

115
0:12:23,760 --> 0:12:30,480
respiratory viruses, a systematic review. So these authors conducted a systematic review

116
0:12:30,480 --> 0:12:36,640
of peer-reviewed papers indexed in PubMed, M-based and Web of Science, and freeprints

117
0:12:37,280 --> 0:12:44,880
in Europe PMC through 12 August 2020 that described cases of human transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

118
0:12:44,880 --> 0:12:49,520
Reports of other respiratory virus transmission were included for reference. Now,

119
0:12:50,080 --> 0:12:53,200
I think it's getting nice when I listen to the other twibs that were getting back to

120
0:12:53,200 --> 0:12:58,240
peer-reviewed literature. So hopefully in the future, all of these analysis will only include

121
0:12:58,240 --> 0:13:05,520
peer-reviewed, properly-fetted research. But the authors here reported that based on five

122
0:13:05,520 --> 0:13:12,640
identified studies, they found a low proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infections occurred outdoors. And

123
0:13:12,640 --> 0:13:20,400
they say less than 10%. And then here's where you get that number. The odds of indoor transmission

124
0:13:20,400 --> 0:13:27,360
were very high compared to outdoors 18.7 times, right? And they give a confidence interval to that.

125
0:13:27,360 --> 0:13:35,520
So that's that I say 20, and I'm rounding 18.7 up to 20. Now, I will say, though, if you don't

126
0:13:35,520 --> 0:13:40,960
just read the results, but if you actually go through this whole article, and this will be posted,

127
0:13:40,960 --> 0:13:45,760
I think on parasites without borders so that you can actually do this and start looking at the

128
0:13:45,760 --> 0:13:53,360
tables, you'll actually see there's two really large studies in this analysis. One that involved

129
0:13:53,360 --> 0:14:03,280
10,926 cases and another that involved 7,322. And in those two large studies, the number was

130
0:14:03,280 --> 0:14:10,400
actually less than 1%. So it is true that the risk is less than 10%, but based on the two

131
0:14:10,400 --> 0:14:16,720
large studies that were included, it was less than one. Now, there was a small study with 103

132
0:14:16,720 --> 0:14:25,520
work-related cases. In that study, they suggested maybe 5%. So I think it's important to look through

133
0:14:25,520 --> 0:14:32,400
the data here. Yes, it is less than 10%. It may actually be less than 1%. So if you're outdoors,

134
0:14:32,400 --> 0:14:40,480
you've probably reduced your risk by at least 95%. People get vaccinated as we're seeing really

135
0:14:40,480 --> 0:14:46,080
goes down even farther. And that's what we're hearing from the CDC. So effective is vaccination

136
0:14:46,640 --> 0:14:51,920
that it is even more effective than wearing a mask and being outdoors and protecting you.

137
0:14:52,640 --> 0:14:58,240
So I think the evidence is really compelling that being vaccinated and outdoors without masks

138
0:14:58,240 --> 0:15:04,160
is really low risk all around. And as the CDC is saying, boy, if you're vaccinated,

139
0:15:04,160 --> 0:15:10,560
maybe being indoors is fine too. Now that vaccine eligibility has dropped to age 12,

140
0:15:11,440 --> 0:15:16,240
this is really going to leave us a small donut hole for the summer going into this, right? The

141
0:15:16,240 --> 0:15:24,560
kids age three to 11, you combine testing, drops in community prevalence, all the many exceptions

142
0:15:24,560 --> 0:15:29,760
that are sort of built into when the masks can come off. I think we're really headed in a positive

143
0:15:29,760 --> 0:15:34,720
direction here testing. Never miss an opportunity to test. There's been a little discussion,

144
0:15:35,280 --> 0:15:39,600
and we're seeing it in our urgent care and primary care centers. People are embracing those tests

145
0:15:39,600 --> 0:15:44,640
at home. I wish the price point was better. I mean, it would be wonderful if there was some way of,

146
0:15:44,640 --> 0:15:50,640
you know, instead of these wide ranges that you're seeing, you know, if they were a dollar a test.

147
0:15:50,640 --> 0:15:56,160
They look like they're about 1250 a test. Some people are charging 35 a test. I guess if you buy

148
0:15:56,160 --> 0:16:02,240
them in bulk at 1000 at a time, you can get that, you know, lower price point. But we're actually

149
0:16:02,240 --> 0:16:07,120
getting, you know, parents are now doing this at home. Their child wakes up, doesn't feel well.

150
0:16:07,920 --> 0:16:14,880
They wake up, don't feel well. They do the test. Sometimes that test is positive. They come in for

151
0:16:14,880 --> 0:16:22,320
advice for guidance. So I just think the access to tests is fantastic. But boy, get vaccinated,

152
0:16:22,320 --> 0:16:28,160
and then you won't have to worry quite as much. All right, active vaccination. Never miss an

153
0:16:28,160 --> 0:16:34,160
opportunity to vaccinate. This is the big news that I think everyone's waiting for. This week was

154
0:16:34,160 --> 0:16:42,880
the FDA expansion of the EUA for Pfizer down to age 12. On Monday evening, May 10th, 6 p.m.

155
0:16:42,880 --> 0:16:48,480
The FDA announced that they had expanded the emergency use authorization for the Pfizer

156
0:16:48,480 --> 0:16:56,240
BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 COVID-19 caused by severe

157
0:16:56,240 --> 0:17:03,840
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus to SARS-CoV-2 to include adolescents 12 through 15 years of age.

158
0:17:04,880 --> 0:17:09,120
I was very happy about the timing because I was going to peer on TV. I did appear on TV the

159
0:17:09,120 --> 0:17:14,960
following morning at Tuesday AM, and I was going to discuss this expansion. So it was really good

160
0:17:14,960 --> 0:17:24,240
timing that they squeezed that in there for me. Now, what did the FDA have to say about this decision?

161
0:17:24,800 --> 0:17:33,760
And they actually said, so March 2020, March 1st, 2020 through April 30, 2021, approximately 1.5

162
0:17:33,760 --> 0:17:41,360
million COVID-19 cases in individuals 11 to 17 years of age had been reported to the Centers for

163
0:17:41,360 --> 0:17:48,320
Disease Control. The FDA has determined that Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine has met the

164
0:17:48,320 --> 0:17:55,680
statutory criteria to amend the EUA and that the known and potential benefits of this vaccine

165
0:17:55,680 --> 0:18:01,760
in individuals 12 years of age and older outweigh the known and potential risks supporting the

166
0:18:01,760 --> 0:18:08,960
vaccine's use in this population. So we discussed the data on a prior TWIV. We discussed some data

167
0:18:08,960 --> 0:18:14,320
today on Moderna, but in the past we discussed this study with over 2,000 participants. So the

168
0:18:14,320 --> 0:18:22,160
available safety data to support the EUA and adolescents down to 12 included 2,260 participants

169
0:18:22,160 --> 0:18:27,600
aged 12 through 15 enrolled in an ongoing, so it's ongoing to keep looking at these kids

170
0:18:27,600 --> 0:18:35,280
randomized placebo control clinical trial in the United States. Of these 1,131 adolescents

171
0:18:35,280 --> 0:18:40,960
who received the vaccine, they were followed for a minimum, right? It's got to do at least two

172
0:18:40,960 --> 0:18:47,600
months, which they did. And in this analysis among participants without evidence of prior

173
0:18:47,600 --> 0:18:55,280
infection with SARS-CoV-2, no cases of COVID-19 occurred, so 0, 100% protection.

174
0:18:55,280 --> 0:19:04,720
Now, on Wednesday, the ACIP voted unanimously. I don't know why I still get emotional about this,

175
0:19:04,720 --> 0:19:08,880
but I do. I mean, this was a huge, you know, actually brought a tear to my eye when I heard

176
0:19:08,880 --> 0:19:15,760
not only the votes coming in, but the comments afterwards. But the committee unanimously voted

177
0:19:15,760 --> 0:19:21,920
to recommend the Pfizer vaccine for adolescents 12 to 15, and there were really several important

178
0:19:21,920 --> 0:19:27,200
comments. And it was really interesting to hear some of the comments post-vote. Now,

179
0:19:27,200 --> 0:19:31,280
Aporva Mandavili at the New York Times did a really nice job of capturing the comments,

180
0:19:31,280 --> 0:19:34,720
which I appreciate it. I was driving while I was listening, and I was trying to decide,

181
0:19:34,720 --> 0:19:40,720
should I pull over and jot these things down? So, fortunately, they were actually put in print.

182
0:19:41,840 --> 0:19:46,880
Grace, Dr. Grace Lee, a member of the committee and professor of pediatrics at Stanford University

183
0:19:46,880 --> 0:19:53,840
commented that, sometimes we lose the importance of children and adolescents in the midst of pandemic.

184
0:19:53,840 --> 0:20:00,240
There's such a focus on older adults in particular. Dr. Maldonado reinforced that

185
0:20:00,240 --> 0:20:06,960
children may be at lower risk, but they are not at no risk. And she pointed out,

186
0:20:06,960 --> 0:20:11,920
while children's risk of severe illness is low, compared with that of adults,

187
0:20:11,920 --> 0:20:19,040
the coronavirus has infected more than 1.5 million children, sent more than 13,000 children

188
0:20:19,040 --> 0:20:24,800
to hospitals more than our hospitals for flu and an average year, according to the data collected

189
0:20:24,800 --> 0:20:31,680
by the CDC. There was a comment that it is currently, COVID-19, is currently one of the top 10 causes

190
0:20:31,680 --> 0:20:39,040
of death in children since the pandemic began. And remember, this is with full lockdown, with

191
0:20:39,040 --> 0:20:45,280
virtual schools, with in the last year, camps and all these other activities shut down.

192
0:20:46,000 --> 0:20:51,360
I think it's really important to remember that these numbers were what we observed with a rather

193
0:20:51,360 --> 0:20:56,960
draconian lockdown with school closures, virtual learning, masks, everything else, things that,

194
0:20:56,960 --> 0:21:00,880
I remember last February, some of our health experts saying, this will never happen in America.

195
0:21:00,880 --> 0:21:05,840
Well, it happened in America. And despite that, we still had this impact.

196
0:21:05,840 --> 0:21:10,960
Another little bit of good news. I think this is great news that we're going to be expanding

197
0:21:10,960 --> 0:21:16,560
this opportunity to get vaccinated down. I'll let everyone know, my 15-year-old son, Barnaby,

198
0:21:16,560 --> 0:21:22,160
is scheduled Friday evening. So when this drops, he'll already have had his first vaccines. I'll

199
0:21:22,160 --> 0:21:28,320
be able to give some updates, maybe we'll even post a picture if he's willing to check with my wife

200
0:21:28,320 --> 0:21:33,440
first. But we learned about temperature stability. That's always a challenge with a lot of these

201
0:21:33,440 --> 0:21:36,960
vaccines, particularly, right? We think about the Pfizer with these thermal shippers.

202
0:21:37,760 --> 0:21:42,240
And we heard from Pfizer that they actually have an updated formulation, which may allow six months

203
0:21:42,240 --> 0:21:46,720
in the fridge. Well, Moderna is always right there with them. And they recently announced

204
0:21:46,720 --> 0:21:52,400
ongoing development data related to the current formulation that could support a three-month

205
0:21:52,400 --> 0:21:59,440
refrigerated shelf life for the vaccine, and also alternative formats to facilitate easier

206
0:21:59,440 --> 0:22:04,960
distribution to doctors' offices and other smaller settings. And I think this is critical,

207
0:22:04,960 --> 0:22:10,240
and I've talked a little bit about this, is some people are happy to go to these sort of large

208
0:22:10,240 --> 0:22:17,680
vaccination sites, the state-run sites. That's where Barnaby's going. But a lot of people want to

209
0:22:17,680 --> 0:22:22,080
have that conversation with their physician, particularly a lot of parents want to have the

210
0:22:22,080 --> 0:22:25,840
conversation with the pediatrician. What they've done here in New York State, and I think it's

211
0:22:25,840 --> 0:22:31,280
really ingenious, is the Pfizer vaccines come with over 1,000 in this thermal shipper.

212
0:22:32,640 --> 0:22:39,040
Not every pediatrician office is ready to accept 1,000 vaccines, and all the commitments of getting

213
0:22:39,040 --> 0:22:43,760
them out. So there's sort of a cooperative that they've arranged, where several pediatrician groups

214
0:22:43,760 --> 0:22:49,200
can work together to each accept a certain number of the vaccines. They get popped in a fridge,

215
0:22:49,200 --> 0:22:53,280
you got five days, so basically, you're Monday through Friday to get those vaccines into arms.

216
0:22:53,280 --> 0:22:59,200
So there'll be a little bit of flexibility and thinking outside the box to get this done so that

217
0:22:59,200 --> 0:23:03,520
we get to that next level of people who want to have a conversation, want to ask questions.

218
0:23:03,520 --> 0:23:09,360
I'm going to move to the viral symptom phase, right? The time for monitoring and monoclonals.

219
0:23:10,160 --> 0:23:18,320
And we have some data on NSAIDs. So things like ibuprofen, napkin, and we have some reassuring data

220
0:23:18,320 --> 0:23:24,400
on the ability to safely use the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen,

221
0:23:24,400 --> 0:23:31,360
napkin, in COVID-19. And actually, I'd say this is huge. This may not seem huge, but

222
0:23:31,360 --> 0:23:37,360
when a person is suffering through that viral symptomatic phase of COVID, or even starting to

223
0:23:37,360 --> 0:23:43,600
move into the early inflammatory, it can be miserable. And it is amazing what an Aleve

224
0:23:43,600 --> 0:23:49,520
anaperson, a couple ibuprofen can do, particularly the evening when that person is trying to get

225
0:23:49,520 --> 0:23:55,040
some rest. So early on, people may remember, there was a little bit of concern as a letter sent.

226
0:23:55,760 --> 0:24:02,240
But this article in the Lancet Rheumatology, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use and

227
0:24:02,240 --> 0:24:10,960
outcomes of COVID-19 in the ISA-RIC clinical characterization protocol UK cohort, a matched

228
0:24:10,960 --> 0:24:18,800
prospective cohort study. And so the authors reported on the results of this prospective

229
0:24:18,800 --> 0:24:24,720
multicenter cohort study that included patients admitted to hospital with a confirmatory or highly

230
0:24:24,720 --> 0:24:32,240
suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection between January 17th and August 10th, 2020. The primary outcome

231
0:24:32,240 --> 0:24:38,160
was in hospital mortality. And secondary outcomes were disease severity at presentation, admission

232
0:24:38,160 --> 0:24:44,080
to critical care, receipt of invasive ventilation, receipt of non-invasive ventilatory support,

233
0:24:44,080 --> 0:24:48,080
use of supplementary oxygen, acute kidney injury. And now what did they find?

234
0:24:49,040 --> 0:24:57,600
So this was a pretty robust study. They enrolled 78,674 patients across 255 health care facilities

235
0:24:57,600 --> 0:25:05,520
in England, Scotland, and Wales where there be dragons. In this cohort, 4,211 patients were

236
0:25:05,520 --> 0:25:11,200
recorded as taking systemic incense before admission to hospital. And they report that the

237
0:25:11,200 --> 0:25:17,360
NSAID use was not associated with worse in hospital mortality, not associated with critical care

238
0:25:17,360 --> 0:25:22,400
admission, not associated with the requirement for invasive ventilation, requirement for non-invasive

239
0:25:22,400 --> 0:25:31,360
ventilation, requirement for oxygen, or kidney injury. So basically NSAID use is safe in COVID-19.

240
0:25:31,360 --> 0:25:36,800
Passive vaccination. It actually looks like we're moving closer to full approval or licensure

241
0:25:37,440 --> 0:25:43,440
here as the data is such that recently the FDA said that the data is currently so compelling

242
0:25:44,000 --> 0:25:49,360
that they no longer agree with conducting placebo controlled trials here in the United States.

243
0:25:50,160 --> 0:25:55,440
Basically, this is considered the standard of care and something that should be offered to

244
0:25:55,440 --> 0:26:02,720
patients. A little bit of a challenge for the intramuscular, subcutaneous, and other monoclonal

245
0:26:02,720 --> 0:26:08,000
antibody therapies that are trying to come to market, try to get their trials. We also have

246
0:26:08,880 --> 0:26:15,360
ongoing trials looking at using these agents to protect contacts and high risk individuals

247
0:26:15,360 --> 0:26:20,480
unable to produce their own antibodies. So things are moving with monoclonals. Actually,

248
0:26:20,480 --> 0:26:27,600
it was at the gym today wearing a mask. I don't know if I need to anymore. This was before Dr.

249
0:26:27,600 --> 0:26:32,640
Walensky made the pronouncement. We'll have to see when the rules change, but actually seeing

250
0:26:32,640 --> 0:26:39,040
an advertisement on the television. So pretty exciting stuff that the information is getting out

251
0:26:39,040 --> 0:26:44,400
there. We need to use these more. Now early inflammatory phase, if room air saturations are

252
0:26:44,400 --> 0:26:51,680
less than 94%. That's when we have data that steroids dexamethasone from the recovery trial,

253
0:26:51,680 --> 0:26:58,080
six milligrams once a day for 10 days improves outcomes and saves life. There are certain

254
0:26:58,080 --> 0:27:02,320
situations where people are actually using little higher doses a little bit longer.

255
0:27:03,200 --> 0:27:08,000
But here's where I want to throw in a little bit of caution here. People following the news about

256
0:27:08,000 --> 0:27:15,920
India have probably heard about the black fungus or what is more properly called rhino-cerebral

257
0:27:15,920 --> 0:27:24,240
mucor mycosis. And there was a nice case series published in the journal of laryngeology and

258
0:27:24,240 --> 0:27:32,800
otology. And this was post coronavirus disease mucor mycosis, a deadly addition to the pandemic

259
0:27:32,800 --> 0:27:38,480
spectrum. And I don't know if people are familiar with this. I actually have seen a number of cases

260
0:27:38,480 --> 0:27:43,840
of this in my career and actually a number of cases when I was spending time in India.

261
0:27:44,480 --> 0:27:53,600
Here the authors describe 23 cases and the association with diabetes overzealous use of steroids,

262
0:27:53,600 --> 0:28:00,320
use of broad spectrum antibiotics, I'll add to treat a viral disease, and perhaps unclean oxygen

263
0:28:00,320 --> 0:28:07,440
delivery devices. They have some great images in this article disturbing images. They're not

264
0:28:07,440 --> 0:28:13,280
the actual looking and seeing in the open mouth of a patient that black s car, which is the fungus

265
0:28:13,280 --> 0:28:18,880
eating away. But if you do, if you look inside the mouth, and I mentioned I spent some time in

266
0:28:18,880 --> 0:28:23,920
Tamil Nadu where I saw some cases in the Indian population of this where you look inside the mouth

267
0:28:23,920 --> 0:28:28,640
and on the roof of the mouth, there's this black s car where the fungus is basically eating away

268
0:28:28,640 --> 0:28:34,240
the person's face and oral cavity. It's truly horrific. And I've even seen where it progresses

269
0:28:34,240 --> 0:28:40,720
and eats away the eye. But this is really a caution. This is a viral disease. They do not need these

270
0:28:40,720 --> 0:28:46,800
broad spectrum antibiotics. This steroids has somewhat of a benefit, but you do not keep these

271
0:28:46,800 --> 0:28:52,160
patients on steroids for three weeks. You don't give steroids and let the glucosees go really high.

272
0:28:52,160 --> 0:28:58,480
So where we're seeing a lot of this in India, this is really, we'll say iatrogenic, which means

273
0:28:58,480 --> 0:29:04,720
we're causing this. So we need to be a little bit careful here, please. Remdesivir has some

274
0:29:04,720 --> 0:29:10,320
minor impact at huge expense, I like to say. Anticoagulation for hospitalized patients.

275
0:29:11,680 --> 0:29:18,000
The science strongly recommends against HCQ at this point. I apologize, but that's where we are.

276
0:29:18,000 --> 0:29:23,520
There was a paper published in Nature Communications, mortality outcomes with hydroxychloroquine

277
0:29:23,520 --> 0:29:29,120
and chloroquine in COVID-19 from an international collaborative meta-analysis of randomized trials.

278
0:29:29,920 --> 0:29:36,160
And here the authors presented a meta-analysis of ongoing completed or discontinued randomized

279
0:29:36,160 --> 0:29:41,520
control trials on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine treatment for any COVID-19 patients.

280
0:29:41,520 --> 0:29:49,200
They reported on all-cause mortality, and they looked at publications, preprints. They even

281
0:29:49,200 --> 0:29:55,040
reached out to the investigators to get more information if needed. Looking through 63 trials

282
0:29:55,040 --> 0:30:01,520
were potentially eligible for inclusion. They include 14 unpublished trials with 1,308 patients,

283
0:30:02,160 --> 0:30:10,480
14 publications, preprints with 9,011 patients. They included the recovery and the WHO solidarity

284
0:30:10,480 --> 0:30:19,520
trials, which included 4,716 and 1,853 patients. Basically, just to say, the combined odds ratio

285
0:30:19,520 --> 0:30:27,840
on all-cause mortality for hydroxychloroquine was 1.11 for chloroquine, 1.77. Basically,

286
0:30:27,840 --> 0:30:31,520
they were reporting that treatment with hydroxychloroquine was associated with

287
0:30:31,520 --> 0:30:37,520
increased mortality. So it looks like HCQ is associated with a 10% increase in mortality.

288
0:30:37,520 --> 0:30:45,440
I think we need to move past that. Oxygen and pulmonary support, antibiotics are not helpful for

289
0:30:45,440 --> 0:30:50,560
treating viral infections. And as I mentioned, the experience here can increase the risk of

290
0:30:50,560 --> 0:30:57,600
kidney failure, progression to dialysis, death, and increase the risk of opportunistic infections,

291
0:30:58,160 --> 0:31:03,360
which can harm or actually, in some cases, kill our patients. We mentioned last time some data,

292
0:31:03,360 --> 0:31:09,360
tosyllismab added to steroids can improve outcomes and have a mortality benefit. Consider this

293
0:31:09,360 --> 0:31:13,840
early in patients not reporting, not responding to steroids. It's not something you want to wait

294
0:31:13,840 --> 0:31:19,360
to do. And this is something which has now actually been added to the ID society guidelines.

295
0:31:19,360 --> 0:31:26,720
Tail phase long COVID post-COVID. So our listeners may have heard that Dr. John Brooks,

296
0:31:26,720 --> 0:31:32,880
the chief medical officer for the CDC is COVID-19 responses. Let it be known that there will be

297
0:31:32,880 --> 0:31:39,040
forthcoming guidance from the CDC on how healthcare providers can identify long COVID

298
0:31:39,040 --> 0:31:45,200
and manage long COVID. And there will likely be a specific ICD-10 code, a diagnosed code

299
0:31:45,200 --> 0:31:49,600
for long COVID. And I was asked for some input on the sky and said it really looks like they're

300
0:31:49,600 --> 0:31:55,760
doing a great job recognizing that not all patients have access to testing during the acute phase

301
0:31:55,760 --> 0:32:01,600
or test positive by serology when they come to medical attention. I expect that this guidance

302
0:32:01,600 --> 0:32:07,600
will likely focus on the multidisciplinary team approach that many of our centers are finding so

303
0:32:07,600 --> 0:32:13,360
critical for meeting the needs of these patients. I also think it's really nice that this is kind

304
0:32:13,360 --> 0:32:17,840
of a new model. They're reaching out to some of these support groups. They're trying to get input

305
0:32:17,840 --> 0:32:26,480
from patients. I know survivor core has been asked to basically input on this. So I really think that

306
0:32:26,480 --> 0:32:32,400
this is going to be incredibly helpful for sharing the knowledge serving as an educational resource

307
0:32:33,280 --> 0:32:37,920
for all the many clinicians who are really stepping up and helping take care of these patients.

308
0:32:37,920 --> 0:32:42,320
Now I will finish by mentioning our fundraiser. So if you're not driving,

309
0:32:42,320 --> 0:32:46,960
stop what you're doing. Go to parasiteswithoutporters.com and help us support

310
0:32:46,960 --> 0:32:51,680
Foundation International Medical Relief of Children. This is an organization with sites

311
0:32:51,680 --> 0:32:57,280
throughout the world and the patients they care for are struggling. The young volunteers who

312
0:32:57,280 --> 0:33:02,240
usually go out to these sites, the financial support that they usually have to do all this

313
0:33:02,240 --> 0:33:07,040
tremendous work. It's not there. And if you look at these places, they have a couple of sites in

314
0:33:07,040 --> 0:33:13,200
India. They have sites in Sub-Saharan Africa, sites in South America. They have sites in so many of

315
0:33:13,200 --> 0:33:19,920
these places that are being so hard hit with COVID. Please help us support them so that we can

316
0:33:19,920 --> 0:33:25,840
really go beyond our borders and help address these global issues. All right, time for some

317
0:33:25,840 --> 0:33:32,480
questions for Daniel. You can send yours to Daniel at microbe.tv. First is from Pete.

318
0:33:32,480 --> 0:33:37,440
I have just sent money to a friend in India for oxygen, $500 for a cylinder,

319
0:33:37,440 --> 0:33:44,080
$204 a fill that would probably help two people. I'm thinking monoclonal, monoclonals would be a

320
0:33:44,080 --> 0:33:50,720
better option. Any idea how much and how to get them there? Yeah, so these are challenges. That's

321
0:33:50,720 --> 0:33:56,960
amazing that that amount of money is being taken for cylinders and these other things. And really

322
0:33:56,960 --> 0:34:02,320
frustrating that there was not better preparation for what's going on in India right now. I was

323
0:34:02,320 --> 0:34:09,600
actually told by someone, I work with actually a lot of Indian clinicians and that Remdesivir,

324
0:34:09,600 --> 0:34:15,760
for instance, was negotiated. So at least Remdesivir is only about $15 or $20 a dose in India. So

325
0:34:15,760 --> 0:34:21,840
that's better than $3,000 for a course here in the United States. But access to the monoclonals

326
0:34:21,840 --> 0:34:26,480
is difficult. There actually is a bit of a black market where the monoclonals, I don't know how

327
0:34:26,480 --> 0:34:31,600
they're actually being initially procured, but they seem to be being sent over to India. So

328
0:34:32,560 --> 0:34:37,840
I'm not going to endorse the black market. But yeah, when you start looking at these price points,

329
0:34:37,840 --> 0:34:44,080
when someone's paying that amount of money for oxygen, then some of these other costs just

330
0:34:44,080 --> 0:34:49,440
don't seem quite as high. So if anything, I think this just highlights what a tragedy is going on

331
0:34:49,440 --> 0:34:54,000
over there. David writes, universities are starting to implement vaccine mandates for

332
0:34:54,000 --> 0:34:57,760
their students. Since a lot of students come from overseas, the question keeps coming up,

333
0:34:57,760 --> 0:35:03,360
what do we do about students vaccinated with non FDA approved vaccines, AstraZeneca,

334
0:35:03,360 --> 0:35:09,120
Cinevax button, Covax and et cetera, revaccinate them seems kind of extreme given the existing

335
0:35:09,120 --> 0:35:14,960
manufacturing shortages, except non FDA approved vaccines in the context of a mandate or just

336
0:35:14,960 --> 0:35:19,680
some of them. Is there formal guidance? Obviously, there has to be a line drawn somewhere, but I'm

337
0:35:19,680 --> 0:35:27,360
not sure who draws this line. Yeah, I've actually seen that the CDC is starting to put together a

338
0:35:27,360 --> 0:35:34,320
guidance here. And what they are saying basically is if it's us FDA approved vaccines, all right,

339
0:35:34,320 --> 0:35:40,000
that counts. But then you get into something like what about AstraZeneca. So that's the current

340
0:35:40,000 --> 0:35:45,600
guidance. The current guidance, if somebody has vaccines that are FDA approved, considers effective,

341
0:35:46,320 --> 0:35:53,360
then that can be considered as adequately fully vaccinated, the same criteria two weeks after

342
0:35:53,360 --> 0:35:59,040
the last shot in the series. But so far, the rules are if a person got vaccines that our FDA

343
0:35:59,040 --> 0:36:04,880
has not fully reviewed, has not fully endorsed or licensed or given an EUA, right, we're in the

344
0:36:04,880 --> 0:36:10,080
world of EUAs, then we actually have to go ahead and revaccinate. And I think this is tough because

345
0:36:10,080 --> 0:36:14,240
I'm going to say in the next sentence, we have an abundance of vaccines here in the United States,

346
0:36:14,240 --> 0:36:19,040
we have the capability to do that. That's a little bit of an embarrassment, right, when

347
0:36:19,040 --> 0:36:24,480
we're talking about places like India, where those vaccines would make a huge difference.

348
0:36:24,480 --> 0:36:30,000
And what is the cheapest way to keep someone from dying from COVID-19, it's to vaccinate them.

349
0:36:30,000 --> 0:36:35,920
Tiffany writes, I have a co-worker who has gout. She had a terrible flare up about a week after

350
0:36:35,920 --> 0:36:41,040
getting her first vaccination. Is there any chance these events are connected? Her doctor told her

351
0:36:41,040 --> 0:36:46,560
they probably are, but it seems weird to me. She found this article on podiatry today,

352
0:36:46,560 --> 0:36:49,760
connecting gout attacks to vaccinations. I was just wondering what you think,

353
0:36:49,760 --> 0:36:55,840
I don't want any more reasons for people not to get vaccinated if they aren't based on fact.

354
0:36:55,840 --> 0:37:01,440
Yeah, so it would not surprise me, right? We often, well, as an infectious disease doctor,

355
0:37:01,440 --> 0:37:08,240
we often see inflammatory triggers related to gout flares, right? And you can imagine how

356
0:37:08,240 --> 0:37:12,240
bad that gout flare would be if you actually had COVID. And I've certainly seen patients who

357
0:37:12,240 --> 0:37:16,640
come in with COVID. I've certainly seen patients that come in with pneumonia, urate tract infections.

358
0:37:17,360 --> 0:37:22,800
You know, the gout is something that is driven by an inflammatory process,

359
0:37:23,360 --> 0:37:27,760
and something like a vaccine potentially could trigger that. It very easily treated, right?

360
0:37:27,760 --> 0:37:33,040
You treat it with ibuprofen or a leaf or a cultucine, right? We have many, many therapeutics for this.

361
0:37:34,160 --> 0:37:38,880
And I think that we need to be honest, right? And this was something mentioned on the last

362
0:37:38,880 --> 0:37:43,120
twist with is people get vaccines, they might have joint pain, they might have muscle pain.

363
0:37:43,920 --> 0:37:48,080
It might be more than just that 24 hours. A colleague of mine actually had really bad

364
0:37:48,080 --> 0:37:53,920
vertigo world spinning for several days after a vaccine. So there can be side effects. Why are

365
0:37:53,920 --> 0:37:59,040
we recommending these products with these horrible side effects? It's because you know,

366
0:37:59,040 --> 0:38:03,840
what's really horrible? Getting COVID-19. What's really horrible is dying of COVID-19. What's

367
0:38:03,840 --> 0:38:09,440
really horrible is having a breathing to put down into your trachea because you've got COVID-19

368
0:38:09,440 --> 0:38:15,520
and didn't get vaccinated. So we always talk about the risk benefits, boy, the risk and harmful

369
0:38:15,520 --> 0:38:19,840
potentialities of not being vaccinated. That's why we're vaccinating everyone.

370
0:38:19,840 --> 0:38:24,320
Lindsey writes, is there any evidence that people with a previous history of autoimmune platelet

371
0:38:24,320 --> 0:38:30,800
disorders like immune or thrombotic thrombocytopenic perpera are at increased risk of CVST from an

372
0:38:30,800 --> 0:38:37,360
adenovirus-vectored SARS-CoV-2 vaccine? Or if given one of those vaccines, should someone with such

373
0:38:37,360 --> 0:38:42,000
a history be monitored for signs of CVST more closely than someone who didn't?

374
0:38:42,000 --> 0:38:46,080
Yeah, you know, that's a great question, right? Because we sort of had this knee-jerk reaction

375
0:38:46,080 --> 0:38:49,920
that, well, boy, if you've had a problem like that in the past, that, oh, you're someone who

376
0:38:49,920 --> 0:38:54,480
should be at higher risk, we would think what has been shocking, right? We continue to track this,

377
0:38:54,480 --> 0:39:01,840
right? We continue to see the rare CVST associated with JJ. I'm going to say that. I think there's

378
0:39:01,840 --> 0:39:06,880
a connection there. I think we're all comfortable saying that rare as it continues to be.

379
0:39:07,760 --> 0:39:12,320
But we are interesting enough not seeing this connection, not seeing it occur in people with

380
0:39:12,880 --> 0:39:17,040
prior disorders, as you've described, even though that would have been the population we would think

381
0:39:17,040 --> 0:39:22,880
about seeing it in. So no, this group is not at any higher risk. This continues to be incredibly

382
0:39:22,880 --> 0:39:29,280
rare because it is so rare. Any intervention we might do is more likely to do harm than just watch

383
0:39:29,280 --> 0:39:34,480
for waiting. All right, the last one, Daniel, we read on Twiv and we thought actually you should

384
0:39:34,480 --> 0:39:39,360
answer it because we didn't have an answer. This is from Haley, who is a 26-year-old healthy

385
0:39:39,360 --> 0:39:46,080
woman who got a Pfizer vaccine, both doses, got a lot of side effects, and many of them

386
0:39:46,080 --> 0:39:52,880
lasting a long time. She now has daily headaches, muscle and joint pain, can't exercise. Her doctors

387
0:39:52,880 --> 0:39:59,360
don't know what to do. She's regretting, having gotten the vaccine. She says, please help.

388
0:40:00,080 --> 0:40:05,360
Yeah, I mean, I think this echoes what I was saying before, is that for not everyone, is it just,

389
0:40:05,360 --> 0:40:10,080
oh, I felt bad for 24 hours, or I was sort of fortunate. I barely noticed that I was getting

390
0:40:10,080 --> 0:40:18,000
my vaccination. Some individuals, like is being described here, can have risk or joint pain.

391
0:40:18,000 --> 0:40:24,080
They can have muscle pain, and sometimes that can last for several weeks. We're usually recommending

392
0:40:24,080 --> 0:40:31,920
that people take non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines for these, and this tends to last weeks.

393
0:40:31,920 --> 0:40:37,680
We are not seeing so far, right, that this turns into anything long-term. I understand that the

394
0:40:37,680 --> 0:40:43,280
frustration and the regret here. But if you are having difficulty, I mean, that's why we set up a

395
0:40:43,280 --> 0:40:47,600
lot of these centers to try to help people. And as I think a lot of our listeners know,

396
0:40:47,600 --> 0:40:53,840
I'm always happy to answer questions and to potentially step in and help in a situation like

397
0:40:53,840 --> 0:40:59,360
this. So have your doctors reach out, and I'm happy to hopefully help guide you through this process.

398
0:40:59,360 --> 0:41:05,440
That's COVID-19 clinical update number 62 with Dr. Daniel Griffin. Thank you, Daniel.

399
0:41:05,440 --> 0:41:12,240
Oh, thank you so much. And everyone, be safe.
