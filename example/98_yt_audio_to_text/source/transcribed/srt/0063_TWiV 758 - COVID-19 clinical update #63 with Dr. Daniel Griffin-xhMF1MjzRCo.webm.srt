0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:06,880
This week in virology, the podcast about viruses, the kind that make you sick.

2
0:00:10,400 --> 0:00:22,880
From Microbe TV, this is Twiv, this week in virology, episode 758 recorded on May 20, 2021.

3
0:00:22,880 --> 0:00:28,320
I'm Vincent Rack in yellow, and you are listening to the podcast all about viruses.

4
0:00:28,320 --> 0:00:31,600
Joining me today from New York, Daniel Griffin.

5
0:00:32,800 --> 0:00:41,040
Hello, everyone. Daniel, this is clinical update number 63. How will we know when the pandemic's

6
0:00:41,040 --> 0:00:49,360
over, Daniel? That's a great question. When will it shift from being a pandemic to just,

7
0:00:49,360 --> 0:00:54,720
hey, there's still COVID-19 around and it's become less of a pandemic?

8
0:00:54,720 --> 0:00:59,360
And maybe, Vincent, maybe you're the person to answer that question, because what was the point

9
0:00:59,360 --> 0:01:05,120
when polio ceased to be a pandemic and started to be just something we were trying to get rid of?

10
0:01:06,080 --> 0:01:12,640
Now, polio was around before we had this word pandemic, so we never got the call in a pandemic.

11
0:01:12,640 --> 0:01:16,960
But Daniel, would you say we're still in the middle of an HIV AIDS pandemic?

12
0:01:18,160 --> 0:01:23,280
Yeah, and I try to make that point. I've been offered a couple of people have reached out and

13
0:01:23,280 --> 0:01:29,520
said, oh, would you like to write a book? And I am working on a book that Chuck Knersch connected

14
0:01:29,520 --> 0:01:36,320
me with about sort of what happened with the vaccines and what was the rollout like.

15
0:01:36,320 --> 0:01:40,960
But the whole idea about writing a book about, oh, we've survived the pandemic or I have no other

16
0:01:40,960 --> 0:01:46,080
people have written these books. And it reminded me of a movie, and it was surviving the pandemic,

17
0:01:46,080 --> 0:01:52,480
and it was about HIV. And I remember talking to my buddy, Joe McGowan, I was like, I don't understand.

18
0:01:52,480 --> 0:02:00,800
It's not over. There are over 30 million people infected with HIV. We see another 50,000 new

19
0:02:00,800 --> 0:02:05,520
infections every year in the US. We see, you know, half a million to a million people every year

20
0:02:05,520 --> 0:02:10,240
dying of HIV. Explain to me how we're not still in the midst of that pandemic.

21
0:02:10,240 --> 0:02:15,600
That's right. So yeah, Daniel, before you start, what's on your bow tie today?

22
0:02:16,480 --> 0:02:21,040
You know, it kind of looks like a coronavirus, doesn't it? Yeah, it's very nice with the

23
0:02:21,040 --> 0:02:28,400
little coronas there. So all right. Yeah, our listeners may not know this, but it was about

24
0:02:28,400 --> 0:02:34,400
every one of my bow ties is an infectious disease. And whenever I appear on Friday, it's always a

25
0:02:34,400 --> 0:02:41,120
sexually transmitted infectious disease. And when you take care of patients, do you wear these

26
0:02:41,120 --> 0:02:49,760
infectious bow ties? I do, I do. Very good. And I started doing it in part as a teaching thing

27
0:02:49,760 --> 0:02:55,840
for the residents and medical students. So that was always, I actually, my socks match. I won't

28
0:02:55,840 --> 0:03:00,720
show those now, but they match the pathogen. So maybe I'm wearing like one with little red

29
0:03:00,720 --> 0:03:05,280
snappers. So there's supposed to cue them that it's tuberculosis. I have an anthrax. I have

30
0:03:05,920 --> 0:03:07,520
several others. Great. Love it.

31
0:03:09,200 --> 0:03:16,160
All right, let's jump right in with my quotation. We are drowning in information,

32
0:03:16,160 --> 0:03:22,880
but starved for knowledge. And that's by John Nasebitt. And I think this is so relevant,

33
0:03:22,880 --> 0:03:28,800
because it's really this fire hose of information. We're seeing it all around COVID, but this is

34
0:03:28,800 --> 0:03:34,000
just the modern world. And we're always struggling to make sense of what does all this information

35
0:03:34,560 --> 0:03:40,800
mean? How do we actually get from information to knowledge? So hopefully we play a part in doing

36
0:03:40,800 --> 0:03:47,520
that. Let me start with the updates. How are things? Things are really much better here in the US

37
0:03:48,480 --> 0:03:54,640
here in New York. One of our local hospitals I discharged to I think is at least for the moment,

38
0:03:54,640 --> 0:03:59,680
this will be no COVID patients left in the hospital after this gentleman goes home. He's

39
0:03:59,680 --> 0:04:06,160
probably home already with his wife and twins. So that's very exciting. Other big hospitals

40
0:04:06,160 --> 0:04:12,240
in our area down to single digit numbers of COVID cases. My partner, New Julie, just admitted

41
0:04:12,240 --> 0:04:17,840
someone today with COVID. And as you can imagine, this is a woman who did not get her vaccine,

42
0:04:17,840 --> 0:04:23,920
you know, diabetic who really should have been taking that opportunity. So that's what we're

43
0:04:23,920 --> 0:04:29,120
seeing now. We're seeing younger individuals. We're seeing people who did not take the opportunity

44
0:04:29,120 --> 0:04:34,800
to get vaccinated. But the numbers really, you know, exponentially seem to be going down.

45
0:04:34,800 --> 0:04:39,520
I continue to have that optimism that we're going to be in a really great place across the

46
0:04:39,520 --> 0:04:44,400
country in July. There certainly are areas with poor vaccine uptake. And you know, you worry about

47
0:04:44,400 --> 0:04:49,360
those areas starting to see a rise when people get back indoors either because it got so gosh darn

48
0:04:49,360 --> 0:04:55,360
hot, they're in for air conditioning or when it gets cold again and people are indoors for the warmth.

49
0:04:56,640 --> 0:05:01,840
Around the world, right? I'm sort of parallel with the HIV. We are in no way at the end of this

50
0:05:01,840 --> 0:05:08,240
pandemic. And until we are more generous until we're able to get everyone in the world vaccinated,

51
0:05:08,240 --> 0:05:13,760
we are not safe joking today about first world problems where people complain about their chairs

52
0:05:13,760 --> 0:05:17,600
not as comfortable as they would like. There's plenty of places in the world without chairs,

53
0:05:17,600 --> 0:05:25,520
right? And I think that's the vaccine story at this point. I will say as we get into this,

54
0:05:25,520 --> 0:05:32,640
we certainly have evolving recommendations, have people's heads a little bit spinning. But that's

55
0:05:32,640 --> 0:05:38,400
actually what we wanted. We wanted to learn. We are not where we were a year ago. A year ago,

56
0:05:38,400 --> 0:05:43,600
we did not know much. We actually know a tremendous amount now. And as we learn more,

57
0:05:43,600 --> 0:05:50,160
as the science comes in, then we can actually revise what people are being told to do.

58
0:05:50,880 --> 0:05:55,280
What we know is safe. What we know is not safe. So we'll go through that. But I'm going to

59
0:05:55,280 --> 0:06:01,200
start with my children and COVID. This is always the crowd pleaser or not.

60
0:06:02,320 --> 0:06:08,400
Paul Offit appeared on the podcast Track the Vax with Serena Marshall. That's another one of

61
0:06:08,400 --> 0:06:15,120
the podcasts that I enjoy listening to. I actually was on, I was a guest on the 13th episode of Track

62
0:06:15,120 --> 0:06:22,000
the Vax. And Serena is wonderful. I miss that it wasn't as raw, I think as Twiv is, because at one

63
0:06:22,000 --> 0:06:26,320
point, she asked me a question. And I replied, and she just started laughing to the point where

64
0:06:26,320 --> 0:06:30,080
she had to actually stop the recording. And she edited that out. I thought that was great. But

65
0:06:30,960 --> 0:06:39,600
not all my jokes are bad. So this episode with Paul Offit was the May 18th episode. I'm giving

66
0:06:39,600 --> 0:06:49,760
a little plug for them called Next Up in Line for COVID Vaccines Kids. And it was really a great,

67
0:06:49,760 --> 0:06:56,160
great discussion between Serena and Paul. And Paul Offit brought up the fact really that I

68
0:06:56,160 --> 0:07:02,640
try to reinforce on a regular basis that yes, kids are actually at some risk. It's not huge,

69
0:07:02,640 --> 0:07:08,480
it certainly is lower. But the reason we're recommending vaccination to adolescents at this

70
0:07:08,480 --> 0:07:14,480
point is not for the greater good. It's actually to protect them. It's like putting a seatbelt on

71
0:07:14,480 --> 0:07:20,480
them, putting a helmet on them. And let me quote Paul Offit what he said during that discussion.

72
0:07:21,200 --> 0:07:27,040
You have at least 300 children who've died from this infection and estimates are it could be as

73
0:07:27,040 --> 0:07:32,800
high as 500. He's talking about just right here in the United States. He also pointed out that we

74
0:07:32,800 --> 0:07:38,080
did a really great job. I like to reinforce this initially of protecting our children early in

75
0:07:38,080 --> 0:07:45,040
the pandemic with only 2.4% of those total infections in the early months being in children.

76
0:07:46,000 --> 0:07:52,640
Now things are changing. Now children account for 24% of the infections. My colleagues, as I

77
0:07:52,640 --> 0:08:00,400
mentioned, are admitting adolescents to ICUs, number of articles and releases about the shift

78
0:08:00,400 --> 0:08:07,120
into younger ages. I'm also going to add here that per CDC, the number of confirmed multi-system

79
0:08:07,120 --> 0:08:13,680
inflammatory syndrome cases in children. So that's that Miss C is approaching 4,000.

80
0:08:13,680 --> 0:08:18,720
And there are many more that are still under investigation, including about 500 just right

81
0:08:18,720 --> 0:08:23,520
here in New York State. I don't want to blow that out of proportion because I like to say

82
0:08:23,520 --> 0:08:29,680
children are at low risk. They're not at no risk. But there are things we can do to keep these kids

83
0:08:29,680 --> 0:08:35,840
safe. It has been really difficult for a lot of these children. Actually, I will say for us parents

84
0:08:35,840 --> 0:08:40,400
to have schools closed, to have a lot of these other social and other opportunities closed. But

85
0:08:40,400 --> 0:08:47,040
there was another MMWR publication hot off the press today as we're recording this. Characteristics

86
0:08:47,040 --> 0:08:53,680
of COVID-19 cases and outbreaks at childcare facilities, District of Columbia, July through

87
0:08:53,680 --> 0:09:01,520
December 2020. And here the authors were reporting on 469 childcare facilities in the District of

88
0:09:01,520 --> 0:09:09,760
Columbia. As far as facility associated outbreaks, they occurred in 5.8% of the facilities. The other

89
0:09:09,760 --> 0:09:17,600
flip of that is you could say over 94% of the facilities had no outbreaks. The childcare facilities

90
0:09:17,600 --> 0:09:23,040
in D.C. were able to adhere to many of the recommended prevention measures and reporting

91
0:09:23,040 --> 0:09:29,040
requirements. And basically they did a good job. The kids were able to be in these settings and

92
0:09:29,040 --> 0:09:33,760
they reported that really similar to what had been observed in other studies. The rise in the

93
0:09:33,760 --> 0:09:40,880
COVID-19 cases and outbreaks correlated with level of community spread. So I think that's

94
0:09:40,880 --> 0:09:46,240
really a positive message here. We can get these kids out in these settings. We can do it safely.

95
0:09:46,240 --> 0:09:53,360
We've learned how to do that. We now have the lowest positive test rates across this country,

96
0:09:53,360 --> 0:09:58,240
actually ever. Early on when we started testing, I remember New York, like 80% of the tests were

97
0:09:58,240 --> 0:10:04,080
coming back positive. In a recent article that I tweeted out, I should tell people just follow my

98
0:10:04,640 --> 0:10:10,480
Twitter at Daniel Griffin MD because I try to get a lot of these articles out there. But really

99
0:10:10,480 --> 0:10:16,080
showing how a lack of testing plagued us early on. Now we are doing a lot of testing and you know

100
0:10:16,080 --> 0:10:20,400
you're doing enough testing or you're doing a lot of testing when you're getting a positivity rate

101
0:10:20,400 --> 0:10:27,760
of down in the 1% or 2% nationally. So really going in the right direction here for improving

102
0:10:27,760 --> 0:10:32,560
the risk for our children. I should probably tell this story here. I always try to be careful

103
0:10:32,560 --> 0:10:37,280
when I talk about risk and I talk about no risk. My wife asked me yesterday, she was going to give

104
0:10:37,280 --> 0:10:43,760
Barnaby a sandwich with a Swiss cheese, turkey and mayo and it had been an insulated thing and

105
0:10:43,760 --> 0:10:48,080
there was a blue iced thing in there. But now the blue iced thing was no longer cold. So she

106
0:10:48,080 --> 0:10:53,760
wasn't enough. It was still okay for Barnaby to put in a new blue ice pack. And I had not

107
0:10:53,760 --> 0:10:59,280
taken off my work hat. So I said, oh, that seems like a very low risk decision going ahead and

108
0:10:59,280 --> 0:11:02,960
letting you have that. My wife's response was, I don't want a low risk. I want no risk for our

109
0:11:02,960 --> 0:11:10,880
son Barnaby. I was like, no, it's fine. We can eat that's how it will be fine. So I know we want

110
0:11:10,880 --> 0:11:16,480
absolutes. But even when it comes to sandwiches, we don't have absolutes. All right, pre exposure

111
0:11:16,480 --> 0:11:24,160
transmission. On Friday, May 14th, the article interim estimates of vaccine effectiveness of Pfizer,

112
0:11:24,160 --> 0:11:31,360
BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines among healthcare personnel, 33 US sites January through

113
0:11:31,360 --> 0:11:36,960
March 2021. Right. So this is this is hot off the press. This became available as an early release.

114
0:11:37,520 --> 0:11:42,800
And on the last tweet of clinical update, Vincent had asked mainly to address questions from our

115
0:11:42,800 --> 0:11:48,160
audience about how we knew about safety and efficacy of vaccines beyond the initial large

116
0:11:48,160 --> 0:11:53,680
RCTs, right? We were talking about the latest adolescent trials, only 2,000 people in there. But

117
0:11:53,680 --> 0:11:59,920
what are they doing over time? So I brought up theirs. But here, this is one of these

118
0:12:01,600 --> 0:12:07,760
trials that continues to give us information after those RCTs. So here the authors report on a

119
0:12:07,760 --> 0:12:16,800
case control study of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine efficacy, V E with HCP healthcare personnel,

120
0:12:16,800 --> 0:12:23,040
being enrolled at these 33 sites across the United States. So these were healthcare personnel

121
0:12:23,040 --> 0:12:30,080
with the potential for exposure to SARS-CoV-2 through direct patient contact or for, you know,

122
0:12:30,080 --> 0:12:35,840
indirect exposure. So think about these are these are people who are exposed, right? So you're

123
0:12:35,840 --> 0:12:40,960
getting an exposure here. They had they had case patients, they had control participants.

124
0:12:41,600 --> 0:12:47,040
And these were being identified through routine employee testing performed onsite

125
0:12:47,600 --> 0:12:52,720
through their occupational health practices. They went ahead and the healthcare personnel with a

126
0:12:52,720 --> 0:13:00,320
positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR or antigen based test result. And at least one COVID-19 like illness

127
0:13:00,320 --> 0:13:07,520
were enrolled as the cases. And then we had the negatives being those who did not have a PCR.

128
0:13:08,160 --> 0:13:11,360
You know, it didn't matter if these people had symptoms, right? If they had something else going

129
0:13:11,360 --> 0:13:21,680
on as long as they did not have COVID. And as of March 18, 2021, 623 case patients, 1,220 controls

130
0:13:21,680 --> 0:13:30,160
were enrolled. And they gave us an effectiveness estimate of a complete 2 dose regimen of these

131
0:13:30,160 --> 0:13:38,080
vaccines at 94%, which is really actually consistent with the clinical trials. And I should say

132
0:13:38,080 --> 0:13:42,880
surprising, right? We were not expecting, you know, the real world is usually not as good as what we

133
0:13:42,880 --> 0:13:50,400
see. But what are the limitations here? So first, testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare

134
0:13:50,400 --> 0:13:55,920
providers was based on occupational health practices at each facility. And, you know,

135
0:13:55,920 --> 0:14:00,880
vaccinated people may have actually been less likely to go for testing, possibly underestimating

136
0:14:00,880 --> 0:14:04,720
the efficacy. They, you know, thinking, hey, I've been vaccinated, I'm not as worried about a

137
0:14:04,720 --> 0:14:09,680
little bit of sniffles here. So that is one issue. And the authors comment on this as well.

138
0:14:10,480 --> 0:14:15,680
Second, again, limited sample size. You know, we love our tens, our 20s, our 30,000. So this

139
0:14:15,680 --> 0:14:22,880
was not as big as sample size. And third, right? It's not clear that you can generalize this to

140
0:14:22,880 --> 0:14:30,080
the entire US population, right? So different races, different ethnic groups age, right? We've

141
0:14:30,080 --> 0:14:35,440
certainly started to get a sense that the vaccine has different efficacy based upon age, good data

142
0:14:35,440 --> 0:14:42,080
starting to support that. And fourth, the healthcare personnel with a known past SARS-CoV-2 infection

143
0:14:42,080 --> 0:14:46,000
were excluded, right? We're vaccinating those individuals, giving them protection.

144
0:14:46,640 --> 0:14:51,840
So again, are those people going to get better or worse protection than people who did not have

145
0:14:51,840 --> 0:14:57,360
that exposure prior to vaccination? We think that they may actually be even more protected. So

146
0:14:57,360 --> 0:15:04,000
that 94%, another reason why maybe even underestimation. So now this was actually the data that came out

147
0:15:04,000 --> 0:15:09,360
the day after our last Twiv and the headline, making comments by the current CDC director about

148
0:15:09,360 --> 0:15:14,560
vaccines and masking. So I certainly have gotten a lot of questions. So I'm going to spend a little

149
0:15:14,560 --> 0:15:20,800
bit of time discussing that sort of in this context. So what was that all about? So I think

150
0:15:20,800 --> 0:15:26,800
there were several points that was based on. And I think the CDC director has been really clear

151
0:15:26,800 --> 0:15:32,400
that the recommendations were science driven. And what is that science? Well, one of the bits of

152
0:15:32,400 --> 0:15:39,040
science that has just been building, and this was another brick in that wall, is that vaccines

153
0:15:39,040 --> 0:15:46,160
can be incredibly powerful at protecting a vaccinated person, right? So the person vaccinated,

154
0:15:46,160 --> 0:15:50,560
as long as they have an intact immune system, as long as they come out of response, they can

155
0:15:50,560 --> 0:15:54,800
have a tremendous amount of infection. I will be talking about people that can't get that.

156
0:15:55,920 --> 0:16:02,960
The second, and this I think is an important point, growing evidence that an asymptomatic

157
0:16:02,960 --> 0:16:09,440
vaccinated person is at very low risk for transmitting to others, right? Incredibly low

158
0:16:09,440 --> 0:16:13,760
chance that they're even going to turn PCR positive. And then we have data suggesting that if they're

159
0:16:13,760 --> 0:16:19,600
asymptomatic and PCR positive, that is at such a low level that it may actually be below level of

160
0:16:19,600 --> 0:16:24,000
transmission. So that was the second part. What are the other caveats I think that need to be put

161
0:16:24,000 --> 0:16:30,480
into this whole situation? 4% of people in the US have impaired immune systems due to disease

162
0:16:30,480 --> 0:16:36,480
or medications. So that's about 10 million people that are unable to protect themselves

163
0:16:36,480 --> 0:16:43,840
with active vaccination, right? So they are relying on the kindness, the decision to get

164
0:16:43,840 --> 0:16:51,360
vaccinated, the masking, the non pharmaceutical and the vaccine mitigation measures. The other

165
0:16:51,360 --> 0:16:58,080
is what about children 11 and under who do not have access to the vaccination and the protection

166
0:16:58,080 --> 0:17:03,840
that this could offer? That's another 50 million people here, right? Who are at risk if someone is

167
0:17:03,840 --> 0:17:10,560
unvaccinated, infected with SARS-CoV-2 and walking around? The other point that people are bringing

168
0:17:10,560 --> 0:17:16,720
up and I think is relevant is children 12 to 15 just got access. So millions of these kids who

169
0:17:16,720 --> 0:17:21,440
have not had time to get that second shot, not had time to get to that full protection.

170
0:17:21,440 --> 0:17:27,840
And so many, many, rightfully so in the US worry that unvaccinated people will be dishonest

171
0:17:28,560 --> 0:17:34,640
and take their masks off around vulnerable people and infect them giving them COVID. So

172
0:17:35,440 --> 0:17:42,480
I think there's a lot going on here. The only state that I'm aware of with any sort of a real

173
0:17:42,480 --> 0:17:51,200
robust verification system is New York here with our Excelsior Pass, which is already being used

174
0:17:51,200 --> 0:17:55,760
and already planned for use for sporting events to verify that you get to sit in that vaccinated

175
0:17:55,760 --> 0:18:02,560
section, et cetera. So remember, the CDC is not the police. They are a public health agency and

176
0:18:02,560 --> 0:18:06,960
this is the science. The policing, that's going to be someone else's job.

177
0:18:07,920 --> 0:18:12,000
Now, one of the things that comes up in this context is people who say, well, I don't know if

178
0:18:12,000 --> 0:18:18,800
I need to get a vaccine because I already had the COVID. I should be fine. So what about that?

179
0:18:18,800 --> 0:18:24,640
How much protection against reinfection do you get with prior infection? And boy, have we come

180
0:18:24,640 --> 0:18:29,280
far in a year, right? A year ago, there was the whole discussion is reinfection even a thing.

181
0:18:29,280 --> 0:18:34,560
Well, I think we've moved past that. And now really the question is, what rate are we seeing

182
0:18:34,560 --> 0:18:39,920
this? If you've been infected, what percent does that protect you relative to vaccination,

183
0:18:39,920 --> 0:18:43,920
for instance? And I've always been shocked that there's a group of people out there who would

184
0:18:43,920 --> 0:18:53,760
who would somehow prefer natural infection to a vaccine. I'm seeing a lady now who got chicken

185
0:18:53,760 --> 0:18:58,960
pox, right, instead of a vaccine. And she has this recurrent zoster all over her face. She actually

186
0:18:58,960 --> 0:19:05,760
have to wear a mask. She keeps having issues trying to get employment because at job interviews,

187
0:19:06,480 --> 0:19:11,120
this is an issue. Polio, right? I think Vincent right up your alley. If you could get a polio

188
0:19:11,120 --> 0:19:15,520
vaccine or just take that chance of maybe a little bit of paralysis for the rest of your life. I

189
0:19:15,520 --> 0:19:21,360
always shocked here. But here's some data. And this was the study Risk of SARS-CoV-2

190
0:19:21,360 --> 0:19:27,920
reinfection in a university student population published in CID, Clinical Infectious Disease.

191
0:19:28,800 --> 0:19:38,080
And they reported on a retrospective analysis of 2021 students with prior infection and 14,080

192
0:19:38,080 --> 0:19:46,880
students without previous infection. So these were age 17 to 24. And they reported an 84% lower risk

193
0:19:46,880 --> 0:19:52,560
of infection compared to the unvaccinated students over a study period of four months.

194
0:19:53,120 --> 0:19:56,880
So I just want to give a comparator here. Remember, this is an age group with almost 100%

195
0:19:56,880 --> 0:20:04,560
protection with vaccination. And here only an 84% reduction with prior infection. And this is

196
0:20:04,560 --> 0:20:11,600
just in that window just the four months. So my takeaway here is we saw dozens of reinfections

197
0:20:12,320 --> 0:20:18,480
in these young adults in this short period. Prior infection is not vaccination testing.

198
0:20:18,480 --> 0:20:24,880
Never miss an opportunity to test. We are back into the realm. I want to remind everyone of the

199
0:20:24,880 --> 0:20:31,040
indeterminate test. We now have rates that are dropping back so low that we are back to those

200
0:20:31,040 --> 0:20:35,600
issues of what is the positive predictive value and what is the negative predictive

201
0:20:35,600 --> 0:20:40,560
value of a test. And if our listeners remember that far back, but I'm glad that we're circling

202
0:20:40,560 --> 0:20:45,440
back to there. This is the situation where I'll start with sort of the high numbers.

203
0:20:45,440 --> 0:20:52,560
Back when we had a disease prevalence of 30%. If you used a test that was 80% sensitive,

204
0:20:52,560 --> 0:20:57,680
99% specific, right? We're thinking of like PCR, some of our antigen tests here.

205
0:20:57,680 --> 0:21:05,840
If a person had a positive test, 97% of the time that was truly positive. Only 3% of the time was

206
0:21:05,840 --> 0:21:12,000
that false. If it was negative, your negative predictive value is up in the 90s as well.

207
0:21:12,000 --> 0:21:16,720
But what happens when we drop to where we are now? What if the disease prevalence is down at 1%

208
0:21:17,760 --> 0:21:23,120
using that same test? If it's negative, okay, it is negative with even higher certainty than we

209
0:21:23,120 --> 0:21:29,440
had to begin with. But what if it is positive? The false positive rate now is going to exceed

210
0:21:29,440 --> 0:21:36,160
50%. It's going to be at 55%. So now it's becoming really important at a lot of our testing sites

211
0:21:36,160 --> 0:21:40,880
to have that second test ready to go. So if you get a positive, or what I will say,

212
0:21:40,880 --> 0:21:46,400
an indeterminate initial result, you want to be ready to employ a second test to determine if

213
0:21:46,400 --> 0:21:51,120
that's really a true positive. And this is also going to be a little bit of communication with

214
0:21:51,120 --> 0:21:55,440
each state's Department of Health. Do they want that indeterminate reported? How are you allowed

215
0:21:55,440 --> 0:22:00,160
to respond? All right, active vaccination never miss an opportunity to vaccinate.

216
0:22:01,120 --> 0:22:07,520
And I will call this perhaps patience is a good thing. And so we saw the preprint results of a

217
0:22:07,520 --> 0:22:13,680
study looking at extended interval boosting of the Pfizer, BioNTech vaccine entitled

218
0:22:13,680 --> 0:22:22,400
extended interval, BNT162B2 vaccination enhances peak antibody generation in older people. And

219
0:22:22,400 --> 0:22:26,960
can you guess what they saw? Well, yes, this is the secret of a well crafted title. It's all right

220
0:22:26,960 --> 0:22:34,240
there. The authors reported on 175 people over the age of 80 and found a peak antibody response

221
0:22:34,240 --> 0:22:41,040
that was 3.5 fold higher with an extended interval of 11 to 12 weeks versus the standard

222
0:22:41,040 --> 0:22:47,120
three weeks, right? So 3.5 times higher by just waiting that extra point. And I think this makes

223
0:22:47,120 --> 0:22:53,040
sense, right? We did our studies at three weeks at four weeks, you know, because as I tell my

224
0:22:53,040 --> 0:22:59,440
daughter, Eloise, 95% is good enough. We don't need 98, you know, these older individuals where

225
0:22:59,440 --> 0:23:05,280
maybe we don't have as robust responses we might like, also start thinking about those people with

226
0:23:05,280 --> 0:23:12,000
immunocompromise where there were issues, maybe an extended interval, even we'll talk in the future

227
0:23:12,000 --> 0:23:18,640
about some of these heterologous or mix and match boosting approaches. For a population,

228
0:23:18,640 --> 0:23:23,600
we may be getting where we need to be, right? Because I think it was quoted on the last

229
0:23:23,600 --> 0:23:29,120
twiv, a little bit of discussion there with Kathy and Alan and Rich and the gang about

230
0:23:29,680 --> 0:23:33,920
if someone gets vaccinated, we're only seeing your chance of dying only. And I think I'm going to

231
0:23:33,920 --> 0:23:39,520
use the word only here is one in 500,000 people. And that includes all these people who come back

232
0:23:39,520 --> 0:23:44,720
with a negative antibody test, come back with a low tight or anybody test after vaccines.

233
0:23:44,720 --> 0:23:49,840
The vaccines are incredibly effective. I don't know if we need 3.5 higher, but at least it says

234
0:23:49,840 --> 0:23:54,720
that if there is a weight, depending on your vaccination strategy, you're not getting lower

235
0:23:54,720 --> 0:23:59,600
antibodies, you're actually getting significantly higher. Three, the period of detectable viral

236
0:23:59,600 --> 0:24:04,800
replication, the viral symptom phase, as I like to say, the time for monitoring and monoclonals.

237
0:24:05,360 --> 0:24:10,720
And remember, NSAIDs are fine for symptom relief. I'm going to sort of combine pull-in passive

238
0:24:10,720 --> 0:24:15,760
vaccination and the early inflammatory phase here together. And part of it, I'm going to bring up

239
0:24:15,760 --> 0:24:22,640
the issue that timing matters. So what am I talking about here? So we finally saw the peer-reviewed

240
0:24:22,640 --> 0:24:30,080
results of the recovery trial results on convalescent plasma in patients admitted to hospital

241
0:24:30,080 --> 0:24:35,360
in the Lancet. So as people may know, I feel like that's a little bit late, right? We're waiting

242
0:24:35,360 --> 0:24:40,640
until the early inflammatory phase. We're not getting convalescent plasma in during that first

243
0:24:40,640 --> 0:24:47,520
week. Well, let's see what we saw here. The title was convalescent plasma in patients admitted to

244
0:24:47,520 --> 0:24:57,440
hospital with COVID-19 recovery, a randomized controlled open-label platform trial. And at this

245
0:24:57,440 --> 0:25:03,120
point, our listeners are perhaps familiar with their recovery trial out of the UK. And just what

246
0:25:03,120 --> 0:25:07,840
are those letters stand for? This is a randomized controlled open-label platform trial, randomized

247
0:25:07,840 --> 0:25:15,280
evaluation of COVID-19 therapy, looking really at several possible treatments in patients with

248
0:25:15,280 --> 0:25:23,920
COVID-19 in the UK. The trial is still underway at 177 NHS hospitals from across the UK.

249
0:25:24,560 --> 0:25:29,840
And this is the trial that introduced steroids at the right time, in the right patients,

250
0:25:30,640 --> 0:25:36,400
at the right dose as the standard of care. We also got some significant results from

251
0:25:36,400 --> 0:25:43,440
recovery on the potential harm and lack of benefit of HCQ. And most recently, the compelling data

252
0:25:43,440 --> 0:25:49,760
demonstrating the mortality benefits and other benefits of adding tosyllism app to steroids

253
0:25:49,760 --> 0:25:56,320
for the treatment of COVID at the right time in the right patient. And this paper describes

254
0:25:56,320 --> 0:26:03,280
the results of patients who are randomly assigned one to one to receive either usual care or usual

255
0:26:03,280 --> 0:26:10,320
care plus high-tighter convalescent plasma. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality,

256
0:26:10,320 --> 0:26:20,080
and it was analyzed on an intent to treat basis. So between May 28th, 2020 and January 15th, 2021,

257
0:26:20,080 --> 0:26:28,880
11,558 individuals were assigned to either the convalescent plasma group or the usual care group.

258
0:26:28,880 --> 0:26:35,920
And what did they find? They reported no significant difference in 28-day mortality between the two

259
0:26:35,920 --> 0:26:44,000
groups, 24% versus 24%. The 28-day mortality rate was similar in all pre-specified subgroups of

260
0:26:44,000 --> 0:26:49,440
patients. No significant effect on the proportion of patients discharged from the hospital within

261
0:26:49,440 --> 0:26:59,280
28 days, again, 66% in the convalescent plasma, 66% in the usual care. Among those not uninvasive

262
0:26:59,280 --> 0:27:04,560
mechanical ventilation at randomization, again, no significant difference in the proportion of

263
0:27:04,560 --> 0:27:09,200
patients, meaning the composite endpoint, a progression to invasive mechanical ventilation

264
0:27:09,200 --> 0:27:17,840
or death. So in summary, this was a robust, well-powered study using high-tighter convalescent plasma

265
0:27:17,840 --> 0:27:22,320
early after admission. So they were getting it in within, it was a median of two days after admission.

266
0:27:23,280 --> 0:27:29,040
No benefit was observed. If anything, I feel like I'm quoting Mark Chrislep,

267
0:27:29,040 --> 0:27:34,560
a non-statistically significant trend toward a 20% higher rate of mechanical ventilation if you

268
0:27:34,560 --> 0:27:40,480
look closely at Figure 2. So that means that, yeah, there was a trend there, but they did not actually

269
0:27:40,480 --> 0:27:46,320
find benefit anywhere. There was a little bit of a suggestion that maybe if you had a larger study,

270
0:27:46,320 --> 0:27:52,640
you would have started to see harm, actually. They also did a meta-analysis of the 10 major trials

271
0:27:52,640 --> 0:27:59,280
to date. And I will say here, again, the totality of data putting all these trials together did not

272
0:27:59,280 --> 0:28:06,480
support a benefit to convalescent plasma for hospitalized patients. Now, the authors did comment

273
0:28:06,480 --> 0:28:12,240
that recovery only included patients admitted to hospital. So this trial doesn't really address

274
0:28:12,240 --> 0:28:17,600
whether or not there's maybe a narrow window early in disease where convalescent plasma might

275
0:28:17,600 --> 0:28:26,640
provide some benefit. And that question has not yet been robustly tested in a sufficiently

276
0:28:26,640 --> 0:28:32,320
large randomized control trial. And they actually did reference a trial that we've discussed here,

277
0:28:32,320 --> 0:28:37,840
which was the New England Journal trial. This was early high Titer Plasmotherapy to prevent

278
0:28:37,840 --> 0:28:44,240
severe COVID-19 in older adults. And that was that small study with 80 patients in a geriatric

279
0:28:44,240 --> 0:28:50,480
unit in Argentina who got plasma within 72 hours. And there there was a report of some benefit on

280
0:28:50,480 --> 0:28:57,120
disease progression. So just sort of putting, I will say, the hospitalized patients really robust

281
0:28:57,120 --> 0:29:04,640
data from this trial, as well as a meta-analysis of 10 other trials, really a labor-intensive

282
0:29:04,640 --> 0:29:11,280
approach. And we're not seeing data here to support it. But is there something that's sort of similar

283
0:29:11,280 --> 0:29:17,360
that can be given during that first seven to 10 days? What about those monoclonal cocktails?

284
0:29:17,920 --> 0:29:22,960
So we got another press release. This was actually presented at a conference. But what was the

285
0:29:22,960 --> 0:29:29,760
press release? This was from Regeneron. Phase 3 data that was also presented at the American

286
0:29:29,760 --> 0:29:36,800
thoracic Society 2021 meeting. Regen Kove. So this is the Casariva Mab with

287
0:29:36,800 --> 0:29:44,640
MDivumab, reduced risk of hospitalization or death by 70% in non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

288
0:29:44,640 --> 0:29:51,600
So this was a phase three randomized double-blind placebo control trial, evaluating the Regeneron

289
0:29:51,600 --> 0:30:01,120
cocktail in 4,567 high-risk patients with COVID-19. And they studied two doses, right? The currently

290
0:30:01,120 --> 0:30:10,880
authorized 2,400 milligram dose and a 1,200 milligram dose, so half the dose. And they evaluated all

291
0:30:10,880 --> 0:30:16,320
these patients for efficacy. They all had one of the risk factors, right, to include them in this

292
0:30:16,320 --> 0:30:23,440
study. And the Regeneron Kove cocktail met its primary and all secondary endpoints with similar

293
0:30:23,440 --> 0:30:30,000
efficacy for both doses. And they saw this for 1,200 milligrams or 2,400 milligrams. So

294
0:30:30,000 --> 0:30:37,840
70% and 71% reduced risk of hospitalization or death through day 29 compared to placebo for

295
0:30:37,840 --> 0:30:46,160
both doses. A four-day shorter time to symptom resolution and reduced viral load. And that had

296
0:30:46,160 --> 0:30:56,640
a p-value of 0.0001 for both. Great safety data, as mentioned, there's thousands of individuals.

297
0:30:56,640 --> 0:31:02,560
One person had an anaphylactic reaction that resolved with therapy. A little bit more on monoclonal.

298
0:31:02,560 --> 0:31:09,200
So this was again another exciting week. Updated and expanded emergency use authorization for

299
0:31:09,200 --> 0:31:15,200
the monoclonal cocktails, now including more medical conditions. And the BMI has been dropped

300
0:31:15,200 --> 0:31:21,440
down to only being greater than 25. So just to give a sense of what that means. So for a man

301
0:31:21,440 --> 0:31:28,560
who is my height, 5 foot 10, I would only need to weigh 175 pounds or more to be allowed to

302
0:31:28,560 --> 0:31:34,800
squeeze in under BMI alone. So this is really expanding down to many of us, except maybe those

303
0:31:34,800 --> 0:31:39,520
really fit athletic people like my son, Barnaby, who keeps getting new personal records in the mile.

304
0:31:40,400 --> 0:31:47,600
But we also had, and I think this is critical to updated info on efficacy relative to different

305
0:31:47,600 --> 0:31:53,760
variants. So this is what worries me about the variants is the impact on monoclonal therapy.

306
0:31:53,760 --> 0:32:02,320
So in these new updated FDA EUA documents, there are a couple tables. There's a table looking at

307
0:32:02,880 --> 0:32:11,760
the variant substitutions and their impact on the Eli Lilly cocktail with the B117. No change

308
0:32:11,760 --> 0:32:19,760
in susceptibility. But when we get into the B1351, originally described in South Africa,

309
0:32:20,560 --> 0:32:27,760
we are seeing a 215 fold reduction in susceptibility. When we look at the P1, say originally described

310
0:32:27,760 --> 0:32:33,520
in Brazil, we are seeing greater than 46. Remember, both of these have very similar

311
0:32:33,520 --> 0:32:47,920
key substitutions. So the K417N or T, the E484K and the N501Y. And then the B1427 and the B1429,

312
0:32:47,920 --> 0:32:55,360
originally described in California, that have the L452R about a ninefold reduction. And the B1526,

313
0:32:55,360 --> 0:33:02,320
that's New York City's, that also has the E44K, that's about a 31 fold reduction in susceptibility.

314
0:33:02,320 --> 0:33:09,840
So in contrast, the Regeneron cocktail did not show any fold reduction in susceptibility

315
0:33:09,840 --> 0:33:16,800
for any of these key substitutions or for any of these variants. So it now becomes, I'll say,

316
0:33:16,800 --> 0:33:23,360
pretty critical when you're deciding which monoclonal cocktail to use to have a sense of what variants

317
0:33:23,360 --> 0:33:29,840
are prevalent in your area. Because you may be having reduced benefit to your therapy,

318
0:33:29,840 --> 0:33:33,760
if you're giving it to a patient who has one of these key substitutions.

319
0:33:33,760 --> 0:33:37,520
Still in this section, remember, this is that early inflammatory phase.

320
0:33:37,520 --> 0:33:43,600
So if those oxygen saturations drop below 94, that's when we have data that steroids,

321
0:33:43,600 --> 0:33:50,560
dexamethasone, 6 milligrams a day for 10 days, improves outcomes, is associated with a mortality

322
0:33:50,560 --> 0:33:57,040
benefit. Be careful with higher or longer doses, remdesivir, minor impact at huge expense,

323
0:33:57,040 --> 0:34:04,640
still recommending anticoagulation for our hospitalized patients. At least prophylactic dose is

324
0:34:04,640 --> 0:34:09,920
associated with improved outcomes, mortality benefit. We still really need better studies in this space.

325
0:34:09,920 --> 0:34:16,480
Oxygen and pulmonary support, as we're seeing in India, so critical to have that ability to

326
0:34:16,480 --> 0:34:22,400
deliver oxygen. Antibiotics, not helpful for treating viral infections and can be harmful.

327
0:34:22,400 --> 0:34:28,960
As we mentioned, tosyllizumab can be added to steroids in a certain subset of patients,

328
0:34:29,520 --> 0:34:35,600
appears to have a mortality benefit if used appropriately early in patients not responding to

329
0:34:35,600 --> 0:34:41,520
steroids. And all right, we're going to get into our tail phase of our discussion, our long COVID

330
0:34:41,520 --> 0:34:47,360
part. We have, finally, I have the paper, I say, finally, because this was preprint. Now it's

331
0:34:47,360 --> 0:34:54,160
published in BMJ. I spent some time going through this. The paper is risk of clinical sequelae

332
0:34:54,160 --> 0:35:00,240
after the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection, retrospective cohort study. And this was in the

333
0:35:00,240 --> 0:35:10,400
BMJ. And this was generated really from a huge data set of 266,586 individuals with SARS-CoV-2

334
0:35:10,400 --> 0:35:17,200
infection aged 18 to 65. So I sort of encourage you, we're looking at a younger group of patients

335
0:35:17,200 --> 0:35:22,480
here than some of the other studies. And at minimum, right, I'm hoping Vincent will post this on

336
0:35:22,480 --> 0:35:27,680
parasites without borders for people to link into. But I encourage listeners to go there and to

337
0:35:27,680 --> 0:35:33,200
at minimum look at figure two in this paper. There's a few takeaways from this paper.

338
0:35:33,920 --> 0:35:40,080
One of them is that 14% of adults aged less than or equal to 65 who were infected with

339
0:35:40,080 --> 0:35:46,480
SARS-CoV-2 had at least one new type of clinical sequelae that required medical care

340
0:35:46,480 --> 0:35:53,280
after the acute phase of the illness, right? So we're seeing about 14% here in the under 65.

341
0:35:54,160 --> 0:35:59,520
The people at higher risk were those people that had been in the hospital.

342
0:36:00,640 --> 0:36:04,560
Just to shout out to some of the authors, actually a couple of these authors are friends of mine.

343
0:36:04,560 --> 0:36:10,640
I work with them at United Health Group, Sarah Daugherty. We've been working on a bunch of long

344
0:36:10,640 --> 0:36:16,800
COVID stuff and Ken Cohen. We published a paper a little while back together. But let's just hit a

345
0:36:16,800 --> 0:36:22,400
little bit about why am I telling you to look at figure two. One of the really difficult things

346
0:36:22,400 --> 0:36:29,040
is that people who get acute COVID can end up with a number of other clinical sequelae at

347
0:36:29,040 --> 0:36:35,200
significantly higher levels. And what are those? Not surprising, interstitial lung disease,

348
0:36:35,200 --> 0:36:42,640
the hazard ratio for that is greater than 7.5. This is really troubling. And I know I come back

349
0:36:42,640 --> 0:36:49,840
to this a lot, but encephalopathy. This is about a hazard ratio of greater than six. And this is

350
0:36:49,840 --> 0:36:55,760
really difficult. You see a lot of really high functioning individuals who now are having difficulty

351
0:36:55,760 --> 0:37:02,320
on so many levels and actually being told, oh, it's all in your head, et cetera. Well, I guess it's

352
0:37:02,320 --> 0:37:10,800
all inside the skull. Yes, it is damage and impact on the brain. We're also seeing cardiomyopathy.

353
0:37:11,440 --> 0:37:17,360
And that's about three has ratio about three. We're seeing heart failure. We're seeing arrhythmias.

354
0:37:17,360 --> 0:37:22,640
We're seeing memory difficulty amnesia. We're seeing these people being more than twice as

355
0:37:22,640 --> 0:37:29,360
likely to develop a stroke, peripheral neuropathy. A lot of these are small fiber issues affecting

356
0:37:29,360 --> 0:37:35,360
gut motility and other things. So really a tough space. And a lot of people are trying to jump in

357
0:37:35,360 --> 0:37:42,000
and understand. And we're looking forward to the CDC guidance on this. And I guess I should say,

358
0:37:42,000 --> 0:37:47,600
we're still waiting for that really good data on people with long COVID and the impact of vaccines.

359
0:37:47,600 --> 0:37:54,640
So I'll say a friend and colleague of mine, Akiko Iwasaki up at Yale. She's actually come on Fridays

360
0:37:54,640 --> 0:38:01,280
to our Steve Goff weekly lab meetings. So I got to know her then. And she has a long COVID study.

361
0:38:01,280 --> 0:38:07,360
So people can just email covidrecovery at Yale.edu. If you have long COVID and you're thinking about

362
0:38:07,360 --> 0:38:13,360
getting a vaccine, that's a great way to connect. And then we can start getting some really good data.

363
0:38:13,360 --> 0:38:19,040
We continue to see this. I say anecdotally, which, you know, the plural of anecdote is not data.

364
0:38:19,040 --> 0:38:24,800
It's anecdotes. And so we really want to get this quantified. We want to get a sense of who gets

365
0:38:24,800 --> 0:38:29,440
better or the timing, et cetera. So all right, I'm going to close there. And I'm going to say,

366
0:38:29,440 --> 0:38:34,080
thank you everyone for your incredibly generous support going to parasites without borders

367
0:38:34,080 --> 0:38:38,160
and helping us support femric and all the great work Foundation International Medical

368
0:38:38,160 --> 0:38:43,600
Relief of Children continues to do throughout the world. These are tough times and no one safe

369
0:38:43,600 --> 0:38:50,640
until everyone is safe. Time for some questions for Daniel. You can send yours to Daniel at microbe.tv.

370
0:38:50,640 --> 0:38:57,920
Patricia writes, one topic I have not seen anywhere is drug metabolism. I seem to be a poor metabolizer

371
0:38:57,920 --> 0:39:04,240
of drugs. I've been like this my life. Even Asper cream can put me to sleep night quill. I'm out for

372
0:39:04,240 --> 0:39:10,240
24 hours. These are just two examples. At age 58, I feel getting vaccinated is important, but I

373
0:39:10,240 --> 0:39:15,840
don't dare try because of how I always react to drugs. If I can handle any, it's a child's dosage

374
0:39:15,840 --> 0:39:22,400
at best. Can you point me to more info on this? I can't seem to find any discussion on this topic

375
0:39:22,400 --> 0:39:26,800
as it relates to vaccine. Or if you know the answer to whether it would be safe for me to get

376
0:39:26,800 --> 0:39:32,400
vaccinated, that would be helpful too. Okay. Well, I'm going to encourage you to get vaccinated

377
0:39:32,400 --> 0:39:37,520
first off. But let me explain what I know. Usually I tell people, oh, these are vaccines. They're

378
0:39:37,520 --> 0:39:42,400
not something that gets metabolized. But there is a little bit of detail here. And I'll go into

379
0:39:42,400 --> 0:39:48,480
what do we know about this? People who are on particular medications that are metabolized by

380
0:39:48,480 --> 0:39:56,160
the liver so that hepatic cytochrome SIP 450 system. We actually can see sometimes, and we think it's

381
0:39:56,160 --> 0:40:01,040
cytokine induced, right? You get your vaccine, there's that reactogenicity. Sometimes if anything,

382
0:40:01,040 --> 0:40:06,240
it can increase the metabolism of certain medications. And we want to know about stuff like this,

383
0:40:06,240 --> 0:40:10,480
right? If somebody's on Warfarin, okay, no interaction there. Some other medications,

384
0:40:10,480 --> 0:40:15,200
what actually is happening here is improving the metabolism. It's speeding up to metabolism of

385
0:40:15,200 --> 0:40:19,920
certain medications. Most of the studies in this area have not suggested that it's

386
0:40:20,640 --> 0:40:26,480
of significant or clinical relevance. But yeah, there is a little bit of a subtle issue here.

387
0:40:26,480 --> 0:40:31,440
But if you're a poor metabolizer, well, temporarily, you're going to be a slightly better metabolizer.

388
0:40:31,440 --> 0:40:35,600
Victoria writes, I'm the parent of the 13 year old daughter who has down syndrome.

389
0:40:35,600 --> 0:40:40,880
My family has been careful during the year working in schooling from home, reducing our risk. But

390
0:40:40,880 --> 0:40:45,840
this has come at great cost to our 13 year old schooling and social development because remote

391
0:40:45,840 --> 0:40:50,800
school has been pretty much miserable and ineffective for her. So my household awaits with great

392
0:40:50,800 --> 0:40:55,280
anticipation. The news that we can have our door to vaccinate when Pfizer is authorized,

393
0:40:55,280 --> 0:40:59,440
but I can't help wonder, will the vaccine be sufficiently effective for people with

394
0:40:59,440 --> 0:41:04,720
down syndrome? Or is it likely that my family should expect that the vaccine will not offer our

395
0:41:04,720 --> 0:41:10,720
daughter substantial protection? I suspect there's scant empirical evidence. But what might you

396
0:41:10,720 --> 0:41:16,800
predict based on your knowledge of the immune system of folks with trisomy 21?

397
0:41:18,160 --> 0:41:24,160
Yeah, no, this, this is a great question. And we are starting to expand from just the, oh,

398
0:41:24,160 --> 0:41:29,520
how does this group of 30,000 people respond to looking at some of these other populations?

399
0:41:29,520 --> 0:41:33,840
And we discussed the last time about people with transplant, people with other immune issues.

400
0:41:33,840 --> 0:41:37,760
Now, a couple of things I'm going to say, I'm going to say I am actually quite optimistic

401
0:41:37,760 --> 0:41:41,440
from what we know about these vaccines and what we know about the immune system,

402
0:41:41,440 --> 0:41:45,680
that an individual down syndrome will get excellent. I'm going to say excellent. And

403
0:41:45,680 --> 0:41:50,640
adolescent with with down syndrome should get excellent response. We saw in the trial

404
0:41:50,640 --> 0:41:57,600
of adolescents 100% protection against even a positive PCR test with Pfizer. And that's pretty

405
0:41:57,600 --> 0:42:05,040
amazing. Let's say that you drop that down to 90%. That's still really impressive. And if it's not

406
0:42:05,040 --> 0:42:11,280
a negative PCR test, is it going to at least be, should there be a positive PCR is lower level?

407
0:42:11,920 --> 0:42:16,880
So I actually, I would optimistically say I would go ahead, I would get that vaccine.

408
0:42:16,880 --> 0:42:22,640
The efficacy looks really impressive. So even if it's a little bit reduced in

409
0:42:22,640 --> 0:42:27,760
some with down syndrome, because of the issues there, we have a lot of margin of reduction here.

410
0:42:28,640 --> 0:42:33,200
Mike in South Jersey writes, the day after receiving the second dose of Pfizer vaccine,

411
0:42:33,200 --> 0:42:37,600
I developed an irregular heartbeat. I have had symptoms the past six days,

412
0:42:37,600 --> 0:42:42,720
which tend to be worse at rest. I have yet to determine if I also have myocarditis after going

413
0:42:42,720 --> 0:42:47,360
to my primary care physician and cardiologist. I was surprised to learn that this is becoming

414
0:42:47,360 --> 0:42:51,760
more and more common. Can you please discuss this issue? Do you have any idea what might be causing

415
0:42:51,760 --> 0:42:56,720
it? I'm a 42 year old male who exercises regularly and eats healthy.

416
0:42:56,720 --> 0:42:59,840
Yeah, so I think this is great. I want to try to put this in context.

417
0:43:01,920 --> 0:43:06,000
Right now, we're getting to the point where what the majority of Americans have gotten,

418
0:43:06,000 --> 0:43:09,760
at least majority of adult Americans have gotten at least one dose of vaccine.

419
0:43:09,760 --> 0:43:14,240
So it's almost like in the history of every patient, like when their vaccines were done.

420
0:43:15,200 --> 0:43:21,040
So it's pretty soon going to be uncommon that someone was not vaccinated. So do we see myocarditis?

421
0:43:21,040 --> 0:43:25,920
Yes. Do we see myocarditis at a higher rate in people that are vaccinated? I'm not sure that's

422
0:43:25,920 --> 0:43:30,960
true. I'm speaking to one of my cardiologist colleagues today about some basically things

423
0:43:30,960 --> 0:43:35,920
that are noticing. One was the issue, oh, this individual had low platelets. And so in their

424
0:43:35,920 --> 0:43:41,440
mind, they had made a connection. This is being actively looked into, particularly with the Pfizer

425
0:43:41,440 --> 0:43:49,280
vaccine, for instance, do people who get the Pfizer vaccine have a higher incidence of really

426
0:43:49,280 --> 0:43:55,920
anything, particularly myocarditis, arrhythmias. So far, we're not seeing that looking at the vaccine

427
0:43:55,920 --> 0:44:00,880
reporting system, looking at all this robust tracking. We still see what we see. People get

428
0:44:00,880 --> 0:44:05,120
vaccinated. They get bitten by dogs. They get bitten by cats. They get in car crashes. They

429
0:44:05,120 --> 0:44:12,320
have arrhythmias. They basically, all the things that we see, we still see. And it's not clear

430
0:44:12,320 --> 0:44:16,080
that the myocarditis, the arrhythmias, are actually at a higher level. So certainly that

431
0:44:16,080 --> 0:44:21,280
doctor will say, boy, of the last so many people I saw, 60% of them had been vaccinated. But you

432
0:44:21,280 --> 0:44:29,360
know what? 60% of all people have been vaccinated. So it's sort of tricky to actually look at what

433
0:44:29,360 --> 0:44:34,800
you're seeing and then really use a robust system to determine whether or not there's any causal

434
0:44:34,800 --> 0:44:41,440
link here. That is COVID-19 clinical update number 63 with Dr. Daniel Griffin. Thank you, Daniel.

435
0:44:41,440 --> 0:45:11,280
Oh, thank you so much. And everyone be safe.
