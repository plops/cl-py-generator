0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:06,880
This week in virology, the podcast about viruses, the kind that make you sick.

2
0:00:10,320 --> 0:00:21,280
From MicroTV, this is Twiv, this week in virology, episode 710 recorded on January 21, 2021.

3
0:00:21,280 --> 0:00:27,680
I'm Vincent Racken Yello, and you're listening to the podcast all about viruses. Joining me today

4
0:00:27,680 --> 0:00:34,640
from New York, Daniel Griffin. Hello, everyone. Clinical update number 46, Daniel. I have a

5
0:00:34,640 --> 0:00:42,560
feeling we're going to pass 50. Unfortunately, we are. We will not be through this in four weeks,

6
0:00:43,120 --> 0:00:47,360
but I am going to be positive today. So let me start off. We have a lot to cover. I want to

7
0:00:47,360 --> 0:00:52,560
make sure we hit it all. And I know people are busy. You can listen to this at 1.5 or 2x if that

8
0:00:52,560 --> 0:01:00,320
helps, but two quotations by the same individual. The greatness of a community is most accurately

9
0:01:00,320 --> 0:01:06,160
measured by the compassionate action of its members. And the other same person, struggle

10
0:01:06,160 --> 0:01:13,280
is a never-ending process. Freedom is never really won. You earn it and win it every generation.

11
0:01:13,280 --> 0:01:20,560
And this was by Coretta Scott King, the wife of Martin Luther King. And I bring these up sort

12
0:01:20,560 --> 0:01:25,360
of as we go forward. You'll see where I get with this, but I think that we've been talking a lot

13
0:01:25,360 --> 0:01:32,080
about vaccinations, making sure that we are doing this in a compassionate manner. I don't think

14
0:01:32,080 --> 0:01:36,880
people have tried to not do it that way, but there's been a lot of really difficult issues,

15
0:01:36,880 --> 0:01:42,240
particularly for seniors, striving long distances, struggling through a really difficult process

16
0:01:42,800 --> 0:01:47,760
to get appointments, ending up showing up, and there's no vaccines. We'll get into that.

17
0:01:47,760 --> 0:01:53,200
But I think the others also struggle as a never-ending process. I want to remind people as we get

18
0:01:53,200 --> 0:01:59,840
through this, as we're like right now, really in really difficult times, we need to be vigilant.

19
0:01:59,840 --> 0:02:06,800
We need to continue to fight for that situation we are hoping to get to, where we are free from

20
0:02:06,800 --> 0:02:11,120
this pandemic, so that this never happens again. So I think we want to remember that.

21
0:02:11,120 --> 0:02:17,280
So my three quotations, my rules, I will call them, never miss an opportunity to vaccinate,

22
0:02:17,280 --> 0:02:21,840
never miss an opportunity to test, and never miss an opportunity to be nice.

23
0:02:22,640 --> 0:02:26,960
These are difficult times. People's tempers have been quite a little bit short. If we're

24
0:02:26,960 --> 0:02:31,680
going to get through the next few months, we have to work together. We have to be collegial,

25
0:02:31,680 --> 0:02:37,840
we have to communicate. All right, this is where I say if you're on the wrong airplane,

26
0:02:37,840 --> 0:02:44,160
if you're headed to LA, and that's not your final destination get off, I'm going to talk a lot

27
0:02:44,160 --> 0:02:49,280
about vaccination. So if you don't want to hear about vaccination, turn it off now, switch,

28
0:02:50,480 --> 0:02:59,120
go do something else. So as far as active vaccination, I want to say, I try not to talk

29
0:02:59,120 --> 0:03:02,960
that much about vaccine hesitancy because I feel like that's what's going to be the

30
0:03:02,960 --> 0:03:07,920
challenge in the future. But I do think it's critical that as physicians, we take responsibility

31
0:03:07,920 --> 0:03:13,680
for answering questions about vaccinations. I think there has been a brilliant mistake at

32
0:03:13,680 --> 0:03:19,120
many healthcare systems to think that healthcare workers would not need their questions answered

33
0:03:19,120 --> 0:03:24,480
about vaccinations. They should know already. And we've seen really a significant difference

34
0:03:24,480 --> 0:03:31,360
in success based upon people taking the time to educate healthcare workers about vaccines.

35
0:03:32,080 --> 0:03:38,320
UCSF, well over 80%, when they first said, hey, we've got vaccines, they said, when can I get what?

36
0:03:38,320 --> 0:03:44,720
Mass General, it was in the mid 70s, pro health, I think I mentioned it was over 90% when the call

37
0:03:44,720 --> 0:03:50,080
came out who wants to get vaccinated. But we're hearing that some of the large healthcare systems

38
0:03:50,080 --> 0:03:55,120
here in New York that less than half of their providers and staff are signing up to be vaccinated.

39
0:03:55,120 --> 0:03:59,760
So just because someone's in healthcare doesn't mean they don't have questions that need to be

40
0:03:59,760 --> 0:04:04,960
answered. And I think if we don't give the education, if we don't answer the questions and the public

41
0:04:04,960 --> 0:04:09,600
starts seeing that healthcare providers are not getting vaccinated, that's going to come back to

42
0:04:09,600 --> 0:04:16,560
haunt us down the road. And now this is sort of an FAQ. I get so many questions about vaccines,

43
0:04:16,560 --> 0:04:22,400
so I'm going to start hitting them here. Because remember, this is my chance to answer the questions

44
0:04:22,400 --> 0:04:27,920
for all the curious pro health clinicians and our listening audience. It saves me a ton of

45
0:04:27,920 --> 0:04:33,600
texts and emails a day. But one of the first questions, are we underselling the benefits of

46
0:04:33,600 --> 0:04:38,640
the vaccines? So there's a really nice piece in the New York Times, underselling the vaccine

47
0:04:39,360 --> 0:04:46,000
by David Leonhart. And they quoted our buddy Paul Hotez. If you're an anti-vaxxer and you're still

48
0:04:46,000 --> 0:04:51,760
tuning in, he's the one that likes to get your messages. He draws a parallel, David does,

49
0:04:52,560 --> 0:04:57,920
between underselling the vaccines and sort of the early mask wearing we don't quite know yet,

50
0:04:57,920 --> 0:05:06,080
etc. I don't know if that holds completely true. We try not to get ahead of the science. And I

51
0:05:06,080 --> 0:05:12,960
know that bothers people, but we as scientists, we as as clinicians, the vaccines appear to be

52
0:05:12,960 --> 0:05:18,640
really effective. We are really thinking that they're going to have an impact on transmission.

53
0:05:18,640 --> 0:05:23,680
We don't have the transmission data yet. But I'm going to talk a little about sort of the advice.

54
0:05:23,680 --> 0:05:28,320
Because yeah, why is everyone saying I still have to wear a mask? We're just saying that now.

55
0:05:28,320 --> 0:05:36,480
We are hoping we will be able to change. Should a person wait 90 days after acute infection

56
0:05:36,480 --> 0:05:44,560
before they get that vaccination? Well, what does the CDC as per the CDC, there's no recommended

57
0:05:44,560 --> 0:05:51,520
minimal interval between infection and vaccination. So some physicians are recommending people wait

58
0:05:51,520 --> 0:05:56,480
months after infection get vaccinated. But I have to say several people, including Tom Frieden,

59
0:05:56,480 --> 0:06:02,480
Eleanor Murray up at Boston University. And I'm going to jump in on this too. I am concerned.

60
0:06:02,480 --> 0:06:07,760
We are concerned that when you tell people to wait 90 days, right now they're all excited.

61
0:06:07,760 --> 0:06:12,000
They want to get vaccinated. I don't know how they're going to feel in 90 days. You don't want

62
0:06:12,000 --> 0:06:16,560
to feed the anti-vax movement. There's no science that says you have to wait. Person feels fine.

63
0:06:16,560 --> 0:06:22,560
They've recovered from their infection. My answer is in line, I'll say with the CDC, which is back.

64
0:06:22,560 --> 0:06:29,040
Welcome back CDC. You know, never miss an opportunity to vaccinate. If you say wait three months,

65
0:06:29,040 --> 0:06:34,960
you are missing that opportunity. Let's not do that. I have heard people who previously had

66
0:06:34,960 --> 0:06:40,320
COVID and then had a bad reaction to the vaccine, right? Sort of feeds into that first one. Should

67
0:06:40,320 --> 0:06:48,160
people who have had COVID still get vaccinated? And again, the CDC is very clear here on encouraging

68
0:06:48,160 --> 0:06:54,400
all to get vaccinated. We've definitely seen people have reactogenicity. So significant

69
0:06:54,400 --> 0:07:00,000
reactions after the vaccine. Some of those people had COVID before. Some of the people did not.

70
0:07:00,640 --> 0:07:06,800
So only anecdotes. Millions of people have been vaccinated. No clear science to support this

71
0:07:06,800 --> 0:07:12,640
fear. So when you hear, oh, I had COVID and I had a bad reaction. There's a there's a matching person

72
0:07:12,640 --> 0:07:20,960
who never had COVID and had a rough reaction. So people who are not vaccinated. We're concerned

73
0:07:20,960 --> 0:07:25,920
that can get reinfected. We're concerns that just because your first time with COVID wasn't so bad.

74
0:07:26,720 --> 0:07:33,840
Maybe the second time will be worse. So I've certainly certainly seen people who had COVID

75
0:07:33,840 --> 0:07:42,080
earlier on. And we've certainly seen many reports of reinfection. So the vaccine protection is better

76
0:07:42,080 --> 0:07:48,160
than natural exposure. If a person had a severe reaction from the first vaccination, what should

77
0:07:48,160 --> 0:07:53,680
they expect from the second shot? So in general, and this is what the science suggested when we

78
0:07:53,680 --> 0:07:59,600
have the early studies. This is what our experience is reinforcing. The first reaction, whatever you

79
0:07:59,600 --> 0:08:04,000
get, it's usually a little bit more significant the second time. So if they'll kind of achy a

80
0:08:04,000 --> 0:08:08,720
little tired the first time, you will probably feel a little more achy, a little more tired

81
0:08:08,720 --> 0:08:15,280
the second time. If that reaction was rather severe, then I think it's reasonable for that person to

82
0:08:15,280 --> 0:08:21,840
have a conversation with an educated person, a physician, I'm going to say here, who is familiar

83
0:08:21,840 --> 0:08:27,760
with with this situation. I've done several consultations. And I think this makes sense. I

84
0:08:27,760 --> 0:08:30,960
mean, a lot of people don't want to be heard of like cattle. They don't want to be marched

85
0:08:30,960 --> 0:08:35,200
through the Javits Center. Particularly, I'll say older individuals, they may want to sit down.

86
0:08:35,200 --> 0:08:38,880
They may want to have a conversation with their primary care physician or infectious

87
0:08:38,880 --> 0:08:44,320
disease specialist, someone familiar with vaccination. People want to talk to their doctors. That's

88
0:08:44,320 --> 0:08:49,200
fine. And actually, I encourage that. And I think this feeds into what I talked up front about.

89
0:08:50,080 --> 0:08:54,560
We haven't tried to do this. We haven't tried to be cruel. We haven't tried to make this process

90
0:08:54,560 --> 0:08:59,760
difficult. But in a lot of ways, it has been difficult. Particularly now, as we've rolled it out to

91
0:08:59,760 --> 0:09:05,520
older individuals, I describe the situation where my mom, unfortunately, had some challenges.

92
0:09:06,320 --> 0:09:10,800
And you know, just here she is in a strange situation. She's not with a health care provider,

93
0:09:10,800 --> 0:09:16,800
she trusts. I described an individual in his 80s who drove two and a half hours to Mount Sinai,

94
0:09:16,800 --> 0:09:22,960
only to find out that the vaccines have been taken to the Javits Center. We need to do a better job.

95
0:09:22,960 --> 0:09:27,520
And I think that's about to happen. That's the optimism here. We are about to have a really

96
0:09:27,520 --> 0:09:34,560
good national plan. And that's what I'm hearing. What about people that had multi-system inflammatory

97
0:09:34,560 --> 0:09:38,960
issues with COVID? Should they get vaccinated? And I had a very interesting

98
0:09:40,000 --> 0:09:45,520
individual that I took care of this last weekend. It's actually a physician that I know. And we took

99
0:09:45,520 --> 0:09:50,480
care of him back in April, when he actually developed what we believe was an autoimmune,

100
0:09:50,480 --> 0:09:57,600
mediated ataxia. He ended up with steroids IVG then. He actually developed those symptoms

101
0:09:57,600 --> 0:10:05,680
about 14 days into his acute illness. Back in December, he got his vaccine. And about 14

102
0:10:05,680 --> 0:10:10,240
days later, he noticed that he was having trouble writing. He noticed his eyes were sort of wandering

103
0:10:10,240 --> 0:10:17,360
a little bit, noticed a little bit of ataxia. Tried to set him up in the outpatient setting for

104
0:10:17,360 --> 0:10:23,840
steroids and IVG. Welcome to the world of private insurance. Pre-offs were required.

105
0:10:23,840 --> 0:10:28,000
He ended up requiring hospitalization to get that therapy. He is feeling better.

106
0:10:28,640 --> 0:10:36,160
So a person who has severe COVID the first time around or had what we think was an auto

107
0:10:36,560 --> 0:10:41,440
antibody-mediated issue, that's an individual who should consult with a physician. That makes

108
0:10:41,440 --> 0:10:46,880
sense. Consult with a physician, come up with a plan. I guess that's a recurring theme. I don't

109
0:10:46,880 --> 0:10:51,920
think everyone needs to... We saw a little bit of a disaster at Jones Beach, where you had all

110
0:10:51,920 --> 0:10:58,720
these older individuals sitting for hours in this line of cars, waiting for sort of the hurting

111
0:10:58,720 --> 0:11:03,360
cattle car approach to vaccination. That's fine for some people, but a lot of other people need a

112
0:11:03,360 --> 0:11:07,760
different setting for them to have vaccination. A lot of people would probably need something

113
0:11:07,760 --> 0:11:11,840
where there's a home visit, where someone can come to the home. There's a lot of homebound

114
0:11:11,840 --> 0:11:17,600
individuals. This is the big one. I get this all the time. I think I get this because people don't

115
0:11:17,600 --> 0:11:22,640
like my answer and they want to hear a new one. Do I still need to wear a mask if all my friends

116
0:11:22,640 --> 0:11:30,160
have been vaccinated? Now, this really comes down to the issue as I talked about. We do not have

117
0:11:30,160 --> 0:11:35,520
the science yet to tell us about transmissibility, but let's run through a couple scenarios.

118
0:11:35,520 --> 0:11:41,280
I'm going to use my mom again. I think she likes that I talk about her. Here's a woman in her 80s.

119
0:11:42,160 --> 0:11:48,400
My youngest brother, Ben, he has twins, and he just had a new baby over the last year. My mother

120
0:11:48,400 --> 0:11:54,960
is dying to go down and see him. When she has gotten her second shot and two weeks go by,

121
0:11:55,600 --> 0:12:00,320
is it okay for her to go down to visit my younger brother, to hug her grandchildren?

122
0:12:00,320 --> 0:12:07,200
From her perspective, she's safe. I'm going to say, mom, you can go. Now, my brother has to

123
0:12:07,200 --> 0:12:11,760
look at the fact that my mom, even though she's vaccinated, she still potentially could get

124
0:12:11,760 --> 0:12:17,440
transmit to him. But I think we need to start looking at this. A lot of older individuals,

125
0:12:17,440 --> 0:12:21,600
and I'm going to live forever. They've missed a lot of really important things.

126
0:12:21,600 --> 0:12:25,040
Do they want to get out of the house? Do they want to hug their kids? Do they want to have that

127
0:12:25,040 --> 0:12:32,000
at human contact? The vaccine really protects them. They're in the bulletproof car. The rest of

128
0:12:32,000 --> 0:12:37,200
the people that are not vaccinated still still at risk don't think a vaccinated person is less at

129
0:12:37,200 --> 0:12:42,000
risk. And that also relates the same to quarantine issues. If someone's been vaccinated, and now

130
0:12:42,000 --> 0:12:46,880
they're exposed to someone, all the quarantine stuff applies. When I'm so much worried about

131
0:12:46,880 --> 0:12:55,680
them, it's, again, worried about transmission risk. So if you had a reaction to an mRNA vaccine,

132
0:12:55,680 --> 0:13:00,640
then is it fine to just go ahead with the J&J vaccine? Because everyone thinks that's about to

133
0:13:01,280 --> 0:13:07,440
come out and get EUA in the coming weeks. Now, it's not entirely clear that it's safe to

134
0:13:07,440 --> 0:13:11,760
just go ahead with the J&J. And one of the issues is that we think a lot of the allergic

135
0:13:11,760 --> 0:13:17,680
reactions are due to PEG, polyethylene glycol 2000. And there's a very similar

136
0:13:18,880 --> 0:13:24,400
polysorbate that is in the adenoviral vaccine. So there may be some cross reactivity.

137
0:13:25,840 --> 0:13:32,000
We don't know, just to say we don't know, we do think that the protein vaccine by Novavax

138
0:13:32,640 --> 0:13:37,040
will sort of be safer because it's not going to have it in there. But one of the things I'm

139
0:13:37,040 --> 0:13:43,680
going to say, we'll end up talking a lot about J&J. The J&J platform has been given to over 200,000

140
0:13:43,680 --> 0:13:50,320
people. We are not seeing the significant level of the anaphylactic and allergic reactions we're

141
0:13:50,320 --> 0:13:54,880
seeing with the mRNA vaccine. So I want to throw that in there. This will be a judgment call.

142
0:13:54,880 --> 0:13:59,280
Again, you got a bad reaction with the first vaccine. You're going to have to make a decision

143
0:13:59,280 --> 0:14:02,880
with someone knowledgeable. And you want to probably consider getting that vaccine in a setting

144
0:14:02,880 --> 0:14:07,440
where you can have a longer observation period and be treated if you have any issue.

145
0:14:09,040 --> 0:14:16,160
Now, this is going to be sort of an operational in the weeds. We are trying not to throw out

146
0:14:16,160 --> 0:14:19,920
additional doses. So what happens? And I want to sort of describe this for people.

147
0:14:20,960 --> 0:14:25,280
We're going to be doing our second round of vaccinations for pro health. We did what we

148
0:14:25,280 --> 0:14:30,240
were supposed to write. We got our 1,200 vaccines. And we immediately gave all those 1,200 vaccines

149
0:14:30,240 --> 0:14:33,600
to all our employees, and they're gone. We didn't put any in the freezer. I mean,

150
0:14:34,320 --> 0:14:39,200
I don't think that surprises any of our listeners, but I am a big fan of vaccines go into people's

151
0:14:39,200 --> 0:14:46,560
arms, not into freezers. Now, we are going to get our next shipment on Tuesday. It's arriving. And

152
0:14:46,560 --> 0:14:52,240
this is a change. We actually were told ahead of time yesterday, we actually were told,

153
0:14:52,240 --> 0:14:57,200
hey, by the way, just to confirm you will be getting your second dose vaccines coming next

154
0:14:57,200 --> 0:15:03,120
Tuesday. Now, when we did our first vaccines, what we saw several times was that instead of

155
0:15:03,120 --> 0:15:08,000
there being just 10 doses in the bio, there might be 11. You might actually have a bio with 12 doses.

156
0:15:08,640 --> 0:15:14,240
So in certain circumstances, instead of doing just 10 people, we did that 11th person. We're

157
0:15:14,240 --> 0:15:20,400
now hoping now, right, when we get our second 1,200 doses, do we have those extra few doses

158
0:15:20,400 --> 0:15:24,800
that we gave to people? And again, as the issue, like let's say it's the first night,

159
0:15:24,800 --> 0:15:31,440
and I worked at one place with that long beach. And I was there for a couple hours and I did 31

160
0:15:31,440 --> 0:15:35,440
vaccinations, right? So that was three vials. One of the vials had an extra dose. So we got that

161
0:15:35,440 --> 0:15:42,400
31st person. I am hoping that things work in our favor. We also have 31. But what if we have a

162
0:15:42,400 --> 0:15:49,120
vial, which has only 10, 10, 10? What do we do with that extra person? We don't want to send

163
0:15:49,120 --> 0:15:54,320
them away. Do you open another vial? This is where we're talking about coordination. We're actually

164
0:15:54,320 --> 0:15:59,440
going to set up a call center so that people can say, okay, I don't want to open a new vial

165
0:15:59,440 --> 0:16:05,200
for one person. But if you drive 15 minutes, our free port site will have a vaccine. So people

166
0:16:05,200 --> 0:16:09,760
really need to be thinking through the logistics here. We do not want to throw vaccines to the

167
0:16:09,760 --> 0:16:15,360
trash. And I'm going to quote George Benjamin, the president of the American Public Health

168
0:16:15,360 --> 0:16:21,920
Association. Principle number one is don't waste the vaccines. I'm very excited. I have to say

169
0:16:21,920 --> 0:16:26,960
that Dr. Kessler is going to be the head of the Biden Task Force. He's been talking a lot about

170
0:16:26,960 --> 0:16:33,280
improving the operations of getting vaccines out there. We're expected to have transparency

171
0:16:33,280 --> 0:16:40,080
on how many doses are produced, where those doses are. And at the end, we really want to

172
0:16:40,080 --> 0:16:44,960
increase the efficiency. And he uses the analogy of the airplane. I feel like maybe we use that

173
0:16:44,960 --> 0:16:50,720
here. You know, you find out we've got most of the people in first class boarded. But somebody's

174
0:16:50,720 --> 0:16:55,440
running 15 minutes late. You start boarding the rest of the airplane. And when that person who

175
0:16:55,440 --> 0:17:00,320
shows up 15 minutes late, you get them in as well. Let's make things move forward. Let's make this

176
0:17:00,320 --> 0:17:06,320
efficient. Let's move away from this, you know, threat of punishment when you do things wrong

177
0:17:06,880 --> 0:17:11,040
to getting those doses in people's arms and the dialect being how can we help.

178
0:17:12,000 --> 0:17:15,680
All right, that's it for vaccines, active vaccines.

179
0:17:15,680 --> 0:17:22,240
Now, what about the pre-exposure period, right? Just want to hit a little bit on testing.

180
0:17:22,960 --> 0:17:30,160
There was a Bynax now antigen test sensitivity for culture positive specimens

181
0:17:30,960 --> 0:17:41,440
showed a 92.6% and a 78.6% for those symptomatic and asymptomatic. So again, sort of reinforcing

182
0:17:41,440 --> 0:17:47,840
that people who have a high level of virus, people who are in that infectious period that the antigen

183
0:17:48,480 --> 0:17:55,200
is actually really a great way of picking those folks up. This was in the MMWR. So it's nice to

184
0:17:55,200 --> 0:17:59,120
get a little more information. I don't think we have as much information as we would like on

185
0:17:59,120 --> 0:18:05,200
asymptomatic persons using our testing technology. So great to have a little more information there.

186
0:18:05,200 --> 0:18:11,600
Now we get up to passive vaccination. So here we are. We're the period of detectable viral

187
0:18:11,600 --> 0:18:18,720
replication. A person has symptoms. It's week one. What can we do during week one? If the person

188
0:18:18,720 --> 0:18:25,760
meets criteria, this is when we jump in with our monoclonal antibody therapy. So we heard a little

189
0:18:25,760 --> 0:18:32,160
bit about bamlinibimab, the Mayo experience greater than 2,000 patients. And then they're

190
0:18:32,160 --> 0:18:39,280
suggesting an efficacy of 70% and a mortality benefit. But I'm also going to talk a little bit.

191
0:18:39,280 --> 0:18:44,400
This is an exciting day. We're recording this on the 21st of January. But we actually got a

192
0:18:44,400 --> 0:18:50,880
little more information from Eli Lilly. And they actually released some data where they were

193
0:18:50,880 --> 0:19:00,160
looking at giving this antibody, bam, bam, bamlinibimab, to nursing homes. So residents and staff at

194
0:19:00,160 --> 0:19:07,280
skilled nursing and assisted living facilities. And what they did is this was a study 965 participants

195
0:19:07,280 --> 0:19:13,680
start off with a baseline negative for SARS-CoV-2 virus. So there were 299 residents. There were

196
0:19:13,680 --> 0:19:21,840
666 staff. And basically they're following to who gets infected and does anyone die? And they

197
0:19:21,840 --> 0:19:26,720
actually in this, which right now it's still the press release stage. I'll be excited when I see

198
0:19:26,720 --> 0:19:35,600
per review. But the residents randomized to bamlinibimab had an 80% lower risk of developing COVID-19.

199
0:19:36,880 --> 0:19:42,880
The individuals in the placebo group, there were four deaths. There were zero deaths in the

200
0:19:42,880 --> 0:19:48,880
residents that received the bamlinibimab. And those were four deaths due to COVID. So continuing to

201
0:19:48,880 --> 0:19:55,120
get more information on the bamlinibimab, we have our trial up and running at United in research.

202
0:19:55,120 --> 0:20:00,560
We've already been infusing people in home. So we're hoping to get more and more information.

203
0:20:00,560 --> 0:20:05,840
So people go to United in research. It's the lead study there. They pre-register while they're

204
0:20:05,840 --> 0:20:12,560
still healthy. And then if an individual develops COVID, the system is activated. And we are giving

205
0:20:12,560 --> 0:20:17,840
in-home infusions, which ideally is when this therapy and how this therapy should be given.

206
0:20:18,800 --> 0:20:22,720
All right. The early inflammatory phase, I'm going to hit on vitamin D again.

207
0:20:22,720 --> 0:20:29,520
Nice article. Vitamin D status is associated with in-hospital mortality and mechanical ventilation,

208
0:20:29,520 --> 0:20:34,320
a cohort of COVID-19 hospitalized patients. And this was Mayo Clinic proceedings.

209
0:20:35,520 --> 0:20:42,160
Retrospective observational cohort study. Done it to tertiary academic medical centers in Boston

210
0:20:42,720 --> 0:20:49,200
and New York. Eligible patients had to be hospitalized. And they basically broke them down into people

211
0:20:49,200 --> 0:20:55,520
that had very high vitamin D levels, so greater than 30 nanograms per milliliter and people that

212
0:20:55,520 --> 0:21:02,080
had very low, so say less than 30 nanograms per milliliter. So people that had very high levels,

213
0:21:02,080 --> 0:21:11,520
9.2% mortality, people that had low levels, 25.3% mortality. So we're actually seeing, again,

214
0:21:11,520 --> 0:21:16,880
at least when you come in, it's very predictive, actually predictive for need for mechanical ventilation.

215
0:21:16,880 --> 0:21:24,720
So keep those vitamin D levels up. Again, we do not know. We've seen studies both ways on

216
0:21:24,720 --> 0:21:28,640
once you get into the hospital, but we're trying to avoid that, trying to keep people out of the

217
0:21:28,640 --> 0:21:34,160
hospital. Again, we don't know that if you prospectively brought people's levels up, brought it down,

218
0:21:34,160 --> 0:21:39,200
or if this is more of a marker for something else, but just more information out there on vitamin D.

219
0:21:39,200 --> 0:21:46,400
Anti-quagulation. I know I talked a little bit last time about the full dose. Anti-quagulation

220
0:21:46,400 --> 0:21:53,520
was removed from some of the ACTIV trials, but now we actually saw intermediate dose,

221
0:21:53,520 --> 0:22:01,440
anti-quagulation, aspirin, and in-hospital mortality in COVID-19, a propensity score-matched analysis.

222
0:22:02,160 --> 0:22:08,960
This came out as a preprint from some researchers and clinicians up at Yale. And we know that

223
0:22:08,960 --> 0:22:16,160
clotting complications are common. We know that this is a major issue in COVID, and some degree

224
0:22:16,160 --> 0:22:22,240
of anti-quagulation is standard, but we're still trying to clarify what dose, what agent. Nice to

225
0:22:22,240 --> 0:22:29,360
see a little data here, more data here on aspirin being thrown into the mix here. And they actually

226
0:22:29,360 --> 0:22:34,480
were looking, they were comparing intermediate, which is sort of, we'll say, if you're going to use

227
0:22:34,480 --> 0:22:39,440
low-molecoate heparin, clinicians are listening in now, instead of the once a day, you might go up

228
0:22:39,440 --> 0:22:46,000
to twice a day. That's our intermediate. We might go up to twice a day for weight-based dosing.

229
0:22:46,640 --> 0:22:52,560
And this study actually suggested that there was a benefit to intermediate dosing, also a benefit

230
0:22:52,560 --> 0:22:57,600
to being on aspirin, so sort of using intermediate, slightly higher-dose anti-quagulation, not full

231
0:22:57,600 --> 0:23:04,640
dose, and anti-aspirate as well. All right, what about IL-6 receptor inhibition? I know it's been

232
0:23:04,640 --> 0:23:12,080
a while since I've talked about tosyllizumab, but we have some new data out. The REM cap,

233
0:23:12,080 --> 0:23:18,560
interleukin-6 receptor antagonist in critically ill patients with COVID-19, a preliminary report.

234
0:23:19,520 --> 0:23:26,160
So this was a randomized embedded multi-factorial adaptive platform trial for community acquired

235
0:23:26,160 --> 0:23:35,040
pneumonia, so you get your REM-CAP, and adult patients with COVID-19 within 24 hours of

236
0:23:35,040 --> 0:23:40,960
commencing organ support in an ICU. So we're looking here at timing. We're also looking at a

237
0:23:40,960 --> 0:23:46,720
background of steroids. So over 93% of these people had a background of steroids. We're going to

238
0:23:46,720 --> 0:23:52,880
hit on that again. But it wasn't being given to people in late stage. It wasn't given to people

239
0:23:52,880 --> 0:23:58,080
particularly early. It was given right when we saw an escalation of, I'm going to say,

240
0:23:58,080 --> 0:24:03,520
the cytokine storm. So the timing was what we've talked about. People were either randomized to

241
0:24:03,520 --> 0:24:10,480
receive the tosyllizumab or seruleumab, another IL-6 receptor antagonist, or standard of care.

242
0:24:11,040 --> 0:24:19,840
And the primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. So this is hospital mortality was 28% for people

243
0:24:19,840 --> 0:24:26,400
that got tosy, 22% for people that got seruleumab, and 36% for controls.

244
0:24:27,440 --> 0:24:35,200
So this gives us about a 22 to a 38% reduction in mortality, statistically significant.

245
0:24:35,840 --> 0:24:41,760
So again, the advantages of this trial background, pre-medication with steroids. The tosyllizumab

246
0:24:41,760 --> 0:24:47,680
is given what most of us have said for a while here is the right stage during the early inflammatory

247
0:24:47,680 --> 0:24:54,480
stage, people that are progressing. And actually about 30% of the folks got a second dose of tosyllizumab.

248
0:24:55,120 --> 0:25:01,440
So just to sort of recap here, we now have the impact to trial with a 44% reduction in need

249
0:25:01,440 --> 0:25:06,800
for mechanical intervention with use of tosy in a background of steroids. The covecta trial

250
0:25:06,800 --> 0:25:12,560
demonstrating a reduction in hospital duration. And now the REMCAP data showing a rather impressive

251
0:25:12,560 --> 0:25:19,040
mortality benefit if given after steroids with attention to timing. And now we're waiting for

252
0:25:19,040 --> 0:25:27,120
the recovery trial. Now on one slash 11, January 11, the recovery trial, independent data monitoring

253
0:25:27,120 --> 0:25:32,400
committee recommended continuing recruitment to their tosyllizumab treatment arm. So that's

254
0:25:32,400 --> 0:25:38,160
encouraging. This is going to give us data on about 3000 individuals with a background of steroids

255
0:25:38,160 --> 0:25:43,120
in COVID in the UK. So at least when they looked over, they were not seeing any reason why they

256
0:25:43,120 --> 0:25:47,920
should stop. So that will be helpful to really clarify the role and timing of tosyllizumab.

257
0:25:49,040 --> 0:25:54,480
Okay, the secondary infection phase. Another nice article prevalence of

258
0:25:54,480 --> 0:26:00,720
co-infection at the time of hospital admission in COVID-19 patients, a multi-center study.

259
0:26:00,720 --> 0:26:06,880
This is an open form infectious disease. Yes, that is a fine journal reporting they looked at

260
0:26:06,880 --> 0:26:13,520
over 1000 patients. And at the time of admission, only about 1% had what they felt were bacterial

261
0:26:13,520 --> 0:26:19,920
respiratory co-infections, reinforcing looking at this disease as far as timing. When people come

262
0:26:19,920 --> 0:26:26,400
in the door, it is really uncommon, less than 10%, maybe closer to 1%. If there's a bacterial

263
0:26:26,400 --> 0:26:32,800
process going on, it's the later stage. It's week three when we really start seeing the infections.

264
0:26:32,800 --> 0:26:38,720
And at that point, we see combination. We see a lot of bacterimias, we see pneumonias,

265
0:26:38,720 --> 0:26:44,480
we see incidents of fungal. Multi-system inflammatory phase comes sort of at that.

266
0:26:44,480 --> 0:26:49,520
It's important to keep reinforcing the bi-modal aspect of the inflammatory process. We have

267
0:26:49,520 --> 0:26:53,840
the early inflammatory, and then we have the late or the multi-system inflammatory phase.

268
0:26:54,560 --> 0:26:58,640
We haven't been hearing much about this. I don't know if there's so much any more

269
0:26:58,640 --> 0:27:03,920
new news as much as now we appreciate this. We're addressing it sometimes children,

270
0:27:03,920 --> 0:27:08,240
sometimes adults. We don't even see them in the hospital. Initially, they come in just

271
0:27:08,240 --> 0:27:14,480
during this late stage. The tail phase, a number more studies. I actually really appreciate the

272
0:27:14,480 --> 0:27:23,040
attention here. One of the studies was COVID-19 post acute care study group persistent symptoms

273
0:27:23,040 --> 0:27:28,880
in patients after acute COVID. That was in JAMA looking at 143 Italian patients hospitalized

274
0:27:28,880 --> 0:27:35,600
for COVID-19. Eighty-three percent continued to have at least one symptom. Sixty days post

275
0:27:35,600 --> 0:27:41,760
discharge, right? So reinforcing this isn't you just get better. Another study, COVID-19 symptoms,

276
0:27:41,760 --> 0:27:46,960
longitudinal evolution and persistent in outpatient settings in the annals of internal medicine.

277
0:27:46,960 --> 0:27:53,920
This was 669 Swiss patients with positive tests for COVID-19. Mostly outpatients, right? So

278
0:27:53,920 --> 0:28:01,360
32 percent continued to have at least one symptom at a mean of 43 days after discharge. So even

279
0:28:01,360 --> 0:28:07,680
your mild folks, even your outpatients, continuing to see symptoms here. So let's want to thank

280
0:28:07,680 --> 0:28:13,200
everyone for taking the time. We're still doing our fundraiser, still trying to help the P-score

281
0:28:13,200 --> 0:28:19,280
HIV and AIDS program. So go to parasiteswithoutborders.com, go to donate and help us continue to do what

282
0:28:19,280 --> 0:28:23,680
we're doing as well as support the P-score. All right, Daniel, a couple questions. I had one

283
0:28:23,680 --> 0:28:28,240
and you partially answered, but let me just confirm. So if someone is fully vaccinated,

284
0:28:28,240 --> 0:28:31,920
two doses and they're exposed to someone, you said they should still be quarantined,

285
0:28:31,920 --> 0:28:35,360
but that is a nine day, not a 14 day quarantine. Is that correct?

286
0:28:35,360 --> 0:28:44,000
So quarantine versus isolated. So, you know, I try to make the distinction and it really only

287
0:28:44,000 --> 0:28:50,560
matters in certain states. So, you know, the CDC has made it 10 and 10. They've lined them

288
0:28:50,560 --> 0:28:55,520
right up. So if you're infected, you wait 10 days. Actually, it was a really nice study showing

289
0:28:56,080 --> 0:29:01,840
that after nine days, you're really not seeing, they were not able to culture virus, right? So that

290
0:29:01,840 --> 0:29:07,200
was really good on the isolated for the infected. The quarantine, this has gotten a little bit.

291
0:29:07,200 --> 0:29:12,480
The CDC said, let's just use the 10 days. They've even talked about a seven day test out,

292
0:29:12,480 --> 0:29:17,120
where you just you quarantine for seven days. If you're still feeling fine at day seven, you get

293
0:29:17,120 --> 0:29:23,040
a test. You can end your quarantine early. You could just wait for 10 if you don't want to test

294
0:29:23,040 --> 0:29:28,880
and just do symptoms. This was analyzed. You will miss about 20%, about 20% of people will

295
0:29:28,880 --> 0:29:32,960
develop symptoms, or turn positive if you use the seven day test that option.

296
0:29:34,800 --> 0:29:36,880
What about vaccinated people? Is there a day?

297
0:29:38,880 --> 0:29:42,480
We're not we don't treat them any differently yet, just because we don't we don't know.

298
0:29:42,480 --> 0:29:45,600
And it is tough. People are like, come on. I've been vaccinated. What am I doing?

299
0:29:45,600 --> 0:29:49,120
Yeah, it's not about you. This is about transmission.

300
0:29:49,120 --> 0:29:51,040
Okay. We just don't know, but we will. We will.

301
0:29:51,760 --> 0:29:56,160
All right. A couple of email. Tarrin writes, hello, I work at a big academic

302
0:29:56,160 --> 0:30:03,520
hospital. I'm almost 14 days post second Pfizer vaccine. Our hospital uses Abbott SARS-CoVIG assay.

303
0:30:03,520 --> 0:30:08,480
A couple of my coworkers have gone to get tested, come back negative. The results specifically

304
0:30:08,480 --> 0:30:13,760
state they can't be used for vaccine efficacy verification. What can be used for that? Anything?

305
0:30:16,960 --> 0:30:20,960
So I've been telling people, just don't check your serologies. Just go ahead,

306
0:30:20,960 --> 0:30:25,040
trust the data, trust the science, trust the protection. Yeah, there is a commercially

307
0:30:25,040 --> 0:30:31,440
available neutralizing antibody assay. But again, I don't want to encourage you to do that. So yeah,

308
0:30:31,440 --> 0:30:36,400
just go ahead, get your vaccine, stop doing all the blood work. Let's focus our resources on the

309
0:30:36,400 --> 0:30:42,560
critical areas. All right. This is from Anthony. I do a live stream with Amy every Wednesday night,

310
0:30:42,560 --> 0:30:47,760
and he heard it last night. And the topic came up of taking NSAIDs after vaccination to reduce

311
0:30:47,760 --> 0:30:52,800
discomfort. If memory serves me correctly, someone even suggested taking it and over the

312
0:30:52,800 --> 0:30:58,320
counter painkiller before vaccination, someone else thought NSAIDs reduced the effectiveness

313
0:30:58,320 --> 0:31:03,440
of vaccination. What's the correct thing to do for years? I used aspirin to reduce pain so I

314
0:31:03,440 --> 0:31:07,440
could exercise more than I read that this diminished the exercise effect.

315
0:31:10,480 --> 0:31:15,440
Yeah, I get this question a lot, actually. And I'm thinking it might be like an anti-vaxxer thing.

316
0:31:16,160 --> 0:31:19,840
If you feel crummy up to the vaccine, don't take anything. It won't work. They want everyone to

317
0:31:19,840 --> 0:31:27,360
suffer a little bit more. You know, I got my second dose of vaccine on Tuesday morning.

318
0:31:27,920 --> 0:31:32,000
And I had a few side effects, right? Like at one point, I opened an email from my partner

319
0:31:32,000 --> 0:31:36,320
Nujali and I felt a little annoyed for a couple minutes. I'm sure it was the vaccine, not the

320
0:31:36,320 --> 0:31:40,560
content of the email. And then I had a meeting yesterday. It was supposed to be at four. I thought

321
0:31:40,560 --> 0:31:45,600
it was at three. So a little bit of a cognitive impact getting confused there. You know, and I

322
0:31:45,600 --> 0:31:50,160
did. I felt a little achy, actually. I mean, you know, it wasn't big. I took a couple of leave.

323
0:31:50,160 --> 0:31:54,640
I think that that's fine. I don't think there's any, you know, get Breanne Barker to jump in on this.

324
0:31:54,640 --> 0:31:59,200
But you know, if you take a couple of leave, take a couple of ad bill, you take NSAIDs. I don't

325
0:31:59,200 --> 0:32:02,640
think that that's going to prevent your B cells and T cells from doing their job. So

326
0:32:03,280 --> 0:32:09,360
not a problem from my perspective. All right. One more from Karen, whose mother in November

327
0:32:09,360 --> 0:32:16,160
contracted COVID-19. She's an assisted living facility, had a hard time, has a lot of comorbidities.

328
0:32:16,160 --> 0:32:20,800
And at one point, she decided she didn't want to eat anymore, which they took it to determine

329
0:32:20,800 --> 0:32:26,880
was her, her will not not to live. So they asked that she'd be placed in hospice care rather than

330
0:32:26,880 --> 0:32:32,800
going to the hospital. So she would like to know a little discussion of hospice or palliative care

331
0:32:32,800 --> 0:32:39,200
decisions in your clinical updates, Daniel. Sure. Sure. Actually, I appreciate that you bring

332
0:32:39,200 --> 0:32:44,000
this up. We don't talk about this or a lot or haven't talked about this. But on a daily basis,

333
0:32:44,000 --> 0:32:51,440
this is part of our our birthday. We try to get a sense of where people are headed, how they're

334
0:32:51,440 --> 0:32:55,760
going to do. And there certainly are a lot of individuals where early on we realized that

335
0:32:55,760 --> 0:33:01,440
that their chance of coming out of this in a positive way is low. And actually, you know,

336
0:33:01,440 --> 0:33:06,320
sort of a little bit of a hats off to Northwell. They actually at Plainview Hospital, where I spend

337
0:33:06,320 --> 0:33:11,680
a lot of time, they actually recruited and they have a full time palliative care specialist. And

338
0:33:11,680 --> 0:33:16,720
she and I talk quite a bit just lovely, brilliant woman. I think she speaks more languages than I

339
0:33:16,720 --> 0:33:22,800
have fingers. And we actually have specialists get involved, have conversations with the family.

340
0:33:22,800 --> 0:33:26,000
You know, what are the goals of care? What would what would your loved one want?

341
0:33:26,800 --> 0:33:30,080
Often, and it's wonderful when the loved one can be part of that decision making.

342
0:33:30,080 --> 0:33:36,640
And yeah, so this is a big part. You really you really want to have this conversation before

343
0:33:36,640 --> 0:33:41,440
someone gets sick. You want to share your your goals, your your desires with your family. I'm

344
0:33:41,440 --> 0:33:45,120
started talking to the individuals who might end up getting COVID here, which is a lot of us

345
0:33:46,240 --> 0:33:50,960
before so that when someone ends up in the hospital, you know, I actually worked with

346
0:33:50,960 --> 0:33:56,560
intending who was a physicist and he used to refer to this as the fifth vital sign. You know,

347
0:33:56,560 --> 0:34:02,640
you know, you want to know, you know, on the admission, what would this person want? What are

348
0:34:02,640 --> 0:34:08,320
their goals of care? And often people who I consult for I will often put my recommendations in,

349
0:34:08,320 --> 0:34:12,320
but then I'll also put a little tagline about, you know, these should be consistent with goals

350
0:34:12,320 --> 0:34:18,640
of care. Particularly in the surge conditions, this would come up quite a bit. Does this individual

351
0:34:18,640 --> 0:34:24,000
really want to be here in the hospital? Or is this an individual? Is this a family context where

352
0:34:24,000 --> 0:34:29,440
they would prefer to be home? They'd prefer to be in a hospice setting? And I will say, my

353
0:34:29,440 --> 0:34:35,120
stepsister is a hospice nurse. Hospice is not, ooh, someone's just about to die. It is a it is a

354
0:34:35,120 --> 0:34:40,080
change in the goals of care. And a lot of times, just to qualify a hospice, you're saying, I think

355
0:34:40,080 --> 0:34:45,440
they're less likely to live six months. So the mistake people often make when they think about

356
0:34:45,440 --> 0:34:50,480
palliative care is they wait too long to make these decisions. They wait too long to have these

357
0:34:50,480 --> 0:34:54,960
conversations. And I appreciate you bringing it up because I think this is critical. This is

358
0:34:54,960 --> 0:34:59,200
no one wants to talk about this, but everyone should talk about it so that when we get to this

359
0:34:59,200 --> 0:35:07,680
point, we know what you really want us to be doing. That's COVID-19 clinical update number 46 with

360
0:35:07,680 --> 0:35:21,840
Dr. Daniel Griffin. Thank you, Daniel. Oh, thank you so much, Vincent. And everyone, be safe.
