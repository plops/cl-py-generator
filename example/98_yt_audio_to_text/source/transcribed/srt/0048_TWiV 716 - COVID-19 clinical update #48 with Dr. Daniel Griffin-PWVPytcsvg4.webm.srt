0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:06,880
This week in virology, the podcast about viruses, the kind that make you sick.

2
0:00:10,320 --> 0:00:20,720
From Microbe TV, this is Twiv, this week in virology, episode 716, recorded on February 4,

3
0:00:20,720 --> 0:00:26,880
2021. I'm Vincent Rackeniello, and you're listening to the podcast all about viruses

4
0:00:26,880 --> 0:00:33,840
joining me today from New York, Daniel Griffin. Hello, everyone. So Daniel,

5
0:00:33,840 --> 0:00:39,440
January is over. You said it was going to be the worst January. Did that turn out to be true?

6
0:00:40,880 --> 0:00:48,000
It certainly did. The only good thing is it is now over, and we have passed my favorite day of the

7
0:00:48,000 --> 0:00:56,000
year, Groundhog Day. So it sort of means at least we could start looking forward to a better spring,

8
0:00:56,000 --> 0:01:04,240
but it's been a horrible January. I sometimes feel like we're kind of US-centric, and in the US,

9
0:01:04,240 --> 0:01:10,240
I feel like we've kind of crested or we are in the process of cresting a huge wave. The case

10
0:01:10,240 --> 0:01:16,800
numbers, I think, are coming down after the holidays, but the deaths, we're seeing the deaths from

11
0:01:16,800 --> 0:01:22,560
all those cases still. So still a lot of deaths. There's still a lot of patients in the hospital,

12
0:01:23,200 --> 0:01:27,360
but I think we have better days ahead in the US, but I'm going to make sure I hit on this.

13
0:01:27,360 --> 0:01:31,440
We can't forget about the rest of the world, because no one's safe until everyone's safe.

14
0:01:32,640 --> 0:01:40,160
Let me start with a quotation we have a lot to do today, how very little can be done under the

15
0:01:40,160 --> 0:01:49,200
spirit of fear, and that's Florence Nightingale. A couple things I really like, well, a very

16
0:01:49,200 --> 0:01:58,400
inspirational woman who really advanced nursing, but a couple of things it brings, I think,

17
0:01:58,400 --> 0:02:05,360
makes me think of. One is just how critical the nurses are in taking care of patients,

18
0:02:05,360 --> 0:02:10,880
and how critical I think they are in the culture of medicine. They bring a real warmth and a caring

19
0:02:11,440 --> 0:02:18,000
to patient care. And just this pointing out that people work better in a cooperative,

20
0:02:18,000 --> 0:02:24,560
in a supportive, in a culture of generosity and kindness. And I think in a lot of ways over the

21
0:02:24,560 --> 0:02:30,720
last year that has been forgotten, there's been a lot of rigidity and rules, and this is how we're

22
0:02:30,720 --> 0:02:38,880
doing it. I know hospitals are struggling financially, but you can't lose sight of we're not there

23
0:02:38,880 --> 0:02:45,280
primarily to make a dollar, we're there primarily to take care of people. And the almighty dollar

24
0:02:45,280 --> 0:02:52,240
has to come second to a patient's life, patient's care. So, all right, we'll start off with the

25
0:02:52,240 --> 0:02:57,280
pre-exposure period with my three rules that actually started to see these echoed a bit in

26
0:02:57,280 --> 0:03:03,520
the media, which is great. Never miss an opportunity to vaccinate, never miss an opportunity to test

27
0:03:04,080 --> 0:03:10,800
and never waste a precious vaccine dose. So, today I'm going to be talking about mutations,

28
0:03:10,800 --> 0:03:19,040
vaccines, and some anticoagulation, very exciting anticoagulation updates. So, active vaccination,

29
0:03:19,040 --> 0:03:25,600
in this realm, and it really, it goes into several of the different phases or stages of COVID-19,

30
0:03:25,600 --> 0:03:32,880
but I'm going to try to talk a little bit about these in a context that makes sense for

31
0:03:32,880 --> 0:03:37,600
clinicians. Like, what are we as clinicians? How do we understand this language and what is going

32
0:03:37,600 --> 0:03:43,360
on here? So, I'm going to hit up some important highlights, but just a little background, right?

33
0:03:43,360 --> 0:03:51,360
We are on Twiv. This is science heavy, and that is good. This is an RNA virus. So, there's going

34
0:03:51,360 --> 0:03:58,560
to be changes to the genetic code being randomly introduced when this virus replicates. An infected

35
0:03:58,560 --> 0:04:06,480
person has a large number of replicating virions. So, not every single virus in a person is exactly

36
0:04:06,480 --> 0:04:12,880
the same. Sort of a quasi-species people talk about sometimes. I know in the world of HIV.

37
0:04:14,080 --> 0:04:20,160
Now, I am going to oversimplify a little, but a change in the genetic code can be silent,

38
0:04:20,160 --> 0:04:27,920
or they can actually result in a change in amino acids for which the protein is being coded.

39
0:04:28,560 --> 0:04:35,520
I say this is simplified because RNA itself can have some functionality. So, as clinicians,

40
0:04:35,520 --> 0:04:41,760
why do we care about mutations? We all enjoy science fiction, but why do we actually care

41
0:04:41,760 --> 0:04:48,240
in our day-to-day? One is the specter that changed the genetic code of the virus. A mutation can

42
0:04:48,240 --> 0:04:54,800
make the virus more transmissible. We want to give that just a little bit of context. It's not as

43
0:04:54,800 --> 0:04:59,440
though the change in the genetic code makes the virus fly through the air more quickly. Nothing

44
0:04:59,440 --> 0:05:06,720
like that. But maybe I think as Anthony Fauci said in his first, we'll call it, the Post-Trump

45
0:05:06,720 --> 0:05:14,160
Giddy news conference, it could affect the ability of the virus to bind tightly to its target receptor

46
0:05:14,160 --> 0:05:21,920
to the ACE2 receptor. So, it might be more transmissible in that it's easier for a smaller exposure

47
0:05:21,920 --> 0:05:28,480
to result in an infection. It could potentially change the virulence. It could either make the

48
0:05:28,480 --> 0:05:36,400
virus more or less virulent. And then as clinicians, a big one for us is, are these changes going to

49
0:05:36,400 --> 0:05:42,240
impact our therapeutics or the immune response? So, is it going to affect, for instance, our drugs,

50
0:05:42,240 --> 0:05:50,320
our monoclonal therapies, or our vaccines? So, just to give people a little bit of language here,

51
0:05:50,320 --> 0:05:57,440
so the changes we care about are mutations or deletions. These are inevitable, right?

52
0:05:57,440 --> 0:06:04,000
Variants are thus expected, but it's really the biologically significant changes that we care

53
0:06:04,000 --> 0:06:08,880
about. So, for each variant of concern, we can ask this question about the genetic changes,

54
0:06:08,880 --> 0:06:14,800
the mutations, the deletions, potentially even some additions, but we won't really go into that

55
0:06:14,800 --> 0:06:19,200
today. But most of the changes, I'm going to, actually all the changes I'm going to talk about

56
0:06:19,200 --> 0:06:26,240
today, are going to affect the biology of the spike protein, right? So, just a little bit

57
0:06:26,240 --> 0:06:30,720
about the spike protein. I always try to use visuals to get people to think about this,

58
0:06:30,720 --> 0:06:38,480
and sometimes my visuals are more of the cartoony, but the spike protein is a protein. It's made up

59
0:06:38,480 --> 0:06:44,960
of amino acids, right? Amino acids come together and make a protein. This protein is 1,273 amino acids

60
0:06:44,960 --> 0:06:54,160
long. In general, we'll say the Wuhan reference strain, but that spike protein is for clinicians

61
0:06:54,160 --> 0:07:00,000
to really kind of put this in your mind in a terminology you can remember on the fly.

62
0:07:00,000 --> 0:07:04,080
There's really two important parts of that spike protein that we're going to talk about.

63
0:07:04,080 --> 0:07:10,560
The N-terminal domain, the NTD, it's not neglected tropical disease, and the receptor binding domain,

64
0:07:10,560 --> 0:07:15,920
the RBD. I'm going to ignore some of the others just for simplicity because there's a lot of

65
0:07:15,920 --> 0:07:20,880
complexity here. There's areas where this could be broken down, cleaved proteases, the rest,

66
0:07:20,880 --> 0:07:29,200
but just for today, the NTD, the N-terminal domain, and the RBD. I want people to think

67
0:07:29,200 --> 0:07:33,520
about this as the analogy of a hand, and we're going to get back into that, the hand and the arm.

68
0:07:34,560 --> 0:07:38,880
But just some of the terminology, what are these crazy numbers and letters, right? I know we've

69
0:07:38,880 --> 0:07:44,240
been told don't call it the UK strain. Don't call it the South African strain, so people have now

70
0:07:44,240 --> 0:07:50,480
thrown in the numbers and said originally isolated in the UK. So I'm going to acknowledge that.

71
0:07:51,040 --> 0:07:57,120
So as I mentioned, the spike protein is 1,273 amino acids long. Don't tune out. It's going to be

72
0:07:57,120 --> 0:08:01,360
OK. You're going to make it through. This is critical stuff to know. And what are those numbers?

73
0:08:01,360 --> 0:08:06,240
The numbers start with the N-terminal domain. That's where one is. And at the far right,

74
0:08:06,240 --> 0:08:12,240
think of this in your head. That's going to be 1273. The deletions are going to be the same thing.

75
0:08:12,240 --> 0:08:17,680
So when we hear a number, we're talking about a particular amino acid that has changed.

76
0:08:17,680 --> 0:08:21,520
So when you talk about, I'm going to give some concrete examples. When you talk about an N

77
0:08:21,520 --> 0:08:31,040
501Y, that means we're talking about a change, an amino acid 501, and the N has changed to a Y.

78
0:08:31,040 --> 0:08:37,760
Well, what is an N? I mean, an N is a code. Help us, you know, use a one letter code for

79
0:08:37,760 --> 0:08:45,440
our amino acid. So an N is an S-bar gene. A T is a tyrosine. And so the N goes to the Y.

80
0:08:45,440 --> 0:08:49,840
I have to look those up. I'll be honest. But just let people kind of get a sense here. When you

81
0:08:49,840 --> 0:08:58,720
hear an N 501Y, when you hear an E or 84K, that's 484. The E has changed to a K. So we'll talk a

82
0:08:58,720 --> 0:09:04,160
little bit about this. If you hear deletion, deletion 69 test 70, that's going to mean those

83
0:09:04,160 --> 0:09:10,240
amino acid 6970 were deleted, right? So a little trick here to help people just think,

84
0:09:10,240 --> 0:09:16,240
because this is going to become a number soup going forward, right? Every one of those 1273

85
0:09:16,240 --> 0:09:22,720
amino acids can change or be deleted. The N terminal domain that goes from about 14 to 306.

86
0:09:23,280 --> 0:09:28,640
And the RBD, you could use the palm of my hand analogy, the RBD, the receptor body domain that

87
0:09:28,640 --> 0:09:36,800
grabs onto spike is 330 to 528. So 331 to 528 to be exact. So anything that affects the palm of

88
0:09:36,800 --> 0:09:41,360
the hand is going to affect the ability of the spike to grab its receptor. And I'm going to say

89
0:09:41,360 --> 0:09:45,520
the NTD, think of that as affecting the back of the hand. It's not right in the binding pocket,

90
0:09:45,520 --> 0:09:51,200
but it may affect the modality of the binding pocket. So hopefully this allows people to

91
0:09:51,200 --> 0:09:56,480
get a little sense. So what are these numbers? What are these letters soup? So let's just talk a

92
0:09:56,480 --> 0:10:01,840
little bit about each of the described strains. So today I'm going to talk briefly to where we're

93
0:10:01,840 --> 0:10:09,600
going to go to other stuff about the B117 strain, originally described in the UK. The B135 strain

94
0:10:09,600 --> 0:10:16,640
described originally in South Africa. The Cal-20C that we're seeing out in California and the B128

95
0:10:16,640 --> 0:10:23,040
detected in Brazil, then Japan. Variants, Daniel, variants. And I call them variants or strains.

96
0:10:23,040 --> 0:10:25,440
Variants. That's the variants of concern, remember?

97
0:10:26,320 --> 0:10:31,520
So let's talk about that. This is great because clinicians, what variant versus strain? What is

98
0:10:31,520 --> 0:10:36,320
the difference? And the difference, and this is why this is this weekend virology, and we have

99
0:10:36,320 --> 0:10:45,360
Vincent chaperoning. A strain is when we have convincing biological activity change. A variant

100
0:10:45,360 --> 0:10:50,240
is when we have a change in the genetic sequence, right? So calling something a strain requires a

101
0:10:50,240 --> 0:10:57,520
higher bar. So the B117, I will use variant of concern here, originally described in the UK.

102
0:10:58,560 --> 0:11:04,400
It has that D614G that we've been hearing about for a while. It's got a couple deletions,

103
0:11:04,400 --> 0:11:14,320
and it has the N501Y, which is suggested to maybe allow that spike to bind better, right?

104
0:11:15,680 --> 0:11:23,680
The B135 variant of concern, originally described in South Africa. This has that D614G also,

105
0:11:23,680 --> 0:11:31,200
but it's also got the E484K. Now, why do we care about that as clinicians?

106
0:11:31,200 --> 0:11:36,880
We care because there is some experimental evidence suggesting that that may affect our

107
0:11:36,880 --> 0:11:42,240
monoclonal antibodies, a couple of them, so the BAM-lineva-mab and the IM-deva-mab.

108
0:11:43,360 --> 0:11:50,880
There's also a K417N in this variant of concern that we are concerned may decrease the monoclonal

109
0:11:51,840 --> 0:11:59,360
Casariva-mab efficacy, and this also has that N501Y, which we think may allow it to bind a

110
0:11:59,360 --> 0:12:09,600
little bit better. Cal20C, that's got this L452R, which we also think decreases the efficacy of our

111
0:12:09,600 --> 0:12:15,360
BAM-BAM, and also may be associated with decreased plasma effects. So maybe there's some

112
0:12:16,880 --> 0:12:21,360
impact upon someone who's been previously infected, and I'm just going to mention the

113
0:12:21,360 --> 0:12:25,120
Brazil one last, and then just kind of try to put this all together for people in a way that

114
0:12:25,120 --> 0:12:34,720
they can think about it. So the B128 detected in Brazil, then Japan, that has the E484,

115
0:12:34,720 --> 0:12:41,120
which we talked about, it has the N501Y. Now, just to put this in people's mind, you're going to

116
0:12:41,120 --> 0:12:45,120
hear all these numbers. So one of the things you could do is when you hear the numbers say,

117
0:12:45,120 --> 0:12:50,160
okay, is that somewhere in that 331 to 520? Is that affecting the palm of the hand? Might that

118
0:12:50,160 --> 0:12:56,640
affect the ability of the spike protein to bind to the receptor? And if it does, this is a sweet

119
0:12:56,640 --> 0:13:02,720
spot we think for neutralizing antibodies, so it may potentially impact some of our monoclonals.

120
0:13:03,600 --> 0:13:09,920
But I do want to say this guy is not falling. As people may know, I mentioned several times,

121
0:13:09,920 --> 0:13:16,000
I'm involved with Eli Lilly and helping get their monoclonal antibodies to folks and trials,

122
0:13:16,000 --> 0:13:21,440
also with Regeneron as well. I guess the caveat with that, they don't give me any money, but

123
0:13:22,640 --> 0:13:28,400
happier with that. Maybe it would be a conflict of interest if they did. But we follow these

124
0:13:28,400 --> 0:13:33,600
because we are concerned, but the other side is they have a lot of monoclonal antibodies in the

125
0:13:33,600 --> 0:13:39,520
pipeline. So ones that can cover these. So if you're in an area where you're concerned about

126
0:13:39,520 --> 0:13:46,320
bamelinibimab efficacy, Eli Lilly has data as we talked about on a cocktail. There's also the

127
0:13:46,320 --> 0:13:51,760
Regeneron cocktail. If you're concerned about the Regeneron cocktail the other way, and then there

128
0:13:51,760 --> 0:14:01,360
are other monoclonal antibodies in the pipeline, so to speak. So I envision some point, Vincent

129
0:14:01,360 --> 0:14:06,240
in the future, this will be on my board exam where they'll have these up there posted, and I'll

130
0:14:06,240 --> 0:14:12,960
have to remember which one just like I have to with the HIV mutations and which drugs I can and

131
0:14:12,960 --> 0:14:22,640
can't use. So I'm working on some kind of memory tricks, the Nervous Nelly 501Y. That was the one

132
0:14:22,640 --> 0:14:29,680
in the UK. The EEC 484K, am I really worried about that affecting my monoclonal bamelinibimab

133
0:14:29,680 --> 0:14:37,680
and imdabimab? That lousy 452, does that affect my bamelinibimab? The kite 417N, so that's the

134
0:14:37,680 --> 0:14:45,120
k417N slash t, is that can affect Cassie? So I think as time goes by, we'll get a better sense of

135
0:14:45,120 --> 0:14:50,240
where all these come out. But there was a really nice paper out of the David Holab,

136
0:14:50,240 --> 0:14:58,240
increased resistance of SARS-CoV-2 variants, B1351 and B117 to antibody neutralization.

137
0:14:58,240 --> 0:15:06,080
And a lot of things described here, you have to use more codvalescent plasma, about 11 or 33

138
0:15:06,080 --> 0:15:13,600
fold increase for neutralization with codvalescent plasma, about a 6.5 to 8.6 fold increase in

139
0:15:13,600 --> 0:15:20,160
vaccine sera. But from a clinical standpoint, I mentioned I don't think the sky is falling.

140
0:15:20,160 --> 0:15:28,960
On a positive note, we have various monoclonals that are already FDA-UA, so emergency use

141
0:15:28,960 --> 0:15:34,320
authorized out there that we can use. We have others in the pipeline waiting to go

142
0:15:34,960 --> 0:15:41,120
hopefully quickly through the FDA if needed. And this is something I think that we can stay

143
0:15:41,120 --> 0:15:47,600
ahead of. So I'm not concerned that the sky is falling. So if that decreases our number of

144
0:15:47,600 --> 0:15:52,320
Twiv listeners, because I'm not saying the sky is falling and saying stay tuned for exciting news,

145
0:15:53,040 --> 0:15:57,760
I just want to be honest and reassuring. As a clinician, I think that we have the tools and

146
0:15:57,760 --> 0:16:02,240
the technology to stay ahead of these things. Do you have any comments, Vincent? Do you think

147
0:16:02,240 --> 0:16:08,000
the sky is falling or does it seem reasonable? No, I don't. And we've talked about this a lot

148
0:16:08,400 --> 0:16:15,920
on Twiv and I don't want to usurp you. Please usurp. I think that the benefit of this is having

149
0:16:15,920 --> 0:16:25,200
you as well. So jump in. So originally, the B117 variant, which originated in the UK,

150
0:16:25,200 --> 0:16:32,240
originally said, oh, it's 50% more transmissible. But you know what? Since then, it's gone to many

151
0:16:32,240 --> 0:16:40,560
other places and it's not doing 50% more transmissible. So it's a lot more subtle. It's a lot more nuanced

152
0:16:40,560 --> 0:16:46,880
than just transmission. And I like to think of it as these changes affecting fitness.

153
0:16:47,520 --> 0:16:53,360
Fitness is the ability of a virus to get to a new host. And it doesn't just

154
0:16:53,360 --> 0:17:00,080
involve going through the air. It involves the amount of virus shed by someone, the ability of

155
0:17:00,080 --> 0:17:06,640
the virus to take hold in the host, maybe to evade immune responses, maybe to reproduce better.

156
0:17:06,640 --> 0:17:11,920
So I think sometimes these changes give the virus a little edge and it takes off, but it's not

157
0:17:11,920 --> 0:17:18,720
really transmitting better. It's just spreading and displacing another virus in the population.

158
0:17:18,720 --> 0:17:25,840
So that whole idea doesn't bother me. I think a more realistic concern is the change are the

159
0:17:25,840 --> 0:17:32,800
changes that can abrogate monoclonal effectiveness and vaccine effectiveness, as you've talked about.

160
0:17:32,800 --> 0:17:39,520
Because if you do your masking and distancing and all that, it doesn't matter, except for the

161
0:17:39,520 --> 0:17:43,280
antibody resolving an infection. So that's my take on this.

162
0:17:43,280 --> 0:17:49,600
And I think I get questions and I don't know if this will be guitar to throw people out. Oh, my

163
0:17:49,600 --> 0:17:56,240
gosh, with these new variants, do they hear they go right through the masks? No, I think a lot of

164
0:17:56,240 --> 0:18:02,000
people's perception is when they say, oh, increased transmissibility or increased transmission,

165
0:18:02,000 --> 0:18:06,640
they view it as almost like a bullet. And then someone cough their sneezes and these have somehow

166
0:18:06,640 --> 0:18:13,200
changed their shape and can penetrate the fibers of your mask. And you now have to use keglar masks.

167
0:18:13,200 --> 0:18:17,520
I mean, I think, you know, time will tell, right? I mean, you and I are being recorded.

168
0:18:17,520 --> 0:18:23,040
So in March, right, people will go back to these episodes and sort of get a better sense.

169
0:18:24,000 --> 0:18:30,320
Well, you know, the 117 variant is in many other countries. And in Scotland,

170
0:18:30,320 --> 0:18:33,520
it hasn't taken off in California. It's been there since November.

171
0:18:33,520 --> 0:18:39,120
It has not displaced the existing variants. So something else is going on.

172
0:18:39,120 --> 0:18:43,680
It's not just about going through those droplets. That's what I want people to understand.

173
0:18:44,640 --> 0:18:49,760
Yeah, it's complicated. But I think the great thing is we have the science and the scientists

174
0:18:49,760 --> 0:18:54,480
who are on top of this. And so we're going to get out of this. We are not going to have

175
0:18:54,480 --> 0:19:01,760
another January like we just had, but Nick five. So in the Lancet, we got safety and efficacy of an

176
0:19:02,800 --> 0:19:10,560
R add 26 and an R add five vector based heterologous prime boost COVID-19 vaccine.

177
0:19:10,560 --> 0:19:14,880
An interim analysis of randomized controlled phase three trial in Russia.

178
0:19:15,680 --> 0:19:21,200
So these were the results that we were waiting for randomized double blind placebo controlled

179
0:19:21,200 --> 0:19:26,560
phase three trial in 25 hospitals and polyclinics in Moscow, Russia.

180
0:19:27,920 --> 0:19:36,800
And so this vaccine group and of one of 16,501 placebo group was smaller 5,476.

181
0:19:36,800 --> 0:19:42,240
And then the numbers don't quite add up because they say 19,866 received two doses

182
0:19:42,240 --> 0:19:47,200
of vaccine or placebo. So there was a little bit of a you lose a few folks there between

183
0:19:47,200 --> 0:19:54,240
the whole trial and everyone getting that boost. But from 21 days, and this was interesting,

184
0:19:54,800 --> 0:20:00,160
from 21 days after the first dose. So that basically started counting the day people came in for

185
0:20:00,160 --> 0:20:10,160
their second dose or booster. They saw that 0.1% of the vaccinated got COVID-19. 1.3% in the placebo

186
0:20:10,160 --> 0:20:15,520
group, right? These are small numbers, but that gives us an efficacy about 91.6. And they've got

187
0:20:15,520 --> 0:20:20,880
another one of these. These will be the curves that I've heard are now on T-shirts, immunity works.

188
0:20:21,520 --> 0:20:26,400
We show the placebo group in red and just the number of confirmed COVID-19 just keeps going,

189
0:20:26,400 --> 0:20:31,680
keeps going where the vaccine it goes up. And then once they've reached a level of protection,

190
0:20:31,680 --> 0:20:37,680
it sort of levels out and stays pretty flat for a while. With the data here, they have actually

191
0:20:37,680 --> 0:20:42,480
mentioned that they're going to do a single dose trial, which will be interesting as well.

192
0:20:42,480 --> 0:20:49,280
And it's been some discussion on the main this weekend virology about some of the other data.

193
0:20:50,000 --> 0:20:57,520
So more exciting news on vaccines. But let me hit a bunch of Q&A questions and answers on vaccines.

194
0:20:58,080 --> 0:21:01,600
This is actually, I spend a lot of my time talking to a new Julie, my partner today,

195
0:21:01,600 --> 0:21:05,520
and she's saying, what are we going to do when COVID is over? Because we spend so much of our time

196
0:21:05,520 --> 0:21:10,160
addressing COVID-related questions and vaccine questions. So if the vaccine still allow

197
0:21:10,160 --> 0:21:17,760
for milder symptomatic COVID mainly prevents severe COVID, what about getting a mild case

198
0:21:17,760 --> 0:21:24,160
and the risk of developing long COVID? So that's an interesting question. Just to be honest,

199
0:21:24,160 --> 0:21:30,160
we do not know. But this is a very interesting question. If a person has been vaccinated,

200
0:21:30,160 --> 0:21:36,000
they go ahead and get a mild case of COVID. We are hoping they're less likely to develop the

201
0:21:36,000 --> 0:21:41,200
long COVID, but we still don't know. And actually, this is a pretty important question, I would say.

202
0:21:42,160 --> 0:21:47,360
As I get into some of the other questions, I will say I'm optimistic about this.

203
0:21:47,360 --> 0:21:52,880
It looks like when people do get infected, the limited data we have that they end up with milder

204
0:21:52,880 --> 0:21:56,880
symptoms, they end up with a shorter course, they end up with a shorter period of time that

205
0:21:56,880 --> 0:22:03,440
they're actually shedding the virus. Or I should say that their RNA PCR positive, they also end up

206
0:22:03,440 --> 0:22:09,760
at much lower, usually about two logs lower. So I'm optimistic, but yeah, I think that this is a

207
0:22:09,760 --> 0:22:15,600
question that we'll keep our eye on. It sort of goes right into this next one. Any more information

208
0:22:15,600 --> 0:22:22,560
on vaccinated people being less able to transmit the virus, right? This gets back to sort of Dixon's

209
0:22:22,560 --> 0:22:27,040
idea that he doesn't want a healthcare worker coming and taking care of him, who's not vaccinated

210
0:22:27,040 --> 0:22:31,920
because now they're more likely to give him the virus. So I always like to use scenarios,

211
0:22:31,920 --> 0:22:37,360
and I get a lot of questions here about scenarios. So we have some adults, right? Over the age of 75,

212
0:22:37,360 --> 0:22:42,720
they're about to get their second dose. And they're already starting to ask, well, now that I have

213
0:22:42,720 --> 0:22:49,120
my second dose, what can I do? Can I go visit my friends in Florida? They've also been vaccinated.

214
0:22:49,680 --> 0:22:56,400
Can I fly to go visit my adult children? What about all the other activities? So

215
0:22:56,400 --> 0:23:02,800
just want to bring up some more data we have here. So analysis of PCR positive swabs in the UK

216
0:23:02,800 --> 0:23:09,840
population, right? Suggesting that the vaccine may reduce transmission, but we'll get a little bit

217
0:23:09,840 --> 0:23:15,840
farther into that because I want to hit on some really sort of specific scenarios. Anything new

218
0:23:15,840 --> 0:23:22,000
about people who previously had COVID getting vaccinated, right? And Peter Hotez weighed in on

219
0:23:22,000 --> 0:23:29,600
this, but there's some research. We've got some papers out. Robust spike antibody one responses

220
0:23:29,600 --> 0:23:37,040
and increased reactogenicity in seropositive individuals after a single dose of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA

221
0:23:37,040 --> 0:23:41,760
vaccine. This was out of Mount Sinai. And they actually found, and this is something I think

222
0:23:41,760 --> 0:23:46,720
we're starting to see, and now it's nice to have it quantified, they found that getting that first

223
0:23:46,720 --> 0:23:53,360
vaccine dose in someone who had COVID before was very similar to that second dose in folks who

224
0:23:53,360 --> 0:24:00,880
did not have COVID before. So similar reactogenicity profile, but also what looks like a similar

225
0:24:00,880 --> 0:24:06,480
boost in the antibody levels. What we don't know, and we're not going to know quite yet, right,

226
0:24:06,480 --> 0:24:12,560
is what's the durability? What are the kinetics of those antibody responses? The other paper,

227
0:24:12,560 --> 0:24:18,240
single dose vaccination in healthcare workers previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. This is out

228
0:24:18,240 --> 0:24:23,280
of University of Maryland. And they really, really found about the same thing. It looked like

229
0:24:24,000 --> 0:24:31,040
that one dose of the mRNA vaccine was giving these elevated antibody titers, similar to sort of the

230
0:24:31,040 --> 0:24:36,720
boost we would expect from a second. So we're not encouraging people at this point to only get

231
0:24:36,720 --> 0:24:42,080
one shot. We may actually end up at some point having people get even a third shot. Who knows?

232
0:24:42,880 --> 0:24:49,280
But this is interesting stuff and is helpful. We're learning more. And I think it does feed to

233
0:24:49,280 --> 0:24:55,120
boy, if you've had COVID before that first shot, maybe a bit of a doozy, maybe what most people

234
0:24:55,120 --> 0:24:59,440
are getting the second time. I don't know why I still get this question, but is it a good idea to

235
0:24:59,440 --> 0:25:04,800
keep millions of vaccine doses in the freezers to make sure that second dose is given right on

236
0:25:04,800 --> 0:25:10,560
schedule? Well, unfortunately, I think everyone is aware that millions of doses of vaccines are

237
0:25:10,560 --> 0:25:16,000
sitting in freezers and not getting into people's arms here in the US. And despite requests by the

238
0:25:16,000 --> 0:25:22,640
White House, by Andy Slavitt, to those vaccines in arms, many large hospital systems have freezers

239
0:25:22,640 --> 0:25:27,280
full of doses. Oddly enough, some rules only allow for vaccines to go to sites that have the ability

240
0:25:27,280 --> 0:25:33,760
to have those freezers. In my world, you wouldn't be allowed to have vaccines if you had a freezer

241
0:25:33,760 --> 0:25:39,920
that could hang on to them for more than those 30 days. Now, the CDC has updated their guidance on

242
0:25:39,920 --> 0:25:47,360
COVID mRNA vaccine interim dosing to include a grace period. So you can get it four days earlier

243
0:25:47,360 --> 0:25:54,720
than the three or four weeks. And then they serve statement, then out to six weeks, if it is not

244
0:25:54,720 --> 0:25:59,440
feasible to adhere to the recommended interval. So they, they'll give the qualified statement

245
0:25:59,440 --> 0:26:04,480
just to quote right off. CDC is not advocating for people to delay getting their second dose.

246
0:26:05,200 --> 0:26:11,600
But the data from clinical trial supports this range of either four days early or out to six weeks

247
0:26:11,600 --> 0:26:18,400
if you need to. So my answer really is in line with the Biden COVID task force that no, it is not

248
0:26:18,400 --> 0:26:25,600
a good idea to remove two fifths of the available vaccine doses from potentially giving those people

249
0:26:25,600 --> 0:26:29,840
freeze them away just because you want to hedge and are worried that there might be a slight

250
0:26:29,840 --> 0:26:34,800
delay of a few in the order of days of getting the second vaccine doses into patients. So

251
0:26:34,800 --> 0:26:38,160
I think people have probably heard how we've approached this at pro health. When we get our

252
0:26:38,160 --> 0:26:44,880
vaccines, we put them 100% of those and up in arms as soon as possible. So if everyone would do that,

253
0:26:44,880 --> 0:26:51,200
I think that this would go much quicker. Is the supply now flowing from Moderna and Pfizer or

254
0:26:51,200 --> 0:27:00,000
is it jerky? The supply is flowing. We're getting 200,000 doses a week to New York.

255
0:27:00,880 --> 0:27:07,600
Some of the states have to say like our riverside partners, you know, every every week they get a

256
0:27:07,600 --> 0:27:13,840
consistent supply because there it's going directly to our to our clinics where we're giving everyone

257
0:27:13,840 --> 0:27:21,280
the vaccines. In New York, there's still this hub model where every week you put in as a provider,

258
0:27:21,280 --> 0:27:26,400
you know, we would like this many to this many sites. And even though there's a constant flow

259
0:27:26,400 --> 0:27:34,000
to the state, that flow is still going to large hospital systems, healthcare systems with lots of

260
0:27:34,000 --> 0:27:39,360
freezers. Every time one dose is given, another stuck in the freezer for, you know, three or four

261
0:27:39,360 --> 0:27:47,680
weeks later. So yeah, it's flowing. Moderna actually increased by 33%. The amount of vaccine it's

262
0:27:47,680 --> 0:27:53,360
sending out, Pfizer is increasing their production. So, you know, the government and the pharmaceutical

263
0:27:53,360 --> 0:27:58,320
companies have made it clear there is this is flowing. You know, and if somebody gets their

264
0:27:58,320 --> 0:28:04,160
dose delayed by a few days, that's not as much of an issue as, you know, millions of people

265
0:28:04,160 --> 0:28:09,760
not getting any vaccine at all here. And I guess this we're tying into the if a second dose of a

266
0:28:09,760 --> 0:28:14,640
two dose vaccine is delayed, will it be less protective? Right? Because people, I think there's two

267
0:28:14,640 --> 0:28:19,200
two things here. One is person is watching the clock. I want to get that second dose so I can

268
0:28:19,200 --> 0:28:24,480
then count the clock to when I'm, you know, at that 100% protection from severe disease. But

269
0:28:24,480 --> 0:28:30,400
there's also that concern too, is if it's delayed by a period of time, will that mean that it's less

270
0:28:30,400 --> 0:28:36,240
protective? So we are starting to get some data on that. And we had recent data from AstraZeneca

271
0:28:36,800 --> 0:28:42,720
with actually interesting up demonstrated improved efficacy with longer intervals between doses

272
0:28:42,720 --> 0:28:48,320
with higher antibodies and a broader antibody response with a boost given at 12 weeks,

273
0:28:48,320 --> 0:28:56,320
rather than six weeks, vaccine efficacy rising from 54.9% with an interval of less than six weeks

274
0:28:56,320 --> 0:29:04,560
to 82.4% when spent when spaced 12 or more weeks apart. So we still recommended hearing to the

275
0:29:04,560 --> 0:29:10,400
studied intervals. But you know, this understanding of immunology. Now we're getting data really

276
0:29:10,400 --> 0:29:14,960
goes along with what we've learned over many years with vaccine research. So certainly there's a

277
0:29:14,960 --> 0:29:20,560
critical minimal interval before the boost to allow the effector cells to mature into memory cells.

278
0:29:20,560 --> 0:29:26,400
But a slightly longer interval may be associated with a higher and broader boost of antibodies.

279
0:29:27,360 --> 0:29:32,160
And I don't know if we know enough yet as far as T cell responses, whether or not they're

280
0:29:32,160 --> 0:29:37,600
enhanced. But I think our basic understanding of immunology would suggest most of the benefit

281
0:29:37,600 --> 0:29:41,920
here if you stretch that out a little is going to be antibodies, but definitely not a diminution.

282
0:29:41,920 --> 0:29:48,960
Now that I have been vaccinated, can I do the following? So the science is developing here.

283
0:29:48,960 --> 0:29:53,840
But let me run through a few scenarios and want to be careful not to get above the science,

284
0:29:53,840 --> 0:29:59,520
but also to to be reasonable in what we say. So I'm using my parents as an example. My parents

285
0:29:59,520 --> 0:30:06,240
will soon have reached two weeks past their second vaccination. Yesterday my wife helped my mother

286
0:30:06,240 --> 0:30:11,680
get to her second vaccination. My dad pretty much can do it all by himself. So the two of them went.

287
0:30:12,800 --> 0:30:17,440
And my mother reported a penicillin allergy. So they made her wait for a prolonged period of

288
0:30:17,440 --> 0:30:21,840
time because I don't know why, but Rachel was not very crowded. I think they said in the entire

289
0:30:21,840 --> 0:30:26,560
time they were there getting vaccinated for people got vaccinated. They were too. There were two others.

290
0:30:27,120 --> 0:30:32,880
But my dad wants to start going back to the office. So what was my advice? My mother's. He can't go

291
0:30:32,880 --> 0:30:37,280
to the office. He's going to get COVID. He's going to bring it home to me. So we had a couple

292
0:30:37,280 --> 0:30:42,960
conversations. One is, as I said to my dad, dad, you have not gone to the office in a year. You

293
0:30:42,960 --> 0:30:47,760
in two weeks will be protected. I do not have a problem with you going back to the office.

294
0:30:48,480 --> 0:30:55,520
Will he wear a mask? Will he will he be careful? Yes. And my worried he's going to bring it home

295
0:30:55,520 --> 0:31:00,480
and my mother will get COVID and die again? No. My mother has also been vaccinated. So

296
0:31:00,480 --> 0:31:06,400
let's I think I can answer very clearly here. Two older individuals both over the age of 80.

297
0:31:06,400 --> 0:31:11,200
Sorry about that, mom. You look younger and dad, you definitely look younger too. I have no problem

298
0:31:11,200 --> 0:31:17,520
as a son, as a physician, being okay with them going back to with my dad going back to the office.

299
0:31:18,480 --> 0:31:24,640
Now my mom wants us to come over the house for Sunday dinner indoors after she's been

300
0:31:24,640 --> 0:31:29,520
vaccinated for two weeks. Is that all right? Now this is a tough thing. And this gets into what

301
0:31:29,520 --> 0:31:33,520
does the science tell us? Are we underselling? Are we overselling the vaccine? My mother

302
0:31:34,160 --> 0:31:38,720
will have reached her two weeks past the second dose. My father will reach this two weeks past

303
0:31:38,720 --> 0:31:44,960
the second dose. Is it okay for my wife and I? And my oldest daughter will be off of college,

304
0:31:44,960 --> 0:31:50,160
but for my other daughter and Barnaby, Eloise and Barnaby to go over for Sunday dinner. We haven't

305
0:31:50,160 --> 0:31:54,240
had indoor dinner with them in a long time. Is it okay for the five of us to eat indoors?

306
0:31:54,960 --> 0:31:59,520
I'm going to say I think it's okay. I mean, I worry about my mom. I worry about my dad,

307
0:31:59,520 --> 0:32:04,720
but they've now been fully vaccinated. My dad's going to and from work, and that's it. He's,

308
0:32:04,720 --> 0:32:09,840
you know, he and my mom are not suddenly socializing with big maskless parties. I'm sure it'll be

309
0:32:09,840 --> 0:32:15,440
just the two of them watching the Super Bowl this weekend. So yeah, I think it's okay. Until they

310
0:32:15,440 --> 0:32:20,320
reach that point, though, I do not go into their house without a mask. And even if I do go in with

311
0:32:20,320 --> 0:32:26,000
the mask, I stay for limited periods of time. Now my in-laws, when they are fully vaccinated,

312
0:32:26,000 --> 0:32:29,360
they want to start flying around the country, right? They've been, they've been up in Cape

313
0:32:29,360 --> 0:32:34,960
Cods, you know, being really careful, staying by themselves. They want to start, they want to fly

314
0:32:34,960 --> 0:32:39,680
down to Florida. They want to see their vaccinated friends there. They want to fly out to Utah to

315
0:32:39,680 --> 0:32:45,760
see their, their daughter is that safe for them. Yes. And I actually think if they're flying down to

316
0:32:45,760 --> 0:32:50,800
Florida, if they're staying at a hotel and they're going to be outdoors with friends in Florida,

317
0:32:50,800 --> 0:32:56,080
I actually, I see really minimal risk. I see that being a reasonable risk taking activity.

318
0:32:56,080 --> 0:33:02,480
When they go out to see their daughter in, in Utah, we are hoping that the data will pan out. I expect

319
0:33:02,480 --> 0:33:07,600
the data to pan out that people who are vaccinated are less likely to transmit to others, but we're

320
0:33:07,600 --> 0:33:13,840
still waiting on the science on that. So that then is going to be, you know, is it, is it a risk for

321
0:33:13,840 --> 0:33:19,200
the daughter? Is it a risk for the daughter's boyfriend? Daughter has a boyfriend? Is it a risk

322
0:33:19,200 --> 0:33:26,480
for the malamute that they have the dog? But for the vaccinated parents by vaccinated in-laws,

323
0:33:26,480 --> 0:33:30,800
they're actually going to be much safer. Passive vaccination. We just talked a little bit about

324
0:33:30,800 --> 0:33:38,720
the monoclonal. So the, the Eli Lilly product, the Regeneron cocktail, the Eli Lilly cocktail in the

325
0:33:38,720 --> 0:33:45,440
past, monoclonal are still being underutilized. But as I mentioned, they're ready to go. They're

326
0:33:45,440 --> 0:33:50,800
here to meet the challenge of any changes in the genetic code of the virus. All right. So now

327
0:33:50,800 --> 0:33:56,800
this is the bulk, as though we haven't already done the bulk, lots on anticoagulation this week.

328
0:33:56,800 --> 0:34:01,280
So I don't want to keep this too long, but let's hit this. This is really critical because now we

329
0:34:01,280 --> 0:34:05,840
have new information that is actually changing some of the decisions that I'm making and some of

330
0:34:05,840 --> 0:34:11,920
the recommendations I'm making in the hospital. So based on the interim results of more than a

331
0:34:11,920 --> 0:34:18,480
thousand patients admitted to the hospital, findings from three large randomized control trials showed

332
0:34:18,480 --> 0:34:23,840
that full doses of blood thinners, in addition to being safe, were superior to the doses

333
0:34:23,840 --> 0:34:30,080
normally given to prevent blood clots in hospitalized patients with moderately severe COVID-19. So

334
0:34:30,080 --> 0:34:36,720
these trials complement the findings announced in December that the routine use of full dose

335
0:34:36,720 --> 0:34:43,440
anticoagulation when started in the ICU in critically ill COVID-19 patients was not beneficial and

336
0:34:43,440 --> 0:34:48,480
may be harmful. So just to break this down before I go through the weeds, your critically ill patient

337
0:34:48,480 --> 0:34:55,040
in the ICU with lots of lines, severely ill, the evidence that we have to date is favoring

338
0:34:55,040 --> 0:35:00,400
prophylactic dosing. It doesn't really necessarily go along with what we were thinking, but your

339
0:35:00,400 --> 0:35:08,320
floor patient who's maybe laying there in bed who's on oxygen, they actually are at lower risk of

340
0:35:08,320 --> 0:35:14,000
bleeding and they actually do better with full dose anticoagulation. So how does this fit in with

341
0:35:14,000 --> 0:35:19,040
our guidelines and how do we move forward and what are the actual studies? So the current guidelines

342
0:35:19,040 --> 0:35:25,040
from the American Society of Humanology are the ash guideline panel suggests using these were made

343
0:35:25,040 --> 0:35:30,880
a while back prophylactic intensity over intermediate or therapeutic intensity anticoagulation in

344
0:35:30,880 --> 0:35:37,280
patients with COVID-19 related acute illness who do not have suspected or confirmed VTE.

345
0:35:38,080 --> 0:35:42,080
And then we mentioned this is a conditional recommendation based on very low certainty

346
0:35:42,080 --> 0:35:47,520
in the evidence about effects. And then added to this, the panel acknowledges that higher

347
0:35:47,520 --> 0:35:53,200
intensity anticoagulation may be preferred in patients judged to be at high thrombotic risk

348
0:35:53,200 --> 0:35:59,040
and low risk of bleeding. And then we actually add the interim data from these studies will

349
0:35:59,040 --> 0:36:04,160
eventually be available in peer reviewed articles, but right now let me run through all the data

350
0:36:04,160 --> 0:36:10,720
here. So the three clinical trial platforms spanned five continents, more than 300 hospitals

351
0:36:11,760 --> 0:36:16,080
together were able to test whether there was a greater benefit of full doses of blood thinners

352
0:36:16,720 --> 0:36:22,640
to moderately ill hospitalized patients with COVID-19 compared to the lower dose typically

353
0:36:22,640 --> 0:36:28,800
administered to prevent blood clots in hospitalized patients. So let's go through the studies.

354
0:36:28,800 --> 0:36:35,680
We have the ATT ACC. This is the anti-thrombotics inpatient and anti-thrombotic therapy

355
0:36:35,680 --> 0:36:42,960
to emulate complications of COVID-19 with 58 sites in Canada, the US, Brazil and Mexico.

356
0:36:42,960 --> 0:36:50,320
We have active for a therapeutic anticoagulation accelerating COVID-19 therapeutic interventions

357
0:36:50,320 --> 0:36:57,760
and vaccines for, and this was 60 sites in USA in Spain. And we have RamCap,

358
0:36:57,760 --> 0:37:03,200
randomized embedded multi-factorial adaptive platform trial for community acquired pneumonia,

359
0:37:03,200 --> 0:37:12,960
209 sites, 290 sites. So this is very robust in Canada, the USA, UK, Ireland, EU, Saudi Arabia,

360
0:37:12,960 --> 0:37:19,600
Australia, New Zealand, Nepal, India, Pakistan. And this, I have to say this is impressive.

361
0:37:19,600 --> 0:37:25,520
There was a collaboration between all these studies and they agreed to create a multi-platform

362
0:37:25,520 --> 0:37:30,400
randomized controlled trials with harmonized protocols. So they all agreed to use common

363
0:37:30,400 --> 0:37:36,640
primary, common secondary and safety outcomes, and also to have common combined prospective

364
0:37:36,640 --> 0:37:44,320
superiority and futility rules. So all the enrollees in all sites had to have signed in symptoms

365
0:37:44,320 --> 0:37:50,800
consistent with COVID-19. So this is all symptomatic COVID-19. And then they were randomized within

366
0:37:50,800 --> 0:37:57,200
72 hours of admission. And the primary outcome was organ support free days. And then they had

367
0:37:57,200 --> 0:38:01,600
several key secondary outcomes. So from the safety, they were looking at major bleeding.

368
0:38:02,560 --> 0:38:08,400
From efficacy, they were looking at mortality, intubation, major thrombosis, stroke,

369
0:38:08,400 --> 0:38:12,480
am I, length of stay in the ICU and hospital. And then this is critical because I'm going

370
0:38:12,480 --> 0:38:16,800
to get back to this. They risk stratified. They thought they were risk stratifying people based

371
0:38:16,800 --> 0:38:23,120
upon the D dimer level. So you looked at people with D dimers that were low, less than two times

372
0:38:23,120 --> 0:38:28,320
the upper limb abnormal. And then they looked at people that had elevated D dimer, so greater

373
0:38:28,320 --> 0:38:34,640
than two times the upper limb abnormal. The reason I want to point this out right here is that this

374
0:38:34,640 --> 0:38:38,720
did not impact the recommendations. And I'm going to have to say this several times because people,

375
0:38:38,720 --> 0:38:43,200
it's very hard to get away from this. We as clinicians, we love to measure stuff. We love to have

376
0:38:43,200 --> 0:38:48,800
something objective to guide us. We think of D dimer as an indication of people developing

377
0:38:48,800 --> 0:38:54,560
thrombotic complication. And I just want to point out here, whether the D dimer was low or high,

378
0:38:54,560 --> 0:39:01,040
the recommendations still stand. And when you put all this together, the primary outcome

379
0:39:01,040 --> 0:39:07,040
of organ free support days favored full dose anticoagulation for moderate COVID-19.

380
0:39:07,040 --> 0:39:13,520
As far as secondary outcomes, mortality was lower with full dose anticoagulation for moderate

381
0:39:13,520 --> 0:39:19,840
COVID-19. Major bleeding was seen with full dose anticoagulation, but was less than 2%.

382
0:39:20,640 --> 0:39:26,640
Thrombotic events were less common with full dose anticoagulation. But to recap the other side,

383
0:39:26,640 --> 0:39:33,440
persevere COVID-19, those patients requiring ICU level support. The probability that routine use

384
0:39:33,440 --> 0:39:40,080
of therapeutic anticoagulation was inferior was 98.5%, mainly you were seeing major bleeding

385
0:39:40,080 --> 0:39:47,680
complications of 3.7% in the ICU patients, which really sort of backfired against us with that

386
0:39:47,680 --> 0:39:52,240
full dose anticoagulation. So your floor patients, the science currently suggests full dose.

387
0:39:53,280 --> 0:39:57,280
But if you're in the ICU, you want to watch the bleeding complications. I know we're going to

388
0:39:57,280 --> 0:40:01,520
probably getting near our limit here, but I sort of want to make sure I discuss guidelines and what

389
0:40:01,520 --> 0:40:06,160
they are, because we had a lot of conversation about this the last time at the Ash guideline

390
0:40:06,160 --> 0:40:12,240
meeting. And what we were discussing is we, unfortunately, people have not really understood

391
0:40:12,240 --> 0:40:16,560
what guidelines were. And guidelines have changed in the time of COVID. And I think a lot of people

392
0:40:16,560 --> 0:40:21,040
have been promoted to positions of responsibility with their force to make these decisions,

393
0:40:21,040 --> 0:40:26,320
but they themselves never served on a guideline committee before. Maybe they never helped construct

394
0:40:26,320 --> 0:40:31,920
guidelines, but now they're sort of putting these in place. And so we talked a little bit

395
0:40:31,920 --> 0:40:38,720
about how this was a challenge. So we've already added language, actually, to the Ash website,

396
0:40:39,680 --> 0:40:45,600
trying to clarify what a guideline is and how is it expected to be used. These are not rigid

397
0:40:45,600 --> 0:40:53,200
rules for patient care. And we do sort of encourage people to individualize their management decisions

398
0:40:53,200 --> 0:41:00,080
to tailor them to a specific patient. And we've added an individualized assessment of the patient's

399
0:41:00,080 --> 0:41:05,600
risk of thrombosis and bleeding is important when deciding on anticoagulation intensity.

400
0:41:06,160 --> 0:41:11,760
Clinicians should weigh the potential benefits and harms based on the most up-to-date available

401
0:41:11,760 --> 0:41:16,800
evidence in caring for their patients. So we're trying to communicate that these are

402
0:41:16,800 --> 0:41:21,840
only guidelines. They're established to help direct physicians to deliver the best care

403
0:41:21,840 --> 0:41:27,680
for their patients. And even though these are living documents updated on a regular basis,

404
0:41:27,680 --> 0:41:33,600
by their very nature, they will not be the most up-to-date based upon available evidence.

405
0:41:34,400 --> 0:41:40,000
So I'm just going to hit three sort of scenario cases, examples. Case one, just sort of what would

406
0:41:40,000 --> 0:41:47,360
we do. This is a police officer in his 40s. His oxygen saturation is 88% on room air. He has no

407
0:41:47,360 --> 0:41:52,560
significant medical problems. He's standing up. He's looking out the window. When can I go?

408
0:41:52,560 --> 0:41:57,360
He's being treated with remdesivir and steroids. That's an individual I still might stick with

409
0:41:57,360 --> 0:42:03,760
just prophylactic dosing, right? He's ambulating. He's low-risk. Case two, we have an OB, 75-year-old

410
0:42:03,760 --> 0:42:09,760
man. He's somulin. He's on six liters nasal cannula. He has coronary artery disease, CHF and diabetes.

411
0:42:10,480 --> 0:42:15,520
That's a man. Now I'm going to recommend full dose anticoagulation. Case three, a woman. She's an

412
0:42:15,520 --> 0:42:23,520
ICU. She's intubated. She's prone. She has low ematocrit. She's on medications to maintain her blood

413
0:42:23,520 --> 0:42:30,000
pressure called pressers. She has staphorus, bacteria, multiple IVs. She's got a central line.

414
0:42:30,720 --> 0:42:35,920
This is a woman that I'm going to recommend prophylactic dose anticoagulation. So I'm going

415
0:42:35,920 --> 0:42:41,120
to sort of make sure I just mentioned the tail phase, but then I'm going to update people on

416
0:42:41,120 --> 0:42:47,120
our fundraiser. So as we move into our fundraiser, I'm going to use an analogy from my honorary cousin,

417
0:42:47,120 --> 0:42:51,360
Peter Dates, about oxygen masks and airplanes. And you know how they always tell you like when

418
0:42:51,360 --> 0:42:55,840
those oxygen masks come down, put them on yourself first. But then the point I'm going to say here

419
0:42:55,840 --> 0:43:02,160
is once you have that mask on you, make sure that you put that mask on other people. So

420
0:43:02,160 --> 0:43:11,280
throughout the months of February and March, we're going to be making donations to the ASTM

421
0:43:11,280 --> 0:43:17,920
and NH. So donations made to parasites of that borders will be matched and doubled by TWB,

422
0:43:17,920 --> 0:43:23,040
PWB, and donated to the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene. And this money

423
0:43:23,040 --> 0:43:29,760
is going to include scholarships for women from low-income parts of the world to travel to the

424
0:43:29,760 --> 0:43:35,360
annual meeting. So we're going to pledge a, hopefully we're going to get up to a maximum 40,000, but

425
0:43:35,360 --> 0:43:40,640
we are going to donate a minimum of $20,000. And part of that is going to go for these

426
0:43:41,840 --> 0:43:48,720
scholarship travel awards to basically prioritize females from low-income countries,

427
0:43:48,720 --> 0:43:54,480
who otherwise might not be able to attend. So it goes back to where I started. We are not safe

428
0:43:54,480 --> 0:43:59,280
until everyone is safe. We're seeing vaccines roll out here in the United States that all may

429
0:43:59,280 --> 0:44:04,320
be exciting, but we're not safe until everyone's safe. Let's not forget about the rest of the world.

430
0:44:04,320 --> 0:44:09,280
A couple of email for Daniel. If you want to send in a question, Daniel at microbe.tv,

431
0:44:09,280 --> 0:44:15,600
the first is from Debbie, who wants to advise a friend on setting daughters back to school in

432
0:44:15,600 --> 0:44:22,080
Maryland, where they're living in an underfunded school district, has an incredible plan to bring

433
0:44:22,080 --> 0:44:28,720
students back, small cohorts, air filters, distancing dividers at desks, etc. But she says the only

434
0:44:28,720 --> 0:44:33,840
thing that's missing is testing. I thought nothing is perfect, but air quality, cohorting,

435
0:44:33,840 --> 0:44:37,120
and testing were what I thought of as deal breakers, your thoughts.

436
0:44:37,120 --> 0:44:43,760
Yeah, you know, this continues to be, you know, a really frustrating challenge is that people

437
0:44:43,760 --> 0:44:49,280
leave testing out. I mean, all these other things cost money too, right? You start smaller class

438
0:44:49,280 --> 0:44:53,600
sizes, you start doing all these mitigation strategies, and then they leave testing out.

439
0:44:53,600 --> 0:44:59,600
So one of the things, Debbie, I'm going to suggest you do, let's see where you are. You're in

440
0:44:59,600 --> 0:45:06,480
Maryland. What I'm going to say is reach out to one of the local provider groups in the area,

441
0:45:07,040 --> 0:45:10,960
because a lot of times we've done this at Pro Health New York. We've done this at Riverside.

442
0:45:10,960 --> 0:45:16,480
We've created the whole Let's Get Back program is, you know, sometimes the schools just leave

443
0:45:16,480 --> 0:45:21,280
this out for some reason. And if they do, there's no reason why parents and teachers organizations

444
0:45:21,280 --> 0:45:26,400
can't jump in and we can't create something. In my local town, it's actually one of our

445
0:45:26,400 --> 0:45:31,280
Pro Health providers has been working with the school. And it took a long time that they finally

446
0:45:31,280 --> 0:45:38,080
introduced testing. And testing is really, I think, part of creating the best possible solution.

447
0:45:38,800 --> 0:45:42,560
President Biden has said he really wants to get the teachers back. He really wants to get the

448
0:45:42,560 --> 0:45:48,320
kids back and in person. That's fine and all, but we've got to make sure we do everything to make

449
0:45:48,320 --> 0:45:52,880
it safe. So this is a safe decision. And I think testing is part of that.

450
0:45:54,160 --> 0:46:01,680
Terry in Orlando has a 100 year old mom who got her first dose and is preparing for the second.

451
0:46:01,680 --> 0:46:07,440
And Terry wants to know, is there anything that we should do to prepare her? And how long should

452
0:46:07,440 --> 0:46:10,080
someone stay with her afterwards to monitor her?

453
0:46:11,360 --> 0:46:16,240
Yeah. So, you know, the nice thing about older individuals that I know this was discussed on

454
0:46:16,240 --> 0:46:22,640
the last wave, is they either have less side effects, or they just complain less than young

455
0:46:22,640 --> 0:46:28,400
people, right? Young people are so horrible. I had to take pain medications. No, I think your

456
0:46:28,400 --> 0:46:34,320
healthy 100 year old mom is actually going to do very well. The observation period we recommend

457
0:46:34,320 --> 0:46:39,920
is really 15 minutes after the vaccination. No one really needs to stay with your mom. It would be

458
0:46:39,920 --> 0:46:44,480
nice if you stayed with your mom. But again, you want to weigh, you know, are you vaccinated? Is

459
0:46:44,480 --> 0:46:49,520
there a risk of exposure? But she's getting so close to being out the other side of this.

460
0:46:50,160 --> 0:46:53,840
You know, ask her doctor whether it's safe at a 100 year old woman with whatever medical

461
0:46:53,840 --> 0:47:00,720
problem she has to use something like ibuprofen or a leave or Tylenol. But no, I think that there's

462
0:47:00,720 --> 0:47:05,360
nothing too much that I would worry about here. And she has one more question. Her daughter

463
0:47:05,360 --> 0:47:11,440
is breastfeeding. Her 10 month old grandson, is there any chance if she is still breastfeeding when

464
0:47:11,440 --> 0:47:16,720
she is vaccinated that any protection will reach the grandson? And how far down the road do you think

465
0:47:16,720 --> 0:47:22,160
will be the earliest we expect one year olds to be vaccinated? Yeah, so breastfeeding. And I think

466
0:47:22,160 --> 0:47:28,480
I posted my friend Vanessa, one of my coworkers who she is breastfeeding mother who is vaccinated.

467
0:47:28,480 --> 0:47:33,280
That's one of the things like breast vaccinating a breastfeeding woman is really vaccinating two

468
0:47:33,280 --> 0:47:39,120
people. We anticipate and this has been true for all our other vaccines that when a woman starts

469
0:47:39,120 --> 0:47:45,600
making antibodies, those antibodies are then in the breast milk. So if she is vaccinated,

470
0:47:45,600 --> 0:47:51,920
once she starts making those robust levels of antibodies, we anticipate that those are being

471
0:47:51,920 --> 0:47:59,120
then transmitted to the 10 month old grandson. There are some trials looking at younger individuals.

472
0:47:59,760 --> 0:48:04,480
It's probably going to be a while before we look at one year olds. I know there was a question

473
0:48:04,480 --> 0:48:09,200
about, okay, so if you have, if you say this is allowable for this, are you allowed to stretch

474
0:48:09,200 --> 0:48:13,520
beyond that? So for instance, I'll say that J and J vaccines been given hundreds of thousands

475
0:48:13,520 --> 0:48:20,000
of individuals. You know, will it, will it be okay to give those to children? Unfortunately,

476
0:48:20,000 --> 0:48:25,920
it may be quite a while before we have any science to guide this. So there may be judgment calls at

477
0:48:25,920 --> 0:48:30,960
some point. All right, one more from Carson. You've said that people who recently had COVID

478
0:48:30,960 --> 0:48:37,040
should still get vaccinated, but also that anyone who's had monoclonal therapy needs to wait 90 days

479
0:48:37,040 --> 0:48:41,520
because the monoclonals could prevent the person from mounting a sufficient immune response to the

480
0:48:41,520 --> 0:48:46,400
vaccine. Why isn't that the case for someone who's been infected and presumably develop their own

481
0:48:46,400 --> 0:48:50,480
antibodies? Yeah, no, this is this is an excellent question, right? And I'm going to bring two things.

482
0:48:50,480 --> 0:48:57,520
So I had a conversation with my partner, Nujali earlier today, a conversation with Fatima Johari,

483
0:48:57,520 --> 0:49:03,680
one of the the infectious disease doctors I work with at Plainview about sort of these two topics.

484
0:49:04,320 --> 0:49:11,600
And one was it was a husband and wife, and the husband had been vaccinated. And he's

485
0:49:12,640 --> 0:49:20,880
well, got just like so many, he got infected before his second second vaccine dose. And

486
0:49:21,440 --> 0:49:25,600
you know, he meets criteria for monoclonal antibodies, but he doesn't want to get the monoclonal antibodies

487
0:49:25,600 --> 0:49:29,680
because as he explained, it was so hard to get the appointments for the vaccine. If I missed this,

488
0:49:29,680 --> 0:49:34,080
I'll never get another one. And you know, try to explain that if he gets the monoclonals,

489
0:49:34,800 --> 0:49:39,520
we have we have the impression and actually the evidence that those are going to be in his system

490
0:49:39,520 --> 0:49:43,680
for 90 days. So in a sense, instead of waiting for that second dose and another two weeks for the

491
0:49:43,680 --> 0:49:48,640
antibodies, so three weeks from now, you know, within an hour, he could instantly have that

492
0:49:48,640 --> 0:49:52,640
passive immunity that lasts three months at the end of those three months, then he can go ahead

493
0:49:52,640 --> 0:49:59,040
and get his vaccine and get that boost. But what about this? This is this issue. What about someone

494
0:49:59,040 --> 0:50:04,720
who's already had an infection? Why not just wait three months just like you did with anybody

495
0:50:04,720 --> 0:50:09,920
therapies? And you'll hear different advice on this. This for me gets back to that rule,

496
0:50:09,920 --> 0:50:15,680
never miss an opportunity to vaccinate. If someone is ready and willing right now to get vaccinated,

497
0:50:15,680 --> 0:50:20,800
and you can give them that protection, which we have well studied, which we're familiar with,

498
0:50:20,800 --> 0:50:27,120
which we are learning more and more about the durability. And all the science suggests that it

499
0:50:27,120 --> 0:50:35,120
is even better than natural infection. That's why I'm saying there's no need to wait. Three months,

500
0:50:35,120 --> 0:50:39,040
maybe that person's lost interest and they decide they don't want to get vaccinated. So you've just

501
0:50:39,040 --> 0:50:45,360
lost the opportunity to immunize. And for us all to get out of this, for us to see the death count

502
0:50:45,360 --> 0:50:48,240
drop, we want to see as many people vaccinated as possible.

503
0:50:48,240 --> 0:50:55,680
That is COVID-19 clinical update number 48 with Dr. Daniel Griffin. Thanks again, Daniel.

504
0:50:55,680 --> 0:51:25,520
Oh, my pleasure. Everyone be safe.
