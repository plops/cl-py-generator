0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:06,880
This week in virology, the podcast about viruses, the kind that make you sick.

2
0:00:10,240 --> 0:00:21,520
From Microbe TV, this is Twiv, this week in virology, episode 735 recorded on March 25th, 2021.

3
0:00:22,080 --> 0:00:26,640
I'm Vincent Draconiello, and you're listening to the podcast All About Viruses.

4
0:00:26,640 --> 0:00:34,480
Joining me today from New York, Daniel Griffin. Hello, everyone. How's it going this week, Daniel?

5
0:00:36,160 --> 0:00:43,600
We are sitting on this plateau that we seem unable to get off of. As quickly as we vaccinate,

6
0:00:44,240 --> 0:00:53,680
everything opens back up, so it's a constant battle. And I have to say, that's the good news,

7
0:00:53,680 --> 0:01:00,240
right? Because around the world, the numbers seem to be increasing. So, here we are a year into

8
0:01:00,240 --> 0:01:06,240
this, and over a year into this, and we are not where we need to be. But let's be honest,

9
0:01:06,240 --> 0:01:11,360
I was listening to another podcast that said I was cheating on you, listening to other people's

10
0:01:11,360 --> 0:01:19,440
podcasts. It's okay. And it was actually Anthony Fauci was talking, it was 1984.

11
0:01:19,440 --> 0:01:25,120
And he was saying, we have the virus, we know the sequence, I expect to get back to you within

12
0:01:25,120 --> 0:01:34,320
the year with a cure and a vaccine. And I was like 16 plus 37 years ago. So, this is miraculous,

13
0:01:34,320 --> 0:01:40,400
right? Then we went in less than a year from a sequence to a vaccine. But it's not miraculous.

14
0:01:40,400 --> 0:01:47,280
This is science. This is all that, did I say basic science that we spent all this money

15
0:01:47,280 --> 0:01:55,040
investing in? My quotation, every great dream begins with a dreamer. Always remember, you have

16
0:01:55,040 --> 0:02:01,120
within you the strength, the patience and the passion to reach for the stars to change the world.

17
0:02:02,000 --> 0:02:06,320
And that was Harriet Tubman. And I think maybe that's sort of appropriate with what we were

18
0:02:06,320 --> 0:02:14,880
just saying. This really has been tremendous over the last year to go from identifying that

19
0:02:14,880 --> 0:02:21,360
some people are dying from a strange illness unidentified to understanding the etiology

20
0:02:21,360 --> 0:02:28,560
to a really impressive vaccine. We haven't done quite so well in other measures as far as

21
0:02:28,560 --> 0:02:32,960
therapeutics, but the vaccine has really been quite impressive. So I'll make sure I spend a

22
0:02:32,960 --> 0:02:38,080
little time talking about that today. But my rules never miss an opportunity to vaccinate,

23
0:02:38,080 --> 0:02:45,920
never miss an opportunity to test, never waste a vaccine dose. So I'm going to title today's

24
0:02:45,920 --> 0:02:52,800
episode, school shots and cocktails. I'm not sure how schools fit in with the shots and cocktails,

25
0:02:52,800 --> 0:02:57,600
but the shots and cocktails I call is the Irish method for ending the pandemic.

26
0:02:57,600 --> 0:03:03,920
So there have been a few ID society, ID essay, ID society of America updates.

27
0:03:03,920 --> 0:03:08,880
So I'm going to sort of pepper those in as we get there. But there also were some nice

28
0:03:08,880 --> 0:03:15,680
reports from the CDC on schools. So in our section, children and COVID, let's start there.

29
0:03:16,320 --> 0:03:21,760
I mentioned last week that I was not particularly impressed with the Massachusetts study. That was

30
0:03:21,760 --> 0:03:27,520
the three six foot study. That was not even quite observational. But I did intimate that there was

31
0:03:27,520 --> 0:03:33,840
good data out there, and that we had the suggestion that we would be getting more of it and the CDC

32
0:03:33,840 --> 0:03:41,360
delivered on their promise. The MMWR, COVID-19 in primary and secondary school settings,

33
0:03:41,360 --> 0:03:47,120
during the first semester of school reopening, Florida, August through December 2020.

34
0:03:47,120 --> 0:03:54,560
So this was a report looking at close to 3 million registered students that were enrolled in approximately

35
0:03:54,560 --> 0:04:02,240
6,800 public charter and private K through 12 schools range from a small size, maybe 707

36
0:04:02,240 --> 0:04:07,920
to over 300,000 students per school district. And most of these schools had actually resumed

37
0:04:07,920 --> 0:04:15,840
in-person instruction sometime during August of 2020, except for those in two of the largest

38
0:04:15,840 --> 0:04:21,200
school districts. Broward and Miami-Dade, which began remote learning in August, but did not resume

39
0:04:21,200 --> 0:04:26,560
in-person instruction until October 9th and then November 10th, respectively.

40
0:04:26,560 --> 0:04:33,520
Statewide, as of September 24th, almost half 45% of registered students received full-time

41
0:04:33,520 --> 0:04:39,680
in-person instruction. So really, the question here was, how did that go? So to assess the occurrence

42
0:04:39,680 --> 0:04:46,800
of COVID-19 in the Florida schools after resumption of in-person instruction, the CDC and the Florida

43
0:04:46,800 --> 0:04:52,640
Department of Health reviewed school-related cases and outbreaks during August through December

44
0:04:52,640 --> 0:04:58,560
of 2020. And the County Health Department's staff members conducted case investigations

45
0:04:59,280 --> 0:05:06,000
and contact tracing for all COVID-19 cases. So this was, I have to say, there was a lot of rigor

46
0:05:06,000 --> 0:05:11,760
here. They were really looking into this and they found that fewer than 1% of registered

47
0:05:11,760 --> 0:05:17,600
students were identified as having school-related COVID-19. So significant findings were that most

48
0:05:17,600 --> 0:05:23,440
of the identified cases in this age group were not school exposure-related. And I know I've brought

49
0:05:23,440 --> 0:05:29,120
this up on some talks. Parents get upset when I suggest that perhaps the children are safer in

50
0:05:29,120 --> 0:05:34,480
the schools than sometimes they are at home. But it is not apparent in common. It's that your child

51
0:05:34,480 --> 0:05:40,640
is home all day socially isolated. There's a tendency for the kids then to get together after

52
0:05:40,640 --> 0:05:46,320
that period of remote learning. One of the comments here is that masks being mandated

53
0:05:47,040 --> 0:05:53,200
was associated with less transmission. And that was a p-value of less than 0.01. And the other

54
0:05:53,200 --> 0:05:57,440
thing that was a predictor was community case rates. So once community case rates started to go up,

55
0:05:57,440 --> 0:06:02,400
this was associated with a higher risk. And that had an even more significant p-value of less than

56
0:06:02,400 --> 0:06:09,200
0.01. There was another study. And actually, I've been a few, but just to highlight another one,

57
0:06:09,200 --> 0:06:17,200
low SARS-CoV-2 transmission in elementary schools, Salt Lake County, Utah, December 3, 2020 through

58
0:06:17,200 --> 0:06:24,000
January 31, 2021. And here, there were very similar findings, including low school associated

59
0:06:24,000 --> 0:06:31,680
transmission with high mask adherence and classroom seat separation of three feet apart.

60
0:06:32,320 --> 0:06:36,960
So I know here in, I have to say right here in North Shore of Long Island, our schools are

61
0:06:36,960 --> 0:06:45,520
getting ready to open up for fall in person next month in April. They're looking at the three feet.

62
0:06:45,520 --> 0:06:52,560
And as I mentioned, the three feet is something that's really required for getting people back

63
0:06:52,560 --> 0:06:57,360
to fall in person school. Very few parts of our country have the real estate, the size,

64
0:06:57,360 --> 0:07:04,320
the space to do six foot spacing. And the data I suggested last time is you get about E percent

65
0:07:04,320 --> 0:07:10,240
of the benefit at three feet. You get down to 90% reduction by six feet, but you get most of that

66
0:07:10,800 --> 0:07:15,520
bang for the buck in the first three feet. You couple that with masks, you couple that with

67
0:07:15,520 --> 0:07:22,000
upgraded ventilation systems. You add testing. And I think that this, again, this is something

68
0:07:22,000 --> 0:07:29,760
that can be done at low risk. So we're getting more data. This is a science driven recommendation.

69
0:07:29,760 --> 0:07:37,920
Testing, the CDC updated its guidance on testing. So I know there's been a lot of focus on vaccines.

70
0:07:37,920 --> 0:07:43,120
And we've forgotten about our poor tests, but there are key points in the updated recommendations.

71
0:07:43,120 --> 0:07:49,600
So one, they said persons with signs or symptoms of COVID-19 should have diagnostic testing.

72
0:07:50,160 --> 0:07:56,240
I know there's a tendency to give out the presumptive diagnosis, but we really want to confirm these.

73
0:07:56,240 --> 0:08:00,880
And so the CDC is really saying, get people tested, document what's going on here.

74
0:08:00,880 --> 0:08:09,040
Rapid point of care, serial screening can identify asymptomatic cases and helped interrupt SARS-CoV-2

75
0:08:09,040 --> 0:08:13,440
transmission. They're going to say this is especially important when community risk or

76
0:08:13,440 --> 0:08:20,400
transmission levels are substantial or high. And this sort of goes into that frequency.

77
0:08:20,400 --> 0:08:26,480
And rapid results are really critical. What gets us into trouble are these resulting delays. They

78
0:08:26,480 --> 0:08:32,800
really have in the CDC coming out here really endorsing the use of rapid point of care tests.

79
0:08:33,680 --> 0:08:40,000
These are being used so by clinicians across the board and then making a judgment. If it's

80
0:08:40,000 --> 0:08:45,680
positive and it makes sense, great. If it's negative and doesn't make sense, looking at PCR,

81
0:08:45,680 --> 0:08:51,440
looking at make decisions about isolation, quarantining, etc. The selection and interpretation

82
0:08:51,440 --> 0:08:57,600
of SARS-CoV-2 tests should be based on the context in which they are being used, including the

83
0:08:57,600 --> 0:09:03,360
prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 and the population being tested. So testing gets a little sophisticated,

84
0:09:03,360 --> 0:09:08,400
as we've talked about. There's negative and positive predictive values, which are maybe more

85
0:09:08,400 --> 0:09:14,560
important than sensitivity and specificity as really sensitivity, specificity need to be

86
0:09:14,560 --> 0:09:19,920
brought into the context of prevalence, which ultimately tells you when a test is positive or

87
0:09:19,920 --> 0:09:24,800
negative, how confident can you be in that result? And then this, I think, is really important. I

88
0:09:24,800 --> 0:09:30,240
get this question quite a lot. So it's nice to get the CDC putting up something on this prior

89
0:09:30,240 --> 0:09:38,320
receipt of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine will not affect the results of SARS-CoV-2 viral tests.

90
0:09:38,320 --> 0:09:41,920
All right, a lot of people ask that. So I've been vaccinated, so can I even look at the test

91
0:09:41,920 --> 0:09:49,520
results? And yes, you can. You can still count on these. And I will say that there is now about

92
0:09:49,520 --> 0:09:56,480
$10 billion available for K through 12 schools to expand the coronavirus screening of staff and

93
0:09:56,480 --> 0:10:02,640
students. And I think this was a quote, but this funding could be used for schools to offer

94
0:10:02,640 --> 0:10:07,920
rapid antigen tests that generate results in 15 minutes, allowing schools to quickly respond

95
0:10:07,920 --> 0:10:15,280
when students or staff test positive for the virus. And finally, our article identifying

96
0:10:15,840 --> 0:10:22,560
optimal COVID-19 testing strategies for schools and businesses, balancing testing frequency,

97
0:10:22,560 --> 0:10:28,160
individual test technology, and cost was published. It was actually was interesting. It was under

98
0:10:28,160 --> 0:10:34,640
embargo until about 2 p.m. today. So I couldn't talk about this until, well, a few hours before

99
0:10:34,640 --> 0:10:39,200
Vincent and I recorded this, but now it's fair game once this gets dropped. But this article is

100
0:10:39,200 --> 0:10:44,480
an open access article in plus one. And what we're doing is trying to create paradigms,

101
0:10:45,040 --> 0:10:50,880
some sort of guidance on how people can use testing in the school and actually really any

102
0:10:50,880 --> 0:10:55,360
opening plan that they might have. I've been getting a lot of questions and really goes back to

103
0:10:56,320 --> 0:11:01,600
the variant thing. And the question I've got lately is whether a person infected with a variant

104
0:11:01,600 --> 0:11:08,720
will still have a positive COVID PCR. So I'll cover this here in the testing section. And when I

105
0:11:08,720 --> 0:11:14,080
when I get this question, I usually say yes, but then I walk through the technology of the tests.

106
0:11:14,080 --> 0:11:20,560
And I point out that many of the COVID PCR tests, which really should be SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests,

107
0:11:21,440 --> 0:11:29,600
go to Quest or LabCorp. The Quest PCR primers target nucleic capsid. The LabCorp PCR test says

108
0:11:29,600 --> 0:11:36,080
one primer set targeting nucleic capsid and another targeting the RNA dependent RNA polymerase

109
0:11:36,080 --> 0:11:41,600
sequence. Therefore, a change in the sequence of the spike protein should not impact this test.

110
0:11:42,240 --> 0:11:46,640
In addition to the logic here, this has actually been studied in both Quest and LabCorp have come

111
0:11:46,640 --> 0:11:51,520
out saying that, yeah, this understanding translates into reality and that these tests

112
0:11:51,520 --> 0:11:58,480
continue to be sensitive and specific despite changes in the sequence of the spike protein.

113
0:11:58,480 --> 0:12:03,280
So as I say, the test still gives you a positive result, even if your infection is with a variant,

114
0:12:03,280 --> 0:12:10,160
but it does not tell you whether this positive result is detecting that you have or do not have

115
0:12:10,160 --> 0:12:14,880
a variant. And unfortunately, we still are doing very limited amounts of sequencing,

116
0:12:15,440 --> 0:12:21,040
so we don't quite have the robust surveillance that actually is probably important for monoclonals

117
0:12:21,040 --> 0:12:27,040
when we get there. Okay, active vaccination. I've got a few questions I get hit with,

118
0:12:27,040 --> 0:12:34,000
so I'm going to put them out here. Can a person get COVID after the vaccine? The answer is yes,

119
0:12:34,560 --> 0:12:40,240
but it is much less likely. And when they do, they tend to do much better. We actually have

120
0:12:40,240 --> 0:12:47,120
some pretty robust data really suggesting that the vaccines are impacting not only symptomatic,

121
0:12:47,120 --> 0:12:54,080
but also asymptomatic and certainly severe or critical disease. If I had COVID, how long should I

122
0:12:54,080 --> 0:13:01,440
wait to get my vaccine? The CDC and I, on the same page on this, we recommend no minimal interval.

123
0:13:01,440 --> 0:13:05,760
As soon as you feel well, go get that vaccine. You don't want to go out during the first 10

124
0:13:05,760 --> 0:13:10,000
days, right? You're in isolation, but as soon as that isolation ends, as soon as you start feeling

125
0:13:10,000 --> 0:13:16,720
better, get yourself scheduled, get out there. If I get COVID after my first shot,

126
0:13:17,840 --> 0:13:22,000
should I still get my second shot? And again, this goes back to the same thing.

127
0:13:22,000 --> 0:13:26,640
As soon as you feel better, you can go ahead and get that second dose, you know, wait your 10

128
0:13:26,640 --> 0:13:31,520
days of isolation. So you're not going to the vaccine center, getting everyone sick and infected.

129
0:13:32,160 --> 0:13:38,640
Most of the sites have a manage my appointment feature online. So you can actually go in and

130
0:13:38,640 --> 0:13:43,760
push that off a little if you're 10 day isolation, if your symptoms mean that there's going to be

131
0:13:43,760 --> 0:13:51,360
a little bit of a delay here. If I had long COVID or had COVID before, should I get that second shot

132
0:13:51,360 --> 0:13:56,880
of the two shot vaccines? This can get a little complicated, but I'm going to say we do recommend

133
0:13:56,880 --> 0:14:02,960
two shots for everyone. And of note, we're hearing more reports. I'm going to cover one here today,

134
0:14:02,960 --> 0:14:10,240
that improvement in long COVID often doesn't come until after that second shot. Certainly,

135
0:14:10,240 --> 0:14:16,160
if someone has a anaphylactic or an autoimmune or a concerning reaction, then whether or not you

136
0:14:16,160 --> 0:14:21,200
get a second shot should be a decision made in consultation with a specialist. But in general,

137
0:14:21,200 --> 0:14:27,520
the answer is get that second shot. Do vaccines prevent asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection?

138
0:14:28,240 --> 0:14:32,960
And I'll say here, although we have good data, vaccines prevent symptomatic and severe COVID.

139
0:14:34,560 --> 0:14:38,400
That's really going to be ending this pandemic is really going to depend a large part

140
0:14:38,400 --> 0:14:46,240
on the impact on asymptomatic infection and transmission. As we know that about 50% of the

141
0:14:46,240 --> 0:14:52,880
transmission is probably done by either pre or asymptomatic individuals. So we are getting more

142
0:14:52,880 --> 0:14:58,000
information suggesting that it prevents asymptomatic infection as well. All right, we have another

143
0:14:58,000 --> 0:15:05,920
paper here, impact of COVID-19 vaccine on asymptomatic infection among patients undergoing

144
0:15:05,920 --> 0:15:12,000
pre procedural COVID-19 molecular screening. This was published in CID and goes right at that

145
0:15:12,000 --> 0:15:19,120
issue. So these are asymptomatic individuals who are being tested as a pre procedural screen.

146
0:15:19,840 --> 0:15:26,800
So this group conducted a retrospective cohort study of consecutive asymptomatic adult patients

147
0:15:26,800 --> 0:15:34,720
and N of 39,156. This was done within a large healthcare system here in the United States.

148
0:15:34,720 --> 0:15:42,160
They underwent over 48,000 pre procedural SARS-CoV-2 molecular screening tests,

149
0:15:42,160 --> 0:15:49,440
December 17 through February 8, 2021. They compared individuals who had received at least one dose

150
0:15:49,440 --> 0:15:57,040
of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine versus those that had not. And they looked at the relative risk of a

151
0:15:57,040 --> 0:16:04,000
positive SARS-CoV-2 molecular test among these asymptomatic persons. And then they adjusted the

152
0:16:04,000 --> 0:16:12,080
relative risk. They found that compared to unvaccinated individuals, the risk of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2

153
0:16:13,120 --> 0:16:20,480
detection was lower among those greater than 10 days after the first dose. Their relative risk

154
0:16:20,480 --> 0:16:30,240
was 0.21. I think this is critical here. This is suggesting an 80, almost an 80% production

155
0:16:30,240 --> 0:16:34,960
in the risk of an asymptomatic infection, which is interesting. How do we define infection if

156
0:16:34,960 --> 0:16:41,840
you've got infected, but no symptoms. But also we are seeing, right? As we translate this,

157
0:16:41,840 --> 0:16:48,080
we have vaccinated millions of individuals, which means an 80% reduction means we are still seeing

158
0:16:48,080 --> 0:16:53,920
lots of people who are PCR positive after their vaccines. And as I mentioned before,

159
0:16:53,920 --> 0:16:58,960
the experience we're seeing is they tend to do quite well. And I think the science and experience

160
0:16:58,960 --> 0:17:04,720
support that. Now, I mentioned briefly on the last twib this observation that we're seeing this. So

161
0:17:04,720 --> 0:17:09,120
just to sort of give you the real world mixed with what we're seeing in the literature.

162
0:17:09,120 --> 0:17:16,480
The question of are vaccines safe in patients with long COVID a prospective observational study?

163
0:17:17,120 --> 0:17:22,640
This was posted as a preprint by group out of the UK. And this is looking at that issue of

164
0:17:22,640 --> 0:17:27,760
vaccine impact on long COVID. And you can see here, they're really going into this with the

165
0:17:27,760 --> 0:17:30,800
question of, is it going to be safe? Are they going to be OK? Will there be harm?

166
0:17:31,440 --> 0:17:37,280
And this group looked at patients that had COVID-19 severe enough to require hospitalization,

167
0:17:37,280 --> 0:17:42,160
who then went on to develop long COVID. And as I'll talk later, that's a minority.

168
0:17:42,160 --> 0:17:45,120
Most people with long COVID never were sick enough to end up in the hospital.

169
0:17:45,840 --> 0:17:51,920
They looked prospectively at 44 vaccinated participants and 22 matched unvaccinated

170
0:17:51,920 --> 0:17:58,240
participants and assessed them at a medium of 30 median of 32 days post vaccination.

171
0:17:59,200 --> 0:18:05,120
These were mostly people with severe or highly symptomatic long COVID out about eight months

172
0:18:05,120 --> 0:18:12,880
after acute infection. And they reported that 23.2% reported an increase in symptom resolution

173
0:18:12,880 --> 0:18:22,240
versus 15.4% in the unvaccinated with a p-value of 0.035 in just this small sample size. They

174
0:18:22,240 --> 0:18:29,120
reported no obvious difference in response between mRNA vaccination versus ad no viral vector vaccination.

175
0:18:29,840 --> 0:18:34,560
So it's nice to actually start to have some science here instead of lots of building anecdotes.

176
0:18:35,120 --> 0:18:38,720
This is encouraging and does seem in line what we've been hearing from patients,

177
0:18:38,720 --> 0:18:45,680
a physician or post COVID recovery clinics and support groups, but still a few caveats, right?

178
0:18:45,680 --> 0:18:51,280
This study only looked at post first dose improvement. So I wouldn't hang my hat on the percent

179
0:18:51,280 --> 0:18:56,240
reporting improvement. As we're hearing, as I mentioned before, that some do not report

180
0:18:56,240 --> 0:19:01,280
improvement until after their second dose or farther out with the one dose J and J vaccine.

181
0:19:01,280 --> 0:19:06,400
This is also a small sample size with really short follow up. So we do not know much about

182
0:19:06,400 --> 0:19:13,120
the long term as far as the durability of this reported improvement. But this study does support

183
0:19:13,120 --> 0:19:19,200
the safety of vaccination for people even with severe long COVID. And there is here this

184
0:19:19,200 --> 0:19:25,440
suggestion of possible benefit AstraZeneca vaccine, the white elephant in the vaccine room.

185
0:19:26,160 --> 0:19:31,920
We got a press release reporting the results of the AstraZeneca U.S. Phase III trial demonstrating

186
0:19:31,920 --> 0:19:39,520
statistically significant vaccine efficacy of 79% at preventing symptomatic COVID-19 and 100%

187
0:19:39,520 --> 0:19:44,880
efficacy at preventing severe disease and hospitalization. A lot of people got really excited.

188
0:19:45,520 --> 0:19:53,040
Anthony Fauci said this is fantastic, but maybe not. I liken this to someone's getting measured

189
0:19:53,040 --> 0:19:59,920
and you notice they're standing on their tippy toes. It may be 76% at preventing symptomatic.

190
0:19:59,920 --> 0:20:05,600
But we heard I think some disturbing news that maybe they had cherry picked. Maybe they had not

191
0:20:05,600 --> 0:20:12,160
presented the most up to date data. It's a little disturbing because the thing we really care about

192
0:20:12,160 --> 0:20:18,000
is this vaccine that keeps people from dying from ending up in the hospital. That data has

193
0:20:18,000 --> 0:20:23,280
continued to be very clear. This other sort of competitive number, you know, what's the number

194
0:20:23,280 --> 0:20:31,360
for mild disease, whether it's 76, whether it's 79, would have been better if this data had been

195
0:20:31,360 --> 0:20:38,880
presented better. It's unfortunate here because this is really a great vaccine from a physician

196
0:20:38,880 --> 0:20:45,040
standpoint. This is easy to use. It can be stored, transported, handled at normal refrigeration

197
0:20:45,040 --> 0:20:50,560
conditions for out to about six months. It doesn't need any kind of preparation before you administer.

198
0:20:50,560 --> 0:20:57,360
So it's a much easier vaccine for us. But as we heard, the data safety monitoring board notified

199
0:20:57,360 --> 0:21:03,360
everyone that this data was not quite the data that we wanted it to be. So I will return to

200
0:21:03,360 --> 0:21:09,920
the AstraZeneca vaccine when all the information is available for the FDA review and we have a

201
0:21:09,920 --> 0:21:15,040
chance to go through the data. So just want to sort of remind everyone here, we're not just

202
0:21:15,040 --> 0:21:20,640
oh, call it a vaccine and we're pro, we're going to be honest. And when something like this happens,

203
0:21:20,640 --> 0:21:27,520
we're going to share that as I'm doing here now. Passive vaccination. This is the monoclonal antibodies,

204
0:21:27,520 --> 0:21:33,280
really good uptake of the monoclonal antiviral cocktails. And we continue to see excellent results.

205
0:21:33,920 --> 0:21:40,160
This is now part of the IDSA guidelines. But what exactly did the guidelines say? They advocate

206
0:21:40,160 --> 0:21:46,160
for the use of BAM linibimab and the test of a map together in outpatients with mild to moderate

207
0:21:46,160 --> 0:21:53,440
disease who are at high risk for progression to severe disease and say that CASA ribimab,

208
0:21:53,440 --> 0:22:01,280
MDivimab, may have a similar clinical benefit, but the data are currently limited. Well, I have

209
0:22:01,280 --> 0:22:07,280
to say in the days of COVID, the concept of living guidelines is presented with lots of challenges

210
0:22:07,280 --> 0:22:12,880
as we live in a day of the days of the fire hose of information. And this week, Tuesday,

211
0:22:12,880 --> 0:22:18,400
March 23rd, Regeneron released the data from their phase three trial as promised. So I feel like

212
0:22:18,400 --> 0:22:24,480
these guidelines need to be rapidly updated. These results from Regeneron were from a phase

213
0:22:24,480 --> 0:22:30,160
three randomized control trial looking at treatment in infected non-hospitalized patients,

214
0:22:30,160 --> 0:22:39,840
4,567 in this trial. They met the primary endpoint of showing that the Regeneron COV,

215
0:22:39,840 --> 0:22:46,160
so this is the Regeneron cocktail with the CASA ribimab and MDivimab significantly reduced the

216
0:22:46,160 --> 0:22:53,360
risk of hospitalization or death by 70% with the low dose, 71% with the higher dose compared to

217
0:22:53,360 --> 0:23:03,840
placebo. And the p-values for high and low dose were either 0.0024 or less than 0.001.

218
0:23:03,840 --> 0:23:10,720
No safety issues were observed. So I think the data is becoming really, really compelling for

219
0:23:10,720 --> 0:23:17,040
the impact of this approach, the monoclonal cocktail approach. What was really interesting,

220
0:23:17,040 --> 0:23:21,680
I have to say in this press release and looking forward to the published data is they actually

221
0:23:21,680 --> 0:23:28,800
provided a table of neutralization data looking at several variants from different regions of

222
0:23:28,800 --> 0:23:35,520
the world. They tested key substitutions and actually showed that this therapy based on this

223
0:23:35,520 --> 0:23:42,480
data would continue to be effective. So we've moved to cocktails, I think as I mentioned across the

224
0:23:43,280 --> 0:23:49,200
across the country. So vaccine shots and monoclonal cocktails for everyone. The early

225
0:23:49,200 --> 0:23:53,760
inflammatory phase, we have a little bit of information here. There was a paper aspirin use

226
0:23:53,760 --> 0:23:58,000
is associated with decreased mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit admission,

227
0:23:58,000 --> 0:24:04,640
and in hospital mortality in hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 was published in

228
0:24:04,640 --> 0:24:12,000
the journal of anesthesia and analgesia. This was a retrospective observational cohort study,

229
0:24:12,000 --> 0:24:16,880
right? So we got to put that in that context. They looked at COVID-19 patients admitted to

230
0:24:16,880 --> 0:24:23,440
multiple hospitals in the United States between March and July of 2020. And the authors looked

231
0:24:23,440 --> 0:24:28,320
back through the medical records, basically identifying who was on aspirin, who wasn't on

232
0:24:28,320 --> 0:24:33,200
aspirin, and then they tried to adjust. But I want to point out this was not a randomized,

233
0:24:33,200 --> 0:24:41,760
blinded prospective trial. They ultimately looked at 412 patients, 314, about 76% not getting

234
0:24:41,760 --> 0:24:47,760
aspirin, 98 patients who are about 24% did get aspirin. And they reported seeing that patients

235
0:24:47,760 --> 0:24:52,960
getting aspirin were less likely to end up needing to be transferred to the ICU, less likely to

236
0:24:52,960 --> 0:24:58,480
end up needing mechanical ventilation, and less likely to die well in the hospital. And they did

237
0:24:58,480 --> 0:25:04,560
not report any significant increase in bleeding complications. So just to put this in context,

238
0:25:04,560 --> 0:25:09,280
this is not a prospective randomized control trial, but sort of interesting attention on the

239
0:25:09,280 --> 0:25:14,800
possible role of aspirin. And here again, in this section, the early inflammatory phase,

240
0:25:14,800 --> 0:25:21,120
the IDSA has updated its guidelines and is now recommending that tosyllism apps should be

241
0:25:21,120 --> 0:25:27,920
used in hospitalized patients who are sick enough to have progressed severe or critical COVID-19.

242
0:25:27,920 --> 0:25:34,000
But a note is that this is an add-on to steroid therapy. All right, we actually have a bunch

243
0:25:34,000 --> 0:25:42,640
today on the long COVID, the post-acute sequelae COVID-19. So there was a really nice review,

244
0:25:43,200 --> 0:25:50,400
post-acute COVID-19 syndrome that was published in Nature Medicine. And there really was so much

245
0:25:50,400 --> 0:25:55,600
here that I'm going to actually say people should sit down, read this once, twice, three times.

246
0:25:56,240 --> 0:26:03,200
They have a really nice box summary of the post-acute COVID-19 issues by Oregon system.

247
0:26:03,200 --> 0:26:09,520
So they go through all the pulmonary issues, hematological, cardiovascular, neuropsychiatric,

248
0:26:10,240 --> 0:26:17,760
renal, endocrine, GI dermatologic, and then even have a little section on the Miss C.

249
0:26:18,560 --> 0:26:24,000
So this is excellent. And I think as we're working with these patients in our long COVID,

250
0:26:24,000 --> 0:26:30,400
our post-acute COVID recovery centers, this is actually a helpful paper for realizing that

251
0:26:30,400 --> 0:26:36,240
it actually takes a team to help these individuals. The neurologist might jump in with a lot of the

252
0:26:36,240 --> 0:26:43,280
severe headaches, which seem vascular, migraine type. Pulmonary is critical, cardiology.

253
0:26:44,000 --> 0:26:51,280
There's a lot of complexity here. We also saw COVID-19 survivors reports of the timing,

254
0:26:51,280 --> 0:26:58,480
duration, and health impacts of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2, P-A-S-C infection was

255
0:26:58,480 --> 0:27:04,400
posted as a preprint. Now, this was a very interesting paper in that the participants in the study

256
0:27:04,400 --> 0:27:12,560
are members of long COVID support groups. And I think this represents an exciting development

257
0:27:12,560 --> 0:27:18,480
whereby citizen scientists are working together with data and other scientists to try to understand

258
0:27:18,480 --> 0:27:23,920
the challenges, the needs and characteristics of these people suffering from long COVID or

259
0:27:23,920 --> 0:27:30,160
what's now termed post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2. I mean, very interesting and consistent with my

260
0:27:30,160 --> 0:27:37,200
experience are the described stages or waves of this post-acute COVID experience. With this early

261
0:27:37,200 --> 0:27:42,800
wave with neurological and cardiovascular manifestations, then a second wave with skin

262
0:27:42,800 --> 0:27:48,800
manifestations such as COVID toes, hair loss, and then this final wave of symptoms during which the

263
0:27:48,800 --> 0:27:55,200
fatigue just continues to be ongoing. So, I think that this is sort of, I think, nice for

264
0:27:55,200 --> 0:28:00,400
clinicians who are taking care of these patients to see how the patients are describing this

265
0:28:00,400 --> 0:28:05,760
experience. I think it helps for the patients as well to speak to a clinician that has had the

266
0:28:05,760 --> 0:28:09,600
ability to sort of understand this. There's a lot of validation for the patients here

267
0:28:10,240 --> 0:28:15,280
when you can sort of be almost anticipating where they are in this process and what the

268
0:28:15,280 --> 0:28:20,720
challenges might be at that time. I mean, there certainly are limitations here. I mean,

269
0:28:20,720 --> 0:28:26,480
one is that this was predominantly white women since the participants come from online support

270
0:28:26,480 --> 0:28:32,080
groups. There's a certain amount of selection, so this isn't a random sample. But one of the things

271
0:28:32,080 --> 0:28:36,800
I was going to say, I've heard several times where clinicians look at people with long COVID and

272
0:28:36,800 --> 0:28:41,920
they say, you know what, these people are doing much better than the average ICU survivor. If I

273
0:28:41,920 --> 0:28:46,800
was in the ICU and survived, I'd rather have long COVID than something else. And what I like to point

274
0:28:46,800 --> 0:28:53,200
out here, and this was very clear from the paper, is that 84% of these people who are doing so well

275
0:28:53,200 --> 0:28:58,720
compared to someone who spent a month in the ICU never were even hospitalized. A lot of these

276
0:28:58,720 --> 0:29:04,800
individuals started off with a mild or even asymptomatic acute COVID. And here they are

277
0:29:05,600 --> 0:29:11,440
many, many months later looking a little bit better than someone who was in the ICU for sepsis or

278
0:29:11,440 --> 0:29:17,840
something else. Also another paper, persistent neurological symptoms and cognitive dysfunction

279
0:29:17,840 --> 0:29:24,080
in non-hospitalized COVID-19 long haulers. This was published in the Annals of Clinical and

280
0:29:24,080 --> 0:29:30,880
Translational Neurology. So they reported other results from this was a prospective study of 100

281
0:29:30,880 --> 0:29:38,240
consecutive patients, SARS-CoV-2 laboratory positive, and then they had a 50 laboratory

282
0:29:38,240 --> 0:29:44,000
negative control group. And these individuals presented to a neuro COVID-19 clinic.

283
0:29:44,720 --> 0:29:50,720
So due to early pandemic testing limitations, patients were included. If they were never

284
0:29:50,720 --> 0:29:57,200
hospitalized for pneumonia or hypoxemia and had neurological symptoms lasting over six weeks.

285
0:29:57,760 --> 0:30:03,680
So this is sort of a snapshot of those people who never ended up in the hospital but had a

286
0:30:03,680 --> 0:30:08,320
neurological issue that required attention. And they reported that the main neurological

287
0:30:08,320 --> 0:30:13,760
manifestations were, I think this will sound familiar to people, brain fog was reported

288
0:30:13,760 --> 0:30:21,760
81% that feeling that you just can't think clearly. 68% were reporting headaches. And as I've mentioned

289
0:30:21,760 --> 0:30:27,680
a lot of these headaches actually seem like the intractable vascular migraine severe headaches.

290
0:30:27,680 --> 0:30:38,240
Numbness tingling, 60%. Disguysia, 59%. And nausea, 55%. Myalgia, 55%. And the overwhelming,

291
0:30:38,240 --> 0:30:44,560
85% had this ongoing fatigue. And they exhibited impaired quality of life in cognitive and

292
0:30:44,560 --> 0:30:50,480
fatigue domains. And the patient performed worse attention and working memory cognitive tests

293
0:30:50,480 --> 0:30:56,640
compared to that control population and a demographically matched US population. So

294
0:30:56,640 --> 0:31:01,680
I think this points out what's really upsetting to a lot of us just how many of these patients

295
0:31:01,680 --> 0:31:07,280
are continuing to suffer. So let me close on there, leave a little time for emails. But just

296
0:31:07,280 --> 0:31:11,040
ask everyone for their continued support. And thank you so much for all the support we're

297
0:31:11,040 --> 0:31:16,720
continuing to get. We are going to continue to support the American Society for Tropical Medicine

298
0:31:17,280 --> 0:31:23,840
and Hygiene. And we're going to, it looks like we're going to succeed in being able to donate

299
0:31:23,840 --> 0:31:31,680
enough money for three travel awards, bringing early career women from low income parts of the

300
0:31:31,680 --> 0:31:38,560
world to come to the fall annual American Society for Tropical Medicine meeting. So thank you for

301
0:31:38,560 --> 0:31:44,400
continuing to support our work. Okay, it's time for some email. You can send yours to danielatmicrobe.tv.

302
0:31:44,400 --> 0:31:49,680
The first is from John Mascola, who is the director of the Vaccine Research Center at NIH.

303
0:31:49,680 --> 0:31:56,640
John writes, I love Twiv. I listen every week. And as an ID doc that does mostly research,

304
0:31:56,640 --> 0:32:01,520
I also appreciate the COVID clinical updates. So glad to help out Dr. Dan Griffin regarding

305
0:32:01,520 --> 0:32:06,960
one question that is in my wheelhouse where he did not know the answer immunogenicity

306
0:32:06,960 --> 0:32:11,920
of COVID vaccines and older subjects. There are published data showing mRNA is similarly

307
0:32:11,920 --> 0:32:18,320
immunogenic across age groups. So good news. And John provides a link for that. It'll be in

308
0:32:18,320 --> 0:32:25,280
the show notes. Thank you, John. I think this is great. I mean, this just sort of reinforces that

309
0:32:25,280 --> 0:32:30,240
this is not actually just a one man show. I mean, I get a lot of support from my colleagues.

310
0:32:30,240 --> 0:32:34,000
And I love this. I love getting emails. And you know, you can send them either directly to me

311
0:32:34,000 --> 0:32:39,200
or this is even better. Send them to, you know, Daniel at Microbe TV. And yeah, this is this

312
0:32:39,200 --> 0:32:43,840
is great. There's a lot of information. And thank you so much, John, for for sending this in.

313
0:32:43,840 --> 0:32:48,320
Yeah, if you send them to Daniel at Microbe TV, then many more people will get the answer rather

314
0:32:48,320 --> 0:32:54,960
than just you. That's better. Yeah, that makes my life easier. Send them to Daniel at microbe.tv.

315
0:32:54,960 --> 0:32:59,360
So Paul in the University of Manchester in the UK wants to know if you can comment on the

316
0:32:59,360 --> 0:33:05,760
AstraZeneca vaccine, specifically the clotting issues and wonders if he should be taking aspirin

317
0:33:05,760 --> 0:33:10,320
around the time of vaccination. Yeah, I mean, so I actually appreciate the fact that you wrote this

318
0:33:10,320 --> 0:33:16,960
and if you look at the data here, right, it looks like the incidence what 30 and about that many

319
0:33:16,960 --> 0:33:22,160
million people vaccinated, you know, one in a million, which is actually not higher than we see

320
0:33:22,160 --> 0:33:28,000
as a background in the population, almost seems lower to be honest. So I think that we've sort

321
0:33:28,000 --> 0:33:32,880
of come down with not thinking that there's any kind of clotting complication associated with

322
0:33:32,880 --> 0:33:38,800
the vaccine. But I don't think the AstraZeneca has done such a great job of instilling confidence.

323
0:33:38,800 --> 0:33:43,600
So I will weigh in and say, I do not think this is an issue. I'm not going to recommend taking

324
0:33:43,600 --> 0:33:47,920
aspirin around the vaccine. I actually think this vaccine is effective. I think it's safe,

325
0:33:47,920 --> 0:33:52,960
but it just maybe wasn't quite as effective with a few percentage points off of what they were

326
0:33:52,960 --> 0:33:59,520
trying to suggest. Anne is treating a patient, a 77 year old patient got her first vaccine on

327
0:34:00,320 --> 0:34:08,080
March 6th, and then 38 was found unresponsive and finally had a diagnosis of encephalopathy with

328
0:34:08,080 --> 0:34:15,600
possible seizure. So Anne wants to know what to do. The family is quite apprehensive about the

329
0:34:15,600 --> 0:34:20,960
patient receiving the second vaccination never has allergic reactions. Only medical intolerance

330
0:34:20,960 --> 0:34:25,440
is myalgia on statin therapy. I'm inclined to have the patient receive the second vaccination,

331
0:34:25,440 --> 0:34:30,960
but wondered if you had a different response. So this is a tough one, I have to say. This

332
0:34:30,960 --> 0:34:36,400
falls into this category where, you know, I think this is going to have to be an individual decision

333
0:34:36,400 --> 0:34:42,000
where you look at the situation and you're going to have to try to parse out. Do you think this

334
0:34:42,000 --> 0:34:47,840
encephalitis was a vaccine reaction? You know, we certainly, I think I related the story of this.

335
0:34:47,840 --> 0:34:55,680
I had a gentleman who developed an autoimmune reaction. Really, it was a really a multi-inflammatory

336
0:34:55,680 --> 0:35:03,120
type syndrome with his natural COVID infection. And he had issues with his vision to plopia.

337
0:35:03,120 --> 0:35:07,440
And then when he got his vaccine, he actually seemed to have recurrence and responded very

338
0:35:07,440 --> 0:35:14,960
quickly to steroids and IVIG. So, you know, we talk about these are agents that have efficacy,

339
0:35:14,960 --> 0:35:20,160
that have effects on the human body. So I think that this is not going to be a very easy decision.

340
0:35:20,160 --> 0:35:25,600
So Anne, I'm glad you're making it and not me. But yeah, you're going to, I think you probably

341
0:35:25,600 --> 0:35:31,680
want to reach out to your local ID, your local allergy immunology. Really, make sure that we're

342
0:35:31,680 --> 0:35:35,440
giving the best advice here. So this is complicated. All right.

343
0:35:35,440 --> 0:35:40,880
Last one is from Anthony from Brown University Medical School, who's a family physician,

344
0:35:40,880 --> 0:35:45,360
encountered a scenario this week, confused about despite the benefit of your teaching.

345
0:35:45,360 --> 0:35:49,520
I was involved in the care of an elderly woman who lives in the community, but his homebound

346
0:35:49,520 --> 0:35:54,480
has home health aides. Unfortunately, one of her aides tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 last week.

347
0:35:54,480 --> 0:35:59,600
On the day that this patient received her second mRNA vaccine, four days later, the patient

348
0:35:59,600 --> 0:36:05,760
has now tested positive, but is asymptomatic. She clearly meets criteria for eligibility for

349
0:36:05,760 --> 0:36:11,680
monoclonal antibody based on her age. The conundrum is she's also probably derived some protection

350
0:36:11,680 --> 0:36:17,120
from developing COVID from her nearly completed vaccine series. And there would be a theoretical

351
0:36:17,120 --> 0:36:20,800
concern about the passive immunization provided by monoclonal therapy,

352
0:36:20,800 --> 0:36:25,920
blunting her own immune response. We decided to get her treated, prioritizing short-term gains

353
0:36:25,920 --> 0:36:31,520
in a patient at risk. What would you say? So I would treat in this case. And let me just run

354
0:36:31,520 --> 0:36:38,400
through sort of my rule and the thinking. So if someone meets criteria, as we've shared the data,

355
0:36:38,400 --> 0:36:45,440
these are really impressive tools, the monoclonal cocktails. So you take an individual, and you

356
0:36:45,440 --> 0:36:50,880
look at this individually, say, OK, this is a person who is high risk for ending up in the hospital.

357
0:36:50,880 --> 0:36:58,880
If they end up in the hospital, we know that people often don't do very well. The monoclonals are

358
0:36:58,880 --> 0:37:03,280
really going to reduce that chance of progression. And I actually expect someone who's already had

359
0:37:03,280 --> 0:37:07,600
the benefit of the vaccination, the benefit of already starting up to have some sort of a T-cell

360
0:37:07,600 --> 0:37:11,680
response is going to do even better. That's actually I have to say what our experience has been.

361
0:37:12,480 --> 0:37:17,040
What is really the downside? I'm going to sort of ask that question. So you give the person the

362
0:37:17,040 --> 0:37:23,040
monoclonals. OK, maybe that second dose of vaccine doesn't work so well. In three months,

363
0:37:23,600 --> 0:37:28,960
you can probably go ahead and give that second dose again, basically say, OK, I sort of interfered

364
0:37:28,960 --> 0:37:33,760
with its ability to have efficacy. And for that three months while you're waiting,

365
0:37:33,760 --> 0:37:39,360
the person has these monoclonal antibodies at a very high level. They're protected. They're

366
0:37:39,360 --> 0:37:44,640
passively immunized. So basically what you're doing here is you're instantly having this person

367
0:37:44,640 --> 0:37:49,680
immunized by sending them for monoclonals rather than waiting for whatever days for the staff.

368
0:37:49,680 --> 0:37:56,640
And so I do not. We don't in any of our programs use prior vaccination as an exclusion criteria.

369
0:37:56,640 --> 0:38:02,560
If the person ends up getting infected, it's either because it wasn't enough time for them to get

370
0:38:02,560 --> 0:38:08,640
protection. But as we point out, we might do a study of 40,000 people or 20,000 get it. No one

371
0:38:08,640 --> 0:38:12,800
ends up in the hospital. But you translate that into the real world where you're starting to give

372
0:38:12,800 --> 0:38:17,440
this to older individuals. Maybe they have medical problems. Maybe they have an issue

373
0:38:17,440 --> 0:38:23,280
bouncing that protective response. They end up infected with the virus. I would advise jumping

374
0:38:23,280 --> 0:38:30,240
in with these really highly effective therapies. That's COVID-19 clinical update number 55 with

375
0:38:30,240 --> 0:38:43,600
Dr. Daniel Griffin. Thank you, Daniel. Oh, thank you so much. And everyone be safe.
