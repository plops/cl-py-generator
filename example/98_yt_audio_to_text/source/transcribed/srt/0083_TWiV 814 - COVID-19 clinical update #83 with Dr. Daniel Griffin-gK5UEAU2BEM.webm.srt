0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:06,960
This week in virology, the podcast about viruses, the kind that make you sick.

2
0:00:11,040 --> 0:00:21,440
From Microbe TV, this is Twiv. This week in virology, episode 814 recorded on October 7th, 2021.

3
0:00:21,440 --> 0:00:27,920
I'm Vincent Rackeniello, and you're listening to the podcast All About Viruses. Joining me

4
0:00:27,920 --> 0:00:34,960
today from New York, Daniel Griffin. Hello, everyone. How's everything, Daniel?

5
0:00:36,240 --> 0:00:42,240
You know, it's actually all right, you know, right here in the immediate area. Actually,

6
0:00:42,240 --> 0:00:46,320
if you look around the country, right, things are on the way down. Actually, if you look around

7
0:00:46,320 --> 0:00:52,000
the world, there's these sort of interesting cycles where things shoot up, and then it goes down,

8
0:00:52,000 --> 0:00:58,080
and we'll see where we go. But yeah, at the moment, particularly in the immediate area, but

9
0:00:58,080 --> 0:01:02,800
I was in a call earlier today. Actually, Shane Crotty was on the call. It's funny,

10
0:01:02,800 --> 0:01:07,840
because like when things come up, you know, people may think I know a lot, but I always, I'm like,

11
0:01:07,840 --> 0:01:14,080
and can I call in a friend, Shane? Can I call on you? So yeah, but in parts of the country,

12
0:01:14,080 --> 0:01:18,640
some of my colleagues on the call, it's not so great, right? There's a lot of parts of our

13
0:01:18,640 --> 0:01:25,040
country where hospitals are still overflowing, where, you know, people just not even COVID, just

14
0:01:25,040 --> 0:01:29,840
normal medical issues, they can't be seen, they're waiting, it's delaying care.

15
0:01:30,800 --> 0:01:38,000
Yeah, so we know by no means are we through this storm. Yeah, we have an email about that sort of

16
0:01:38,000 --> 0:01:43,360
situation in a certain part of the country today. Yeah, certain parts of the country, not so great.

17
0:01:43,360 --> 0:01:48,080
Well, let me start with my quotation, and then I'm going to actually share what I think is an

18
0:01:48,080 --> 0:01:54,400
entertaining story, which has a certain, well, that's a certain reason for sharing it. So the

19
0:01:54,400 --> 0:02:02,480
quotation, there are in fact two things, science and opinion. The former begets knowledge, the latter

20
0:02:02,480 --> 0:02:08,720
ignorance. And this is by Hippocrates. I just think this is very telling. I'm always a little

21
0:02:08,720 --> 0:02:13,920
disappointed when some of my colleagues seem to be sort of searching for confirmation bias to

22
0:02:13,920 --> 0:02:20,320
support their opinion, and not really just trying to move forward and learn. Hopefully, I'm trying

23
0:02:20,320 --> 0:02:27,120
to keep my opinions to a minimum and share the science so that people can form their own opinions

24
0:02:27,120 --> 0:02:33,520
based upon that science. Sort of an interesting story I think I'll share and these are dark times

25
0:02:33,520 --> 0:02:36,960
in many parts of the country. But this was a story that actually, it was the first time I

26
0:02:36,960 --> 0:02:43,040
laughed at work and well, it's been quite a while. But it was a friend, a colleague of mine who was

27
0:02:43,040 --> 0:02:48,800
telling me a story, he's embraced monoclonals, he's even though he's a cardiologist. And he's

28
0:02:48,800 --> 0:02:54,480
like, yeah, I sent this guy for monoclonals. And I was all excited that we got that done. But then

29
0:02:54,480 --> 0:02:59,200
he left an office, he left a message at the office that he went for the monoclonals. He's doing great

30
0:02:59,200 --> 0:03:04,240
now, but but he almost died. And it's like, well, my gosh, what happened? You know, it's surprising

31
0:03:04,240 --> 0:03:09,840
because these monoclonals are so safe. What happened? Well, apparently, this gentleman went for the

32
0:03:09,840 --> 0:03:16,240
monoclonals during one of these massive rainstorms that we had. And one of the things we do, right,

33
0:03:16,240 --> 0:03:20,720
we send people like during that first week, they're feverish, they're sick, and they've got to get

34
0:03:20,720 --> 0:03:26,400
into a car and either go to a tent, or in this case, go to an emergency room, get checked in,

35
0:03:26,400 --> 0:03:31,840
be there for a number of hours, get the infusion, which he went ahead and did. But as he was leaving,

36
0:03:31,840 --> 0:03:39,360
it was a torrential downpour. And so this feverish guy gets in his car and drives into an area of

37
0:03:39,360 --> 0:03:45,200
such degree of flooding that it's actually up to the window level and his car completely stalls.

38
0:03:45,200 --> 0:03:51,440
He has to actually smash out the window and then climb out the window and swim to where it's

39
0:03:51,440 --> 0:03:57,680
shallow enough. And then the first person who offers to help him, he lets them know he has

40
0:03:57,680 --> 0:04:04,480
COVID and they drive away. The police then come and they offer to drive him home until he informs

41
0:04:04,480 --> 0:04:09,440
them that he has COVID. A little bit of a pause. They call his wife who then picks him up and

42
0:04:09,440 --> 0:04:18,640
picks him home. So this was his harrowing monoclonal infusion experience. But then as he called my

43
0:04:18,640 --> 0:04:26,960
colleague, Dr. Savie said, you know, the next evening, he felt like 100%. He felt great, despite

44
0:04:26,960 --> 0:04:34,480
having COVID, despite having to swim through these freezing water. So good story. Yeah,

45
0:04:34,480 --> 0:04:39,200
it's a very, very entertaining story. But yeah, this is one of those reasons why it would be nice

46
0:04:39,200 --> 0:04:44,400
to be doing these in the home, bringing the therapies to these individuals, making it a little,

47
0:04:44,400 --> 0:04:50,800
a little more accessible. All right. So some important updates, important dates for people

48
0:04:50,800 --> 0:04:57,840
to put on their calendar. They're on my calendar. October 14 will be a discussion of the Moderna

49
0:04:57,840 --> 0:05:02,720
booster. Interesting enough, as I found out from my in-laws, everyone's already getting

50
0:05:02,720 --> 0:05:07,520
them Moderna booster. So I don't know what they're talking about. Apparently, you know,

51
0:05:07,520 --> 0:05:16,400
boosters for all. So but this will be specifically Moderna is requesting a specific Moderna third

52
0:05:16,400 --> 0:05:23,120
dose, which would be half the dose of the first two. So we'll hear what the FDA independent advisory

53
0:05:23,120 --> 0:05:31,440
panel has to say on that. The next October 15th, Jay and Jay is going to be having the FDA

54
0:05:31,440 --> 0:05:35,920
independent advisory committee discuss a booster for them. And I think we talked about the data

55
0:05:35,920 --> 0:05:43,200
there, which is actually, I would say rather compelling getting that protection for severe

56
0:05:43,200 --> 0:05:49,200
disease, hospitalization, up into the 90s, kind of at mRNA level, if you give that second dose. So

57
0:05:49,200 --> 0:05:54,560
that will be interesting to hear, but we're sort of getting positive signals on a Jay and Jay

58
0:05:55,840 --> 0:06:00,560
one and you're not done. I guess you need a second now. And also the heterologous

59
0:06:00,560 --> 0:06:07,360
booster, the mix and match. What if you had one vaccine, can you get another? A lot of people

60
0:06:07,360 --> 0:06:12,320
say, boy, I got the Pfizer. Can I just get the Moderna as my third dose? My mother actually,

61
0:06:12,320 --> 0:06:16,000
she was talking to my dad last night. So yeah, your mother, she's already signed up for her third

62
0:06:16,000 --> 0:06:20,400
dose. She she's going to get a Moderna. I'm like, what? And so I talked to my mother, she was like,

63
0:06:20,400 --> 0:06:25,680
yeah, they call me back. I had two Pfizers and I want to get a Moderna and they told me I can't do

64
0:06:25,680 --> 0:06:32,400
that. So we will find out what happens on the 15th. She still she's going to wait a little bit longer

65
0:06:32,400 --> 0:06:39,120
to get a little more data before she and I make that decision. And then October 26 for a lot of

66
0:06:39,120 --> 0:06:46,800
people Pfizer vaccine for kids, five to 11. And I'm going to talk a little bit about the fact that

67
0:06:46,800 --> 0:06:51,920
this is going to be packaged differently, a different dose, actually even a different amount will be

68
0:06:51,920 --> 0:06:57,920
injected. But we'll get to that as well. All right, so let us start off with children, COVID.

69
0:06:58,560 --> 0:07:04,960
Children are at risk for COVID. I think that's now clear. And as I like to say, wearing a mask is

70
0:07:04,960 --> 0:07:10,800
less traumatic for a child than being hospitalized. And we keep hearing about numbers in children,

71
0:07:10,800 --> 0:07:16,480
but as numbers go down across the country, we had been up to this quarter million number for

72
0:07:16,480 --> 0:07:22,640
children that's dropping below 200,000. So they're moving in the right direction there per week.

73
0:07:23,360 --> 0:07:27,680
Hospitalization is getting a little bit of improvement. But again, this is regional where

74
0:07:27,680 --> 0:07:32,880
we're seeing problems. But one of the things I wanted to talk about is I'll say success and

75
0:07:32,880 --> 0:07:38,480
maybe when there wasn't success with getting children back out there for in-person activity.

76
0:07:38,480 --> 0:07:45,360
So we have some data now on how did we do this summer in places where there was good guidance,

77
0:07:45,360 --> 0:07:50,240
vaccination, masking, et cetera, mitigation measures versus where there wasn't. So we're

78
0:07:50,240 --> 0:07:56,720
talking about a couple MMWR early releases. The first is multi component strategies to prevent

79
0:07:56,720 --> 0:08:03,840
SARS-CoV-2 transmission, nine overnight youth summer camps, the United States, June through August 2021.

80
0:08:04,400 --> 0:08:10,400
So as mentioned, this came out as an MMWR early release. And the authors reported on a total of

81
0:08:10,400 --> 0:08:18,960
7,173 campers and staff that attended nine US overnight camps that implemented multiple

82
0:08:18,960 --> 0:08:25,520
prevention strategies, including high vaccination coverage that was greater than 93% among eligible

83
0:08:25,520 --> 0:08:33,040
persons, pre-arrival and frequent screening testing. That was a total of 38,059 tests

84
0:08:33,760 --> 0:08:38,960
and additional prevention measures during this time period. There were only nine laboratory

85
0:08:38,960 --> 0:08:44,800
confirmed COVID-19 cases and no secondary infections detected during this period. So

86
0:08:45,440 --> 0:08:53,520
as I like to say, we can do this safely. On the other side of the coin, we can also mess this up.

87
0:08:53,520 --> 0:09:04,320
COVID-19 outbreaks at youth summer camps, Louisiana, June through July 2021, came out also as an MMWR early release.

88
0:09:04,320 --> 0:09:12,560
And here the authors were describing 28 camp outbreaks. There was a 31-fold increase in confirmed

89
0:09:12,560 --> 0:09:18,880
camp associated cases compared with the previous summer. And the authors comment that this period

90
0:09:18,880 --> 0:09:24,160
coincided with underutilization of preventive measures, such as the vaccines, the masking,

91
0:09:24,160 --> 0:09:31,920
the physical distancing. So you remove those mitigation measures and you can do this poorly.

92
0:09:33,840 --> 0:09:39,040
All right. Well, with the expansion, the impending, we hope, expansion of COVID vaccines

93
0:09:39,840 --> 0:09:45,120
down to the 5 and 11-year-old. There's been a lot of discussions about trying to normalize

94
0:09:45,120 --> 0:09:50,560
the COVID vaccines, trying to get them into pediatrician offices, because a lot of parents

95
0:09:50,560 --> 0:09:55,360
want to have that discussion with pediatricians, not go to one of these mass vaccination sites.

96
0:09:55,360 --> 0:10:00,400
Actually, it's coming up a lot. A lot of individuals don't really feel that comfortable going to one

97
0:10:00,400 --> 0:10:07,520
of these large sites with the security presence. Maybe I have a little bit of this bias. You know,

98
0:10:07,520 --> 0:10:11,520
if we're lost, my wife will go ask a police officer. I will. If I see a police officer,

99
0:10:11,520 --> 0:10:16,480
maybe go the other direction, maybe this is by upbringing. You know, I always joke with the

100
0:10:16,480 --> 0:10:20,480
police officers when I see them. My last name is Griffin, and we try to calculate how many

101
0:10:20,480 --> 0:10:24,480
griffins were in the front seat as police officers and how many of us were in the vaccine cause and

102
0:10:24,480 --> 0:10:31,440
trouble. But this vaccine, we are hoping a lot of parents are hoping they will be able to access

103
0:10:31,440 --> 0:10:37,200
in the pediatrician's office. So just a little bit about what are we expecting on the horizon. So

104
0:10:37,200 --> 0:10:46,080
the current Pfizer vaccine that we've been giving out has a purple cap. But we are hearing that the

105
0:10:46,080 --> 0:10:52,240
new caps for the children will be orange caps. These are going to be different vials. They're

106
0:10:52,240 --> 0:10:58,080
going to be 10 dose vials instead of the five slash six that we were doing before. It's going to be

107
0:10:58,080 --> 0:11:05,920
a different amount to dilution. This is going to be a 1.3 ml dilution. The injection rather than

108
0:11:05,920 --> 0:11:14,320
0.3 is going to be a 0.2 injection. These can sit in the ultra cold freezer for six months,

109
0:11:14,320 --> 0:11:20,560
but you can put them in the refrigerator undiluted for 10 weeks, right? That's two and a half months.

110
0:11:20,560 --> 0:11:24,880
So that's going to be a great way of getting these in pediatrician's offices, getting those

111
0:11:24,880 --> 0:11:30,240
sitting there in the refrigerator. We all, as I think sort of embarrassingly say, we have a lot

112
0:11:30,240 --> 0:11:34,880
of vaccines. We expect to have a lot of these. So we're not going to be, we're not expecting

113
0:11:34,880 --> 0:11:38,960
people to be quite as stringent with the like, don't waste a dose. It's going to be more of a

114
0:11:38,960 --> 0:11:44,320
don't miss an opportunity to vaccinate. There's also for the over 12, there's going to be a,

115
0:11:44,320 --> 0:11:51,600
we hear a new gray top to vial that is already pre-diluted. And this can then sit pre-diluted

116
0:11:51,600 --> 0:11:57,200
in a refrigerator for 10 weeks undiluted, or actually, let me see if I've got this right,

117
0:11:57,200 --> 0:12:04,320
already deluded to the consent for 10 weeks. All right. So pre-exposure transmission testing,

118
0:12:04,320 --> 0:12:10,720
another nice paper looking at the impact of vaccination on transmission. And this is really,

119
0:12:10,720 --> 0:12:16,000
I think as we've discussed, the community motivation behind vaccination and the pandemic,

120
0:12:16,000 --> 0:12:21,840
rather than just looking at individual risks. So we saw the pre-print, the impact of SARS-CoV-2

121
0:12:21,840 --> 0:12:28,640
vaccination on alpha and delta variant transmission. And this study was performed as part of the

122
0:12:28,640 --> 0:12:35,200
public health surveillance and NHS test and trace program quality assurance. And the authors

123
0:12:35,920 --> 0:12:41,040
start by providing a little bit of background that the pre-delta, there was evidence that there was

124
0:12:41,040 --> 0:12:46,640
some impact. And now they're going ahead and looking at the risk going forward. So they,

125
0:12:46,640 --> 0:12:53,200
they performed a retrospective observational cohort study of contacts of SARS-CoV-2

126
0:12:53,200 --> 0:13:00,640
infected index cases using contact testing data from England. And in this study,

127
0:13:01,680 --> 0:13:09,120
37.2% of the contacts tested were PCR positive. They looked at two doses of the

128
0:13:09,120 --> 0:13:18,320
BioNTech Pfizer or the Chadox as AstraZeneca in the alpha variant index cases. And the reductions

129
0:13:18,320 --> 0:13:29,040
they were seeing, the adjusted odds ratio 0.18 versus 0.37. So about 82% reduction, about a 63%

130
0:13:29,040 --> 0:13:37,680
reduction. But then when they looked at the delta variant, the odds ratio is 0.35 and 0.64. So about

131
0:13:37,680 --> 0:13:44,400
a 65% reduction, about a 36% reduction. So not working quite as well. There was an interesting

132
0:13:44,400 --> 0:13:49,840
comment. And I think that this is important and maybe plays into as people think about boosters.

133
0:13:50,640 --> 0:13:57,520
Transmission reductions declined over time since the second vaccination for delta reaching similar

134
0:13:57,520 --> 0:14:03,440
levels to unvaccinated by 12 weeks for Chadox and attenuating substantially for BioNTech

135
0:14:03,440 --> 0:14:10,080
162 B2, the Pfizer BioNTech. So protection from vaccination in contacts declined in the three

136
0:14:10,080 --> 0:14:15,840
months after second vaccination. So sort of this challenge, our vaccines are really great

137
0:14:16,560 --> 0:14:21,760
at preventing hospitalizations and severe disease. But how long are we going to get this

138
0:14:21,760 --> 0:14:27,040
impact on infection? How long are we going to get this impact on transmission reductions?

139
0:14:27,040 --> 0:14:35,040
I've also made several questions about a couple AstraZeneca products.

140
0:14:35,760 --> 0:14:43,920
The first one is the the the mabs that they have. And these are these long acting antibody

141
0:14:43,920 --> 0:14:54,240
therapies. So AstraZeneca's AZD7442, very catchy, requests for emergency authorization for COVID-19

142
0:14:54,240 --> 0:15:00,640
prophylaxis was filed in the US. So these are long acting monoclonals for prevention. And so

143
0:15:00,640 --> 0:15:09,840
this request was was based mainly on data from the ProVent trial, PROVEND trial, where 5197

144
0:15:09,840 --> 0:15:19,200
participants in a two to one randomization received this AZD7442, which has two mabs in there. And I'm

145
0:15:19,200 --> 0:15:23,120
not going to go into which they are because this has become a pronunciation challenge.

146
0:15:23,120 --> 0:15:31,280
And they compared this to placebo. And the primary analysis was based on 5172 participants

147
0:15:31,280 --> 0:15:38,880
who did not have SARS COVID-2 infection in baseline in this trial, 77% reduction in

148
0:15:38,880 --> 0:15:45,520
developing symptomatic COVID compared to placebo. So what's special here, right? And we've already

149
0:15:45,520 --> 0:15:51,280
talked about how Regen Cove can be used in the EUA and we will go through the details on that

150
0:15:51,280 --> 0:15:59,280
as a prophylactic. But here, this can be given IV or IM, right, as opposed to sub-Q. It's a little

151
0:15:59,280 --> 0:16:05,760
nicer to give this IM. This was actually gluteal. So this was given in the tail. There's also a

152
0:16:05,760 --> 0:16:11,520
longer half-life here. So these antibodies were optimized to have an extended half-life,

153
0:16:11,520 --> 0:16:18,720
reduced FC receptor and complement C1Q binding. And so they are actually suggesting that this

154
0:16:18,720 --> 0:16:25,760
can afford up to 12 months of protection following a single administration. So a lot of questions

155
0:16:25,760 --> 0:16:29,840
I'm getting from my colleagues who take care of individuals who are immune suppressed.

156
0:16:30,640 --> 0:16:35,120
We'll say cancer patients, patients with autoimmune disease, patients on immunosuppressive

157
0:16:35,120 --> 0:16:39,280
medications, patients that we do not think are going to get the protection that we would like

158
0:16:39,280 --> 0:16:45,920
from vaccinations or maybe even have a contraindication to vaccination. This is potentially a way of

159
0:16:45,920 --> 0:16:54,720
providing passive protection. A little exciting news on the testing front, right? We've sort of

160
0:16:54,720 --> 0:16:59,680
gone full circle and there's been a lot of folks embracing and really seeing the power of the

161
0:16:59,680 --> 0:17:07,120
rapid tests, but also the at-home rapid tests. So on the 4th of October, the US FDA issued another

162
0:17:07,120 --> 0:17:16,720
EUA for the ACON Laboratory's Flowflex COVID-19 home test. Per the manufacturer, they are planning

163
0:17:16,720 --> 0:17:22,720
and they claim they have the capacity to produce more than 100 million tests per month. They think

164
0:17:22,720 --> 0:17:30,720
they'll be able to ramp this up to 200 million per month by February 2022. So very exciting because

165
0:17:30,720 --> 0:17:34,960
right now, as we know, everyone's excited about home tests, but no one can get them. I even tried

166
0:17:34,960 --> 0:17:40,960
to do this myself. They are in short supply. And also, if you want to understand how to use these,

167
0:17:40,960 --> 0:17:46,560
because right, you're going to be swabbing yourself the same day the CDC updated their COVID

168
0:17:47,360 --> 0:17:53,040
self testing page where you can see some really nice infographics about how to stick that Q-tip

169
0:17:53,040 --> 0:17:59,440
up your nose and get these samples. I presume this is an antigen test, Daniel? Yes.

170
0:17:59,440 --> 0:18:09,200
Yeah. Is it going to be less than a dollar? Let's see if I have the money. Let's see if I have the

171
0:18:09,200 --> 0:18:15,040
cost here. I do not know what the cost is going to be, but will it be less than a dollar? The answer is

172
0:18:15,040 --> 0:18:25,360
no. Will it be maybe $5? Maybe, maybe. There is the potential that the US government will purchase

173
0:18:25,360 --> 0:18:31,360
a lot of these and then distribute them. So that could be, well, not quite free because we're paying

174
0:18:31,360 --> 0:18:38,000
our taxes. All right, active vaccination, you know, vaccines, the Jabs that keep you from getting

175
0:18:38,000 --> 0:18:43,360
sick. And I like to say vaccination is how this pandemic ends. I'm talking about those first doses.

176
0:18:43,360 --> 0:18:47,600
That's where we get our bag for our buck. In the New England Journal, we saw the peer read

177
0:18:47,600 --> 0:18:57,120
publication Phase 3, safety and efficacy of the Chad Ox 1 COVID-19 vaccine. And these are the

178
0:18:57,120 --> 0:19:03,120
finally, we're getting the peer reviewed publication of the ongoing results from the ongoing double

179
0:19:03,120 --> 0:19:09,120
blind randomized placebo controlled Phase 3 clinical trial, looking at the safety, vaccine

180
0:19:09,120 --> 0:19:16,400
efficacy, and immunogenicity of two doses of the AstraZeneca Chad Ox as compared with placebo

181
0:19:16,400 --> 0:19:21,440
in preventing is always important. What are we looking at the onset of symptomatic and severe

182
0:19:21,440 --> 0:19:28,480
COVID disease 2019 15 days or more after the second dose in adults, including older adults in the

183
0:19:28,480 --> 0:19:38,240
United States, Chile and Peru. In this trial, a total of 32,451 participants underwent randomization

184
0:19:38,240 --> 0:19:48,240
in a two to one ratio to receive this vaccine or placebo. So we had 21,635 versus placebo 10,816.

185
0:19:48,240 --> 0:19:57,200
And the overall vaccine efficacy for preventing symptomatic and severe was 74%. Interesting enough,

186
0:19:57,200 --> 0:20:05,920
the estimated vaccine efficacy for this endpoint was 83.5% in participants 65 years of age or older.

187
0:20:05,920 --> 0:20:11,840
They report that this high vaccine efficacy was consistent across a range of demographic

188
0:20:11,840 --> 0:20:19,120
subgroups. In the fully vaccinated analysis subgroup, they reported no severe or critical

189
0:20:19,120 --> 0:20:24,640
symptomatic COVID-19 cases. So that's, you know, you got to think about our endpoints. So that's

190
0:20:24,640 --> 0:20:32,160
a pretty excellent endpoint for looking at severe or critical disease 83.5 for symptomatic. So

191
0:20:32,160 --> 0:20:42,720
a pretty, pretty impressive data here. On October 4th in the Lancet, we saw another article. Again,

192
0:20:42,720 --> 0:20:51,120
on vaccines, effectiveness of mRNA, BNT, 162, B2, Pfizer, BioNTech, COVID-19 vaccine up to six months

193
0:20:51,120 --> 0:20:56,880
and a large integrated health system in the US, a retrospective cohort study. So this is a peer

194
0:20:56,880 --> 0:21:02,240
reviewed article. This is a retrospective cohort study where they analyzed electronic health

195
0:21:02,240 --> 0:21:09,520
records of individuals who are members of Kaiser Permanente, South California. They were looking

196
0:21:09,520 --> 0:21:17,200
at the effectiveness against infections and COVID-19 related hospital admissions for up to six months.

197
0:21:17,200 --> 0:21:23,040
So this is a, this is a very robust data set, right, by an organization that I'll say does an

198
0:21:23,040 --> 0:21:34,560
excellent job. 4,920,549 individuals were assessed for eligibility and ultimately 3,436,

199
0:21:35,120 --> 0:21:43,120
9,957 were included. So for fully vaccinated infections, they report fully vaccinated

200
0:21:43,120 --> 0:21:49,840
individuals, they report that effectiveness against infections declined from 88% during the first

201
0:21:49,840 --> 0:21:56,880
month to 47%. So that's effectiveness against infection. So among sequenced infections,

202
0:21:56,880 --> 0:22:02,320
vaccine efficacy, effectiveness against infections of the Delta variant was high during the forced

203
0:22:02,320 --> 0:22:10,000
month, 93%. And that went to 53% after four months, effectiveness against other variants,

204
0:22:10,000 --> 0:22:17,360
the first month, 97%, 67%, at four to five months. But what about vaccine effectiveness

205
0:22:17,360 --> 0:22:24,320
against hospital admissions for infections with the Delta variant, 93% up to six months.

206
0:22:25,280 --> 0:22:31,280
So I take away this as very encouraging. I know Pfizer vaccine has been getting a lot of bad press,

207
0:22:32,080 --> 0:22:36,560
you know, people are a little upset that they get the Pfizer and set of Moderna, but vaccine

208
0:22:36,560 --> 0:22:41,440
effectiveness against severe disease, right, hospital admissions with the Delta variant,

209
0:22:41,440 --> 0:22:45,840
93% for up to six months. So I found this rather encouraging.

210
0:22:45,840 --> 0:22:50,400
What about reinfection? I get a lot of questions about this.

211
0:22:51,200 --> 0:22:56,080
And so there's a lot of articles out there, but this article, the durability of immunity

212
0:22:56,080 --> 0:23:02,000
against reinfection by SARS-CoV-2, a comparative evolutionary study was published in the Lancet

213
0:23:02,000 --> 0:23:07,440
Microbe. So we certainly see reinfections, mainly starting about three months after infection and

214
0:23:07,440 --> 0:23:14,720
increasing over time. We know that if these folks get vaccinated, they can decrease their risk of

215
0:23:14,720 --> 0:23:22,640
infection by at least twofold. We're not sure one dose got us there, but two doses did in the MMWR

216
0:23:22,640 --> 0:23:27,760
publication we talked about. So if prior infection, we know that these individuals can get a benefit

217
0:23:27,760 --> 0:23:34,480
from vaccination. In this study, the authors looked at antibody data for six human infecting

218
0:23:34,480 --> 0:23:42,320
coronaviruses, extending from 128 days to 28 years after infection. This is a pretty broad

219
0:23:42,320 --> 0:23:50,800
study, infection between 1984 and 2020. They use this data to estimate profiles of the typical

220
0:23:50,800 --> 0:23:57,760
antibody decline and probabilities of reinfection over time under endemic conditions. They estimated

221
0:23:57,760 --> 0:24:04,720
that reinfection by SARS-CoV-2 under endemic conditions would likely occur between three months

222
0:24:04,720 --> 0:24:12,560
out to 5.1 years after the peak in the antibody response, suggesting a median of about 16 months.

223
0:24:13,520 --> 0:24:18,240
They calculated that this protection is less than half the duration revealed for the other

224
0:24:18,240 --> 0:24:27,040
endemic circulating coronaviruses. So OC43, NL63, 229E, if people have those remembered.

225
0:24:27,040 --> 0:24:32,080
But what I'm going to say for a deeper dive into the comparison between protection from infection

226
0:24:32,080 --> 0:24:39,120
versus vaccination, I'm going to recommend people go to 12, 813 discussion with Florian Kramer.

227
0:24:40,320 --> 0:24:47,200
It's really a popular topic that people are trying to sort out. But just to make it clear,

228
0:24:47,200 --> 0:24:53,040
we recommend that people who have been previously infected get the benefit of vaccination.

229
0:24:54,240 --> 0:24:59,040
A popular question now, I don't know if Vincent, if you are aware of this, but I keep getting,

230
0:24:59,040 --> 0:25:02,960
am I still considered fully vaccinated if I haven't had my booster?

231
0:25:04,240 --> 0:25:09,520
And straight from the CDC, yes, everyone is considered fully vaccinated two weeks after their

232
0:25:09,520 --> 0:25:16,320
second COVID vaccine in a two-shot series, or two weeks after a single dose vaccine for the

233
0:25:16,320 --> 0:25:21,520
J&J Janssen for those folks here in the US. So I've been getting a lot of employers,

234
0:25:21,520 --> 0:25:27,440
interesting enough, who are now demanding that their employees get a third dose,

235
0:25:27,440 --> 0:25:31,040
otherwise they're not considered fully vaccinated. But straight from the CDC,

236
0:25:31,040 --> 0:25:37,040
this is evolving, but at the moment, you're still good. I know we're up to 400,000 people

237
0:25:37,040 --> 0:25:44,560
getting a booster per day here in the US. So yeah, anyway, all right, passive vaccination.

238
0:25:44,560 --> 0:25:49,920
I want to remind people, remember monoclonals after high risk exposures and high risk people.

239
0:25:49,920 --> 0:25:56,800
We talked a little bit about AstraZeneca is applying for this, but we already have post-exposure

240
0:25:56,800 --> 0:26:04,560
prophylaxis as part of the EUA for Regen Cove. And who are the people that they are recommending

241
0:26:05,120 --> 0:26:11,040
eligible for post-exposure prophylaxis? These are individuals who are at high risk for progression

242
0:26:11,040 --> 0:26:16,080
to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death. These are folks who are either not

243
0:26:16,080 --> 0:26:22,960
fully vaccinated or are not expected to mount an adequate immune response to the SARS-CoV-2

244
0:26:22,960 --> 0:26:28,720
vaccination, right? So individuals with immunocompromising conditions, those on immunosuppressive

245
0:26:28,720 --> 0:26:35,360
medicines. So you're looking at individuals who have been exposed. But I also want to point out

246
0:26:35,360 --> 0:26:41,680
they also talk about for individuals in whom repeat dosing is considered because they continue

247
0:26:41,680 --> 0:26:49,600
to have ongoing exposure. So just a little bit of subtlety there. An individual who is immunosuppressed,

248
0:26:49,600 --> 0:26:54,720
who is not getting that protection from vaccine, but continues to be exposed over and over.

249
0:26:55,360 --> 0:27:01,600
The first dose is the 600, 600. But you can actually continue to dose them every four weeks

250
0:27:02,400 --> 0:27:08,880
with a 300 milligram, 300 milligram. And that can either be by subcutaneous injection. So in this

251
0:27:08,880 --> 0:27:13,440
sense, then we have to get two instead of four shots, or they can get an intravenous infusion

252
0:27:13,440 --> 0:27:19,920
every four weeks. For while we were stepping back a little on prophylaxis because of shortages,

253
0:27:19,920 --> 0:27:24,960
but as the numbers are going down, as we're getting improved access, we're stretching back

254
0:27:24,960 --> 0:27:31,920
out with the post-exposure prophylaxis. All right, the period of detectable viral replication,

255
0:27:31,920 --> 0:27:35,840
not the time for antibiotics, and not the time for steroids. We can do harm there.

256
0:27:36,960 --> 0:27:41,520
This is for a lot of people exciting. The beginning of a new era, Merck and Ridgeback

257
0:27:41,520 --> 0:27:46,880
announced the planned interim analysis results from the phase three move out trial, looking at

258
0:27:46,880 --> 0:27:54,640
the use of the oral antiviral. This is a pill, malnupiravir, in the early treatment of at-risk,

259
0:27:54,640 --> 0:28:01,760
non-hospitalized adult patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. So this was a planned interim

260
0:28:01,760 --> 0:28:09,120
analysis. They evaluated data from 775 patients who were initially enrolled in the trial, the phase

261
0:28:09,120 --> 0:28:15,600
three move out trial. And at the time of the decision to stop recruiting, the trial was approaching

262
0:28:15,600 --> 0:28:23,120
full recruitment, sample size of 1,550 patients with more than 90% of the intended sample size already

263
0:28:23,120 --> 0:28:28,960
enrolled. When they perform this interim analysis, and I want to point out, this is top line data.

264
0:28:28,960 --> 0:28:33,520
This is not peer reviewed. We don't have the details that will be coming forward. They reported

265
0:28:33,520 --> 0:28:41,680
in this study that malnupiravir reduced the risk of hospitalization or death by approximately

266
0:28:41,680 --> 0:28:52,400
50%. So we had 7.3% versus 14.1%. The little bit of sort of details here,

267
0:28:52,400 --> 0:28:58,400
in the individuals that received the antiviral, there were zero deaths. In the placebo group,

268
0:28:58,400 --> 0:29:04,000
there were eight deaths. So we're looking at zero versus 2%. So 2%, the expected mortality,

269
0:29:04,000 --> 0:29:10,800
zero percent in the folks that got this therapy. What about eligibility and timing? These

270
0:29:10,800 --> 0:29:17,120
individuals had to have laboratory confirmed COVID-19 with symptom onset within five days

271
0:29:17,120 --> 0:29:22,480
of study randomization, right? So a little bit longer than we would ideally want, right? Because

272
0:29:22,480 --> 0:29:27,600
you get randomized at day five may take you another day before you actually get the therapy.

273
0:29:27,600 --> 0:29:32,320
All the patients had to have at least one risk factor associated with poor disease outcome,

274
0:29:32,320 --> 0:29:39,760
right? So this is a slightly higher risk group. People did well, very well tolerated

275
0:29:40,560 --> 0:29:48,400
therapy. There is a recommendation to go ahead and look at possibly getting EUA. So we will find

276
0:29:48,960 --> 0:29:52,560
as we go forward. But just a little background, right? Because this is going to be one of the

277
0:29:52,560 --> 0:30:00,720
first drugs here that is being introduced. This is a RNA, dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor,

278
0:30:00,720 --> 0:30:07,040
right? That's something that we mammals don't have to worry about. There is going to be discussion

279
0:30:07,040 --> 0:30:11,840
about the safety of this drug. That's why it's going to go through the FDA. But this is really

280
0:30:11,840 --> 0:30:19,040
the first in this class going forward. We expect there to be another very similar drug. And we also

281
0:30:19,040 --> 0:30:25,200
expect another drug that we've talked about that's going to target the protease on the horizon. So

282
0:30:25,200 --> 0:30:30,240
fingers crossed, we're looking about three oral drugs being available by December. But I was

283
0:30:30,240 --> 0:30:33,360
going to, I was going to Vincent, do you want to make any comments at this point? I sort of thought

284
0:30:33,360 --> 0:30:39,760
this was an exciting bit of news. I think it's great that we these are in development. My only

285
0:30:39,760 --> 0:30:46,800
concern, and I'm sure as a physician who treats AIDS patients, Daniel, these will be initially

286
0:30:46,800 --> 0:30:51,040
used as monotherapy. And I'm just concerned that we're going to get rapid resistance,

287
0:30:51,040 --> 0:30:56,320
which will render them less useful. What do you think? Yeah. So I hopefully we've learned from

288
0:30:56,320 --> 0:31:02,960
the HIV. And we've also learned from influenza, right? Is that if you use these drugs all by

289
0:31:02,960 --> 0:31:07,600
themselves, you run a risk, particularly if they're used widely, which we're thinking they will be

290
0:31:07,600 --> 0:31:14,320
of inducing resistance. So I've already talked about the concept of maybe using this with maybe

291
0:31:14,320 --> 0:31:20,240
the protease inhibitor, maybe if we can use two drugs, we can put up a barrier to that resistance.

292
0:31:20,240 --> 0:31:27,120
So no, I think I think that's key. Anytime we use a drug, we we can end up with resistance. So it may

293
0:31:27,120 --> 0:31:31,360
be that we want to look at using two drugs that we're not pressuring and driving that.

294
0:31:32,640 --> 0:31:36,640
I worry particularly if people use this more than just as a five day therapy. What if you have

295
0:31:36,640 --> 0:31:39,920
a person who's immunosuppressed and you start using it for a longer period of time?

296
0:31:39,920 --> 0:31:45,200
But don't you have to trial them in combinations to get them approved that way?

297
0:31:45,200 --> 0:31:46,240
Yeah, we're going to have to do that.

298
0:31:48,160 --> 0:31:53,200
And this will be two different drug companies, three drug companies all like

299
0:31:53,200 --> 0:31:58,160
playing nicely working together. But it is interesting with HIV, we're often using

300
0:31:59,520 --> 0:32:04,080
three drug therapy. That's kind of the triple highly effective antiretroviral therapy,

301
0:32:04,800 --> 0:32:09,280
where often historically, it was three different companies were producing each

302
0:32:09,280 --> 0:32:15,840
of the different drugs in the cocktail. All right, timing. So we've got exciting

303
0:32:15,840 --> 0:32:22,320
stuff because the IDSA meeting was just recently. And so this was data that was presented there,

304
0:32:22,320 --> 0:32:27,360
and it was risk factor analysis for hospital admission following severe acute respiratory

305
0:32:27,360 --> 0:32:34,080
syndrome, coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2, monoclonal antibody treatment. And this was really looking

306
0:32:34,080 --> 0:32:40,320
at timing. If we get those monoclonals in earlier, does that give us better bang for our buck?

307
0:32:40,320 --> 0:32:45,680
So we look at this whole like less, you know, seven to 10 days after symptom onset, 70 to 80%

308
0:32:45,680 --> 0:32:50,640
reduction. But are we going to get even more reduction if we get them in the first few days?

309
0:32:50,640 --> 0:32:54,880
So here they're looking at patients that received what they say is early. So within

310
0:32:54,880 --> 0:33:00,480
days one through five of symptom onset and comparing those to people who received them late,

311
0:33:00,480 --> 0:33:07,680
six to 12. And so here we were seeing getting the MAB infusion in the first five days resulted

312
0:33:07,680 --> 0:33:16,560
in a 54% reduction in progression relative to those folks that get them late. So with the monoclonal

313
0:33:16,560 --> 0:33:22,240
timing matters, I know a lot of centers closed down over the weekend. A bit of a tragedy right

314
0:33:22,240 --> 0:33:27,520
person that's diagnosed on a Friday evening and they can't get treated until Monday or Tuesday,

315
0:33:27,520 --> 0:33:34,400
right? So we really need to focus on timing here of the patients that received the monoclonals

316
0:33:34,400 --> 0:33:40,960
in days one through three, none zero experienced disease progression. So sooner is better.

317
0:33:40,960 --> 0:33:47,440
We're hoping this translates in the oral antiretrovirals as well. See my antiretroviral slit,

318
0:33:47,440 --> 0:33:52,800
my world of HIV is coming back. But yeah, we're really hoping sooner can make more of a difference

319
0:33:52,800 --> 0:34:02,720
than later. All right, everybody, MISC, MISC, and MISC-A, remember those multi-system inflammatory

320
0:34:02,720 --> 0:34:08,800
syndrome? So we have actually finally got a little bit of guidance on treatment coming out

321
0:34:08,800 --> 0:34:16,960
in a publication of peer reviewed article, IVIG compared to IVIG plus inflexumab in multi-system

322
0:34:16,960 --> 0:34:22,080
inflammatory syndrome in children. This was published in pediatrics, the official journal

323
0:34:22,080 --> 0:34:28,720
of the American Academy of Pediatrics. This was a retrospective cohort study of 72 patients with

324
0:34:28,720 --> 0:34:35,920
MISC-C and they're looking at IVIG alone versus IVIG plus inflexumab, right? So this is going to

325
0:34:35,920 --> 0:34:42,320
neutralize the TNF alpha. Basically what I'm going to just nutshell this here, they were looking at

326
0:34:42,320 --> 0:34:50,800
better outcomes in the children that got remikade, the inflexumab added to their IVIG. They reported

327
0:34:50,800 --> 0:34:56,480
that patients with MISC-C compared to those with IVIG alone were less likely to require any

328
0:34:56,480 --> 0:35:03,040
additional therapy, decreased ICU length of stay, decreased development of left ventricular

329
0:35:03,040 --> 0:35:09,200
cardiac dysfunction, more rapid decline in their C-reactive protein, so following inflammatory markers.

330
0:35:10,400 --> 0:35:14,880
All right, a couple exciting things here on long COVID. I feel like I'm going a little long today.

331
0:35:14,880 --> 0:35:22,320
COVID is not just a two-week viral illness for many people. First, as of October 1st, we now have

332
0:35:22,320 --> 0:35:32,240
an official code for post acute sequelae of COVID-19. This is U09.9 post COVID-19 condition

333
0:35:32,240 --> 0:35:40,720
unspecified. Going forward, we'll have subsets. Also some exciting data on the impact of vaccination

334
0:35:40,720 --> 0:35:47,520
on long COVID, the article efficacy of COVID-19 vaccination on the symptoms of patients with

335
0:35:47,520 --> 0:35:56,000
long COVID, a target trial emulation using data from the COM pair, that's capital P capital R,

336
0:35:56,000 --> 0:36:03,440
E cohort in France. This was posted on Lancet as a pre-print. So the authors used data from this

337
0:36:03,440 --> 0:36:10,880
long COVID cohort. This was a cohort in France. Vaccinated patients were matched to unvaccinated

338
0:36:10,880 --> 0:36:17,280
controls in a one-to-one ratio by using their propensity scores. And they looked at outcomes

339
0:36:17,280 --> 0:36:24,720
120 days after baseline. They looked at the disease severity. So you have 455 patients in

340
0:36:24,720 --> 0:36:32,560
the vaccine group, 455 in the control group, and what did they find? They reported that by 120

341
0:36:32,560 --> 0:36:39,120
days, vaccination was associated with a reduction in long COVID symptoms. They saw double the rate

342
0:36:39,120 --> 0:36:45,920
of patients in complete remission. They saw a reduced disease impact on patients' lives

343
0:36:45,920 --> 0:36:51,920
and the proportion of patients with an unacceptable symptom score. So this is encouraging. Remember,

344
0:36:51,920 --> 0:36:58,240
this is, and we probably will never get a randomized placebo control trial. There's always the concern

345
0:36:58,240 --> 0:37:03,200
that there was some sort of a placebo effect. Also, people got vaccinated and unvaccinated.

346
0:37:03,200 --> 0:37:09,280
They're not exactly matched. But this is something that is consistent with our clinical experience,

347
0:37:10,000 --> 0:37:14,560
where we're treating hundreds, thousands of folks. And we're seeing this report

348
0:37:15,920 --> 0:37:22,560
encouraging. But what about Beckadysm, right? That's what we scientists care about. We do want

349
0:37:22,560 --> 0:37:27,280
our patients to get better, but we also like to know what is going on. And just, we're going to

350
0:37:27,280 --> 0:37:33,360
close with a couple articles on some insights into mechanisms. The peer-reviewed article,

351
0:37:33,360 --> 0:37:39,360
persistent clotting protein pathology in long COVID, post-acute sequelae of COVID-19, PASK

352
0:37:40,160 --> 0:37:45,360
is accompanied by increased levels of anti-plasmid. Now, this was published in the Journal

353
0:37:45,360 --> 0:37:51,520
Cardiovascular Diapatology. This is not a journal I usually read, and I'm not as familiar with some

354
0:37:51,520 --> 0:37:58,000
of the platelet activation studies that they did. But basically, going through the suggestion here

355
0:37:58,000 --> 0:38:05,440
was that hypercoagulability, a persistent hypercoagulability was being driven by inflammatory molecules,

356
0:38:05,440 --> 0:38:12,080
circulating microclots, hyperactivated platelets, issues with the fibrolinic system.

357
0:38:13,120 --> 0:38:18,320
And then the speculation here, which requires further study, is that with clotting pathologies

358
0:38:18,320 --> 0:38:24,080
involved, maybe some anti-clotting therapies can have an impact on long COVID. So hopefully,

359
0:38:24,080 --> 0:38:31,280
this will give us some sense of what to do going forward. COVID toes, right? Remember COVID toes?

360
0:38:31,280 --> 0:38:36,560
I have special socks with COVID toes. The article Type 1 Interferon Response and

361
0:38:36,560 --> 0:38:42,960
Vascular Alteration in Chilblain-like lesions during the COVID-19 outbreak was published in the

362
0:38:42,960 --> 0:38:49,920
British Journal of Dermatology. This was an observational study conducted 9 through 16 April

363
0:38:49,920 --> 0:38:58,880
2020 at Son-Louis Hospital in Paris, France. 50 patients referred with chilblain-like lesions

364
0:38:58,880 --> 0:39:05,600
were seen during the period of the COVID-19 pandemic included in this study. They were comparing the

365
0:39:05,600 --> 0:39:11,200
skin and blood endothelial and immune cell activation in the chilblain-like lesions

366
0:39:11,200 --> 0:39:18,640
in these COVID folks to seasonal chilblains that were cold-induced sporadic chilblains.

367
0:39:18,640 --> 0:39:24,560
They reported that they found chilblain-like lesions were characterized in the COVID folks,

368
0:39:24,560 --> 0:39:31,120
higher IgA tissue deposition, more significant transcriptomic activation of complement and

369
0:39:31,120 --> 0:39:38,640
angiogenesis factors. They reported systemic immune response associated with IgA anti-neutrophil,

370
0:39:38,640 --> 0:39:45,280
cytoplasmic antibodies and 73% of patients and elevated Type 1 interferon blood signature

371
0:39:45,920 --> 0:39:52,960
compared to healthy controls. They found blood biomarkers which they reported related to endothelial

372
0:39:52,960 --> 0:39:59,520
dysfunction and activation, angiogenesis, endothelial progenitor cell mobilization,

373
0:40:00,160 --> 0:40:05,760
really supporting in their analysis a role for endothelial dysfunction in the chilblain-like

374
0:40:05,760 --> 0:40:12,320
lesions. So very, very interesting. This is something that actually I think a lot of the nurses

375
0:40:12,320 --> 0:40:16,960
noticed early on. They're spending a little more time than the physicians looking at the

376
0:40:16,960 --> 0:40:22,080
patients, something that was seen in the outpatient setting as well. So just interesting that we're

377
0:40:22,080 --> 0:40:27,120
starting to get a little science to maybe help us understand. I like to close by saying no one

378
0:40:27,120 --> 0:40:31,920
is safe until everyone is safe. We are going to continue during the months of August, September

379
0:40:31,920 --> 0:40:38,400
and October to donations made to parasites without borders, doubled and going to support

380
0:40:38,400 --> 0:40:42,560
floating doctors with their efforts down in Central America. So drop what you're doing,

381
0:40:42,560 --> 0:40:48,160
go to parasiteswithoutborders.com, click on donate and help us continue to do our work

382
0:40:48,160 --> 0:40:53,680
and help us to support this organization. Time for some email questions for Daniel.

383
0:40:53,680 --> 0:41:00,240
You can send yours to Daniel at microbe.tv. Lisa is a nurse practitioner, a pediatric nurse

384
0:41:00,240 --> 0:41:06,080
practitioner who writes, I agree, kids are at risk. The decision made by adults responsible for

385
0:41:06,080 --> 0:41:10,400
protecting them. Sadly, too often put them at higher risk than they need to be. While numbers

386
0:41:10,400 --> 0:41:15,600
here in Florida are finally beginning to trend down, they remain much too high. We are in the middle

387
0:41:15,600 --> 0:41:23,920
of a mask debate with a local chiropractor handing out blank, signed medical mask exemptions after

388
0:41:23,920 --> 0:41:29,200
a very contentious school board meeting in which our county school board instituted a mask mandate

389
0:41:29,200 --> 0:41:35,040
in defiance of our governor's ban on this. Parents continue to show up in front of our

390
0:41:35,040 --> 0:41:41,440
schools with signs that making our kid wear masks is child abuse. Parents and children too often

391
0:41:41,440 --> 0:41:47,760
refuse to abide by our request that they wear masks in our office. And now our new state

392
0:41:47,760 --> 0:41:54,960
surgeon general who says he is rejecting fear over COVID mania has decided that as long as they

393
0:41:54,960 --> 0:41:58,960
are feeling well, our school children, many of whom of course are unable to be vaccinated or

394
0:41:58,960 --> 0:42:04,160
if they are able or not, no longer need the quarantine or test simply because they've been

395
0:42:04,160 --> 0:42:11,120
exposed to this pesky little virus. I am curious as to your opinion on this brilliant public health

396
0:42:11,120 --> 0:42:18,160
policy. Yeah, I'm horrified actually just to be frank. I mean, you know, when you see like the

397
0:42:18,160 --> 0:42:22,880
movies, right, there's always like the physician who can outrank the general, you can't do that

398
0:42:22,880 --> 0:42:29,520
because of this health issue and somehow in the real world. There's no under that outranking going

399
0:42:29,520 --> 0:42:36,320
on. Yes, 18 months ago, there was this myth that started to be spread that children were not

400
0:42:36,320 --> 0:42:41,280
at risk of COVID. Well, children don't get COVID. Well, they're not at risk of COVID. But now that

401
0:42:41,280 --> 0:42:47,200
we saw children getting exposed to COVID, we saw hundreds of thousands of children getting infected

402
0:42:47,200 --> 0:42:52,160
per week. We saw thousands of children ending up in the hospital. We see children, multiple

403
0:42:52,160 --> 0:42:57,200
children dying every week. There really has to be a certain point when you start off with no

404
0:42:57,200 --> 0:43:02,960
children are at risk of COVID, children can die of COVID, children can get hospitalized with COVID,

405
0:43:02,960 --> 0:43:10,400
children can develop long COVID with long term disabilities. Yes, this is a horrible thing to

406
0:43:10,400 --> 0:43:14,640
let happen to our children. And we don't really know what are going to be the long term effects

407
0:43:14,640 --> 0:43:20,720
of having been infected with this horrible virus. The second is we do know things that work,

408
0:43:20,720 --> 0:43:25,600
things that reduce our risk. You shouldn't have to choose between education and safety for your

409
0:43:25,600 --> 0:43:29,760
children. A child shouldn't have to choose between education and safety. We know how to keep our

410
0:43:29,760 --> 0:43:35,040
children safe. Wearing a mask is something that parents complain a lot more about than children.

411
0:43:35,600 --> 0:43:39,920
A lot of children actually kind of like the masks with the different designs and maybe it's become

412
0:43:39,920 --> 0:43:46,800
an accessory. I just really think we have to step back and take this out of the political arena.

413
0:43:46,800 --> 0:43:51,360
This is not a partisan issue. This is not a political thing. This should not be something that gets

414
0:43:51,360 --> 0:43:57,200
you reelected. What should get you reelected and what should get you support is protecting our

415
0:43:57,200 --> 0:44:01,520
children, helping them get educated safely. And we know how to do that. We keep talking about all

416
0:44:01,520 --> 0:44:07,120
the data behind that. Michelle writes, I'm in a quandary trying to decide what the best option

417
0:44:07,120 --> 0:44:12,960
for my daughter is. She turns 12 in January. She's 61 inches tall, 150 pounds. So she's the size

418
0:44:12,960 --> 0:44:18,160
of a small adult. She tends to school in which masks are only optional. Most kids are not wearing

419
0:44:18,160 --> 0:44:23,200
them. My concern is whether to get my daughter vaccinated in late fall with the children's dose

420
0:44:23,200 --> 0:44:30,720
or wait until January for the adult dose. Yeah, I mean, I have to say we've talked about this about

421
0:44:30,720 --> 0:44:34,560
this is perfect, right? Is that person right on the line? There's going to be no judgment. It's

422
0:44:34,560 --> 0:44:38,720
going to be this is the day it happens. But you know, this is even true with influenza. I have a

423
0:44:38,720 --> 0:44:45,120
colleague who's a hematology oncologist and he was turning city turned 65 today. So happy birthday

424
0:44:45,120 --> 0:44:51,920
Bruce. And Bruce went to get his hired dose because they're still using the egg based vaccine at the

425
0:44:51,920 --> 0:44:57,600
healthcare system. So he wanted to get the over 65 high dose because they're not using the cell

426
0:44:57,600 --> 0:45:02,880
based flu vaccine. And they said, I'm sorry, you know, it's Friday, your birthday is not until

427
0:45:02,880 --> 0:45:10,240
Thursday. You can't get it today. You'll have to come back when you turn 65. So it's interesting.

428
0:45:10,240 --> 0:45:15,520
People are pretty rigid about this stuff. The children all across look to be getting a really

429
0:45:15,520 --> 0:45:21,280
robust response with the lower dose. I would say don't don't wait. Don't miss an opportunity to

430
0:45:21,280 --> 0:45:26,640
vaccinate. Don't miss an opportunity to give your child that protection. If it turns out in the

431
0:45:26,640 --> 0:45:33,600
future, you know, boosters are recommended for, you know, individuals as we get more information

432
0:45:33,600 --> 0:45:39,520
about correlates of immunity. But yeah, let's I would encourage you to go ahead and when your

433
0:45:39,520 --> 0:45:48,080
child is eligible, go ahead and get the proper dose for that age. Daniel writes in New South Wales,

434
0:45:48,080 --> 0:45:53,040
Australia at the moment, there are a number of people in ICU and dying after full vaccination.

435
0:45:53,040 --> 0:45:58,080
I know this is to be expected. But I feel that discussion of this is avoided and leads my older

436
0:45:58,080 --> 0:46:02,560
friends, particularly to feel confused and helpless. All the people who have died here post

437
0:46:02,560 --> 0:46:08,640
vaccine have been in their 80s and 90s. They have also all had other underlying issues.

438
0:46:08,640 --> 0:46:13,520
But the underlying issues are never reported. My understanding of why this would occur at all

439
0:46:13,520 --> 0:46:18,800
is that the individual was unable to mount an immune response to the vaccine. Not that the

440
0:46:18,800 --> 0:46:25,360
vaccine has weakness, but the individual. Is this correct? Are these are there young healthy people

441
0:46:25,360 --> 0:46:31,520
who make no immune response and are protected for some reason? Is there a specific list of age

442
0:46:31,520 --> 0:46:36,880
plus underlying conditions that people can look at and clearly understand their level of risk?

443
0:46:38,720 --> 0:46:44,400
So yes, I actually feel like you're right on with this. We talked about the vaccines reducing

444
0:46:44,400 --> 0:46:49,360
your risk of death by, I'm going to say 30, right? We'll pick that as a number. You hate to pick one

445
0:46:49,360 --> 0:46:54,880
study, but that seems to be reasonable. So if you went from your risk, you're 90 years old,

446
0:46:54,880 --> 0:46:59,120
you're obese, you have diabetes, you have Down syndrome, right? Let's stack them all together.

447
0:46:59,120 --> 0:47:06,080
If your risk was 60% that you were going to die if you got COVID, well, that you take 60

448
0:47:06,080 --> 0:47:10,240
divided by 30, you still have a 2%. You still have a one in 50 chance of dying.

449
0:47:10,240 --> 0:47:16,880
My wife and I were talking yesterday, we're out walking the dogs. And I was saying, Jessica,

450
0:47:16,880 --> 0:47:23,440
when you get this reduction, so you've got your vaccine, you're now at 95% reduction

451
0:47:23,440 --> 0:47:28,480
for ending up in hospital, when you started off, you're in your 40s, your ideal body weight,

452
0:47:28,480 --> 0:47:32,800
you exercise, you have no, you started off with maybe a 1%, and now you're down to

453
0:47:32,800 --> 0:47:42,960
5% of 1%, incredibly low. So this is that risk reduction. People think, oh my gosh, 95% reduction.

454
0:47:42,960 --> 0:47:47,760
That means 5% of people are going to end up in the hospital. No, you have to take your baseline risk,

455
0:47:47,760 --> 0:47:53,360
and this is a reduction below that. So yes, we are going to see a couple people a day here in the

456
0:47:53,360 --> 0:47:58,960
US, right? Large country who are vaccinated and still end up dying, but we're going to see thousands

457
0:47:58,960 --> 0:48:02,960
who are unvaccinated end up in the hospital and dying. We're also going to see a certain

458
0:48:02,960 --> 0:48:07,840
percent of people who are vaccinated end up in the hospital, but that's going to be a 30-fold,

459
0:48:07,840 --> 0:48:14,160
or a 10-fold reduction in that number. So that's really, you're really hitting right on it.

460
0:48:14,160 --> 0:48:19,200
This is a reduction in baseline risk. So yeah, who are going to be those people who still end

461
0:48:19,200 --> 0:48:23,120
up in the hospital? It's going to be predominantly older individuals. It's going to be predominantly

462
0:48:23,120 --> 0:48:28,320
individuals with a lot of comorbidities. And those people that do die, they're going to be those

463
0:48:28,320 --> 0:48:36,160
individuals who have the highest risk factors. And finally, Helen is the parent of a 34-year-old

464
0:48:36,160 --> 0:48:42,720
adult with down. She has had two Pfizer vaccines, wondering if there are any data on how well people

465
0:48:42,720 --> 0:48:48,160
would down respond to the vaccines. The order is in a day program where everyone's vaccinated,

466
0:48:48,160 --> 0:48:53,600
but she's still concerned. Yeah, no, that's an excellent question. And I think you hit on one of

467
0:48:53,600 --> 0:48:59,120
the things that I touched on there. A down syndrome is a significant risk factor for hospitalization

468
0:48:59,120 --> 0:49:03,920
and death. I think it's about a 10-fold. It was a British medical journal article in September,

469
0:49:03,920 --> 0:49:07,920
where they were looking at these. Actually, it's a great article, British medical journal. I think

470
0:49:07,920 --> 0:49:12,240
it was the 17th of September, the article came out, where they were looking at all these different

471
0:49:12,240 --> 0:49:17,840
factors. Down syndrome was about a 10-fold increase risk of death. So when they talked about populations

472
0:49:17,840 --> 0:49:22,400
that they felt were at increased risk, when they started talking about the Pfizer booster,

473
0:49:22,400 --> 0:49:28,000
down syndrome was one of those thrown in there. So yeah, individuals with all these different

474
0:49:28,000 --> 0:49:32,720
comorbidities, particularly down syndrome are at increased risk. What about response to the

475
0:49:32,720 --> 0:49:38,160
vaccine? I haven't really seen any really good data looking specifically at individuals with

476
0:49:38,160 --> 0:49:41,920
the down syndrome response, but put it in that context of the overall risk.

477
0:49:43,440 --> 0:49:49,040
That's COVID-19 clinical update number 83 with Dr. Daniel Griffin. Thank you, Daniel.

478
0:49:49,040 --> 0:49:54,240
Oh, thank you. And be safe. And I say that to all those kids have to go to school without masks.

479
0:49:54,240 --> 0:50:19,680
Be as safe as you can.
