0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:06,960
This week in virology, the podcast about viruses, the kind that make you sick.

2
0:00:10,400 --> 0:00:21,120
From Microbe TV, this is Twiv, this week in virology, episode 780, recorded on July 15th, 2021.

3
0:00:21,760 --> 0:00:27,840
I'm Vincent Draconiello, and you're listening to the podcast all about viruses. Joining me today

4
0:00:27,840 --> 0:00:36,080
from New York, Daniel Griffin. Hello, everyone. Daniel, this is update number 71. What's going on

5
0:00:36,080 --> 0:00:44,640
here in New York City? You know, there's a lot of stuff going on and not great stuff going on,

6
0:00:44,640 --> 0:00:50,640
so I'm going to jump right in with my quotation and then I'm going to give the update because

7
0:00:50,640 --> 0:00:54,320
things are headed in the wrong direction. Maybe we'll talk a little bit about why.

8
0:00:54,320 --> 0:01:01,040
So, in questions of science, the authority of a thousand is not worth the humble reasoning

9
0:01:01,040 --> 0:01:09,600
of a single individual. And that's Galileo, 1632. He was Italian. Wasn't he Italian Vincent?

10
0:01:09,600 --> 0:01:14,560
He was. And I think revered in his time, right?

11
0:01:17,120 --> 0:01:23,280
Well, by some, not by everyone. A lot of people thought he was heretical to propose that the

12
0:01:23,280 --> 0:01:29,200
Earth was round and all of that stuff. Yeah, and the whole thing's not revolving around the Earth

13
0:01:29,200 --> 0:01:34,160
to move away from an Earth-centric world to view. Yeah, he got death threats, for sure, right?

14
0:01:35,040 --> 0:01:40,640
Yeah, so maybe some of our colleagues are having similar treatment today.

15
0:01:42,000 --> 0:01:45,920
I think we're all locked in our towers, right? So, a lot of parallels here.

16
0:01:45,920 --> 0:01:53,280
But the reason I bring that up is I know, Vincent, you really are a leader in this,

17
0:01:53,280 --> 0:02:00,800
but I try to do this as well. I want to share what the science says and not just echo what so many

18
0:02:00,800 --> 0:02:10,720
people are saying. If you say it 10 times, it does not make it any more true. So, what is going on?

19
0:02:10,720 --> 0:02:16,880
We are seeing an uptick. And you can read the same article with just a different title.

20
0:02:17,600 --> 0:02:21,840
What is this being driven by? It's being driven by the virus. It's being driven by behavior.

21
0:02:22,480 --> 0:02:29,520
But we're also seeing some other new developments. I just want to give people a sense. The amount

22
0:02:29,520 --> 0:02:36,400
of COVID we're seeing across the country is increasing. My buddy, Poe, out at the Everett Clinic in

23
0:02:36,400 --> 0:02:43,440
Washington, went for quite a while, not seeing much. And we talked on Monday. He was now seeing

24
0:02:43,440 --> 0:02:49,360
30, 40 a day. I was on the phone earlier today with a friend of mine, Adam Fitterstein,

25
0:02:50,240 --> 0:02:57,760
who runs our urgent care centers in the New York area, under Bonnie Simmons as his boss.

26
0:02:58,480 --> 0:03:04,160
And he was saying he went many days without seeing COVID. Now he's seeing 10 or 12 a day.

27
0:03:04,160 --> 0:03:08,800
There's a little bit of a twist on this. I'm seeing some interesting

28
0:03:10,080 --> 0:03:16,160
situations. I'm just going to share a couple stories. The first one was a colleague of mine,

29
0:03:16,160 --> 0:03:25,600
a physician, fully vaccinated, maybe enjoying himself a little bit more than I do.

30
0:03:26,160 --> 0:03:30,160
Maybe not taking me to any precautions. Ended up starting to feel not well,

31
0:03:30,160 --> 0:03:35,600
tested positive for COVID. So had a mild outpatient experience with COVID,

32
0:03:36,400 --> 0:03:41,200
but then actually brought it home to his spouse. And so then his spouse had COVID.

33
0:03:42,160 --> 0:03:46,960
Also, his spouse was vaccinated. So another it was another mild case. So one vaccinated person

34
0:03:46,960 --> 0:03:53,520
getting infected, spreading it to another vaccinated person. In this case, both were mild.

35
0:03:53,520 --> 0:04:00,400
Another story was a dad. And this is actually a friend of mine, not a clinician. He does

36
0:04:00,400 --> 0:04:08,960
something else for a living. And he started to feel crummy right about July 4th, right? July 4th is

37
0:04:08,960 --> 0:04:15,120
sort of a target date here. Went and got tested. He was fully vaccinated. And to his surprise,

38
0:04:15,120 --> 0:04:21,920
he tested positive for COVID. And then his son, who's below the age of 12, started to feel not

39
0:04:21,920 --> 0:04:30,160
great and also tested positive for COVID. So it's interesting. We have a lot of ideas about early

40
0:04:30,160 --> 0:04:35,440
on after vaccination, having really high antibody levels, maybe keeping people from getting infected,

41
0:04:35,440 --> 0:04:40,880
keeping people from transmitting. But now we're starting to get six months out from those early

42
0:04:40,880 --> 0:04:47,120
vaccinations. Are we starting to see this because of waning antibody levels? Are we starting to see

43
0:04:47,120 --> 0:04:52,960
this because of changes in behavior, right? So I just want to share those stories just in case

44
0:04:52,960 --> 0:04:57,600
people have a question. If you're vaccinated, can you get COVID? Yes. If you're vaccinated,

45
0:04:57,600 --> 0:05:02,560
can you get COVID and spread it to other people? Well, there's just two real life examples

46
0:05:03,840 --> 0:05:09,440
in addition to the science I've shared in the past. But the majority of infections are

47
0:05:09,440 --> 0:05:17,840
presumably an unvaccinated people, right? It is completely true. And not only are the infections

48
0:05:17,840 --> 0:05:25,280
predominantly in unvaccinated individuals, but looking around 99% of the admissions

49
0:05:25,280 --> 0:05:31,040
are in unvaccinated individuals. So just to repeat that, vaccinations are huge at protecting

50
0:05:31,040 --> 0:05:37,360
you from serious disease and hospitalizations. 99% of the people that end up in the hospital

51
0:05:37,360 --> 0:05:45,280
that are dying from COVID over 99% are unvaccinated. So get vaccinated if I haven't mentioned that

52
0:05:45,280 --> 0:05:51,680
before. I feel like I may have. Now, there's there's a lot of pressure I know to keep up each week

53
0:05:51,680 --> 0:05:57,680
in terms of what's happening with COVID. I had like a nightmare the other night. I was, you know,

54
0:05:57,680 --> 0:06:01,840
being asked a question and something new had come out in the last hour and I did not know about it.

55
0:06:01,840 --> 0:06:10,240
So I woke up in a cold sweat. Yeah, it was not COVID. It was just, you know, I don't know what it is.

56
0:06:10,240 --> 0:06:16,480
But my hope with these weekly clinical updates is to take some of the pressure off our busy

57
0:06:16,480 --> 0:06:20,800
clinicians and listeners. And my commitment continues to be that if there's something really

58
0:06:20,800 --> 0:06:27,600
critical that you need to know, I'm going to make sure that I bring it up in my clinical update.

59
0:06:27,600 --> 0:06:33,440
And for a deeper dive, I want people to keep listening to Vincent and the crew on the other

60
0:06:33,440 --> 0:06:38,880
Twiv episodes. It really is important. I think we went into this. Why do I need to know so much

61
0:06:38,880 --> 0:06:44,720
about viruses? I think that most people have realized that you need to know a lot about viruses.

62
0:06:45,440 --> 0:06:50,880
And the more we know, hopefully the longer period of time before we have something like this and

63
0:06:50,880 --> 0:06:56,320
hopefully we'll do better the next time. All right. And I will try to keep this, you know,

64
0:06:56,320 --> 0:07:03,360
at my 30 minutes. But this was an exciting last week. We got updated school and child care guidance

65
0:07:03,360 --> 0:07:10,160
from the CDC. This is the much awaited K through 12 school guidance. And I'm going to go through

66
0:07:10,160 --> 0:07:15,760
that part of this in some detail. And I will, don't worry as I go through this, I'm also going

67
0:07:15,760 --> 0:07:20,560
to return to the hot button issues because I have realized as I've discussed this, there are some.

68
0:07:20,560 --> 0:07:29,200
So number one, the CDC has come out. Students benefit from in-person learning and safely

69
0:07:29,200 --> 0:07:36,800
returning to in-person instruction in the fall 2021 is a priority. And so I've been saying this

70
0:07:36,800 --> 0:07:40,640
for a long time. A lot of us have been saying this. The CDC is really stepping up and saying

71
0:07:41,200 --> 0:07:47,440
school is a priority. Number two, right here at the top of the list, vaccination is currently the

72
0:07:47,440 --> 0:07:54,320
leading public health prevention strategy to end the COVID-19 pandemic. Remember, we're ending the

73
0:07:54,320 --> 0:08:00,000
pandemic. We have realized we will never get rid of COVID-19. This is going to be part of our life.

74
0:08:00,000 --> 0:08:06,400
But in the same comment, promoting vaccination can help schools safely return to in-person learning

75
0:08:06,400 --> 0:08:12,320
as well as extracurricular activities and sports. Now, I know it's a little bit of a hot button

76
0:08:12,320 --> 0:08:16,960
issue. People have said, you know, the schools need to open. It's number one priority. There

77
0:08:16,960 --> 0:08:23,440
should be no qualifications. There should be no rules. Just make it happen. We'll get into this

78
0:08:23,440 --> 0:08:27,600
a little bit more. There are ways to do this safely. And I'm going to go through the science

79
0:08:27,600 --> 0:08:34,080
behind these recommendations. Next, and this is the hot button issue. Masks should be worn indoors

80
0:08:34,080 --> 0:08:41,120
by all individuals, age two and older, who are not fully vaccinated. Consistent and correct

81
0:08:41,120 --> 0:08:47,520
masks used by persons who are not fully vaccinated. People who are not fully vaccinated is especially

82
0:08:47,520 --> 0:08:52,480
important indoors and in crowded settings when physical distancing cannot be maintained.

83
0:08:53,280 --> 0:08:59,200
And I'm going to get back to that because not everyone is happy about masks. I don't know if

84
0:08:59,200 --> 0:09:06,720
people have noticed. The CDC recommends schools maintain at least three feet of physical distance

85
0:09:06,720 --> 0:09:11,360
between students within classrooms combined with indoor mask wearing by people who are

86
0:09:11,360 --> 0:09:16,720
not fully vaccinated to reduce transmission risk. This is when it gets a little touchy for some

87
0:09:16,720 --> 0:09:21,440
people when it is not possible to maintain a physical distance of at least three feet,

88
0:09:21,440 --> 0:09:26,880
such as when schools cannot fully reopen while maintaining these distances. It is especially

89
0:09:26,880 --> 0:09:32,400
important to layer multiple other prevention strategies, such as mentioned indoor masking.

90
0:09:32,400 --> 0:09:38,160
So what they're saying here is if you can't get that three feet, if that's going to prevent you

91
0:09:38,160 --> 0:09:43,120
from opening, do not prevent it from opening, you got to open, we're going to use a multi-layered

92
0:09:43,120 --> 0:09:48,800
strategy. You got to get those schools open as the push from the CDC. Screening testing.

93
0:09:49,680 --> 0:09:56,480
Don't forget testing, screening testing, ventilation, hand washing and respiratory etiquette, staying

94
0:09:56,480 --> 0:10:02,560
home when sick and getting tested, contact tracing in combination with quarantine and isolation and

95
0:10:02,560 --> 0:10:07,840
cleaning and disinfection are also important layers of prevention to keep schools safe.

96
0:10:08,480 --> 0:10:13,600
So remember, these are layers. These are lots of things adding up to achieve that safe environment.

97
0:10:14,480 --> 0:10:19,680
Students, teachers and staff should stay home when they have signs of any infectious illness

98
0:10:19,680 --> 0:10:26,000
and be referred to their health care provider for testing and care. This should have seen to me

99
0:10:26,000 --> 0:10:31,280
like an obvious thing for many years. COVID is bringing this out. You send sick people to a school.

100
0:10:32,080 --> 0:10:38,080
What do we think is going to happen? Now, this many school served children under the age of 12

101
0:10:38,080 --> 0:10:43,680
who are not eligible for vaccination at this time. Therefore, this guidance emphasizes

102
0:10:43,680 --> 0:10:50,000
the implemented layered prevention strategies. COVID-19 prevention strategies remain critical

103
0:10:50,000 --> 0:10:54,960
to protect people, including students, teachers, staff who are not fully vaccinated, especially

104
0:10:54,960 --> 0:11:00,800
in areas of moderate to high community transmission levels. And finally, locality should monitor

105
0:11:00,800 --> 0:11:06,400
community transmission, vaccination coverage, screening testing and occurrence of outbreaks

106
0:11:06,400 --> 0:11:12,640
to guide decisions on the level of the layered prevention strategies. And this is all available

107
0:11:12,640 --> 0:11:20,560
to go through even in more detail at the CDC site. But as I mentioned going through this,

108
0:11:20,560 --> 0:11:25,040
there are a couple hot button issues. So let me talk a little bit about the science

109
0:11:25,840 --> 0:11:31,440
behind this multilayered approach that includes masks, improved ventilation,

110
0:11:31,440 --> 0:11:36,800
testing and vaccination in children. And the CDC, in addition to this guidance, they actually

111
0:11:36,800 --> 0:11:45,600
have a science brief. And this is science brief transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in K through 12 schools

112
0:11:45,600 --> 0:11:52,640
and early care and education programs. And this was updated July 9th. So this is the CDC's attempt

113
0:11:52,640 --> 0:11:57,680
to communicate the science that is driving these recommendations. And I do encourage people to

114
0:11:57,680 --> 0:12:04,400
look at this information. I was having a discussion just yesterday with friend of mine, Dr. Lucy McBride,

115
0:12:04,400 --> 0:12:08,800
you know, and she was asking like, well, what is the science behind these recommendations?

116
0:12:08,800 --> 0:12:15,680
So let me go through. What is the science? I mean, the CDC is a science driven organization.

117
0:12:15,680 --> 0:12:21,680
They're not going with hunches. And these are the four points that they base this on. One,

118
0:12:21,680 --> 0:12:27,920
children and adolescents can be infected with SARS-CoV-2, can get sick with COVID-19,

119
0:12:27,920 --> 0:12:34,480
and can spread the virus to others. So those are true. That's not something we can just deny.

120
0:12:34,480 --> 0:12:42,160
Two, several studies conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic suggested that the incidence rate among

121
0:12:42,160 --> 0:12:48,320
children and adolescents was lower than among adults. So remember, low, but not no risk. However,

122
0:12:48,320 --> 0:12:53,440
the lower incidence rates may have been due in part two children when compared to adults,

123
0:12:53,440 --> 0:12:59,680
having fewer opportunities for exposure. And I do really want to point this out. People say,

124
0:12:59,680 --> 0:13:05,360
oh, only about 500 children died in the last year. When we had them locked away,

125
0:13:05,360 --> 0:13:11,120
not able to go to school, not able to engage in all these activities, what happens when you

126
0:13:11,120 --> 0:13:16,720
start having children with the same exposure opportunities, it's an odd wording, exposure

127
0:13:16,720 --> 0:13:23,760
opportunities that adults have had. Point number three, although rates of severe outcomes,

128
0:13:23,760 --> 0:13:30,000
for instance, hospitalization and mortality from COVID-19 among children and adolescents are low,

129
0:13:30,720 --> 0:13:36,080
youth who belong to some racial and ethnic minority groups are disproportionately affected,

130
0:13:37,040 --> 0:13:44,880
similar to adults, and COVID-19 deaths among persons aged 5 to 17 years, 120 deaths among,

131
0:13:44,880 --> 0:13:52,000
let me say that again, 71 COVID-19 deaths among persons aged 5 to 17. We saw 120 deaths among

132
0:13:52,000 --> 0:13:57,360
those aged 0 to 4. Those were all reported to the National Center for Health Statistics through

133
0:13:57,360 --> 0:14:04,960
July 7. So just to point out, that was reducing these exposures to the children. We still were

134
0:14:04,960 --> 0:14:11,040
seeing deaths. The CDC doesn't go into this, but I will point out there's also the issue of long

135
0:14:11,040 --> 0:14:16,640
COVID. We've now we've focused too narrowly in adults, but also in children on just deaths and

136
0:14:16,640 --> 0:14:21,760
hospitalization. Think about all the children we've talked about with cardiac manifestations,

137
0:14:21,760 --> 0:14:29,360
with long COVID, who months after COVID are still not back normal. All right, number four, studies

138
0:14:29,360 --> 0:14:35,360
of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in schools that consistently implemented layered prevention strategies

139
0:14:35,360 --> 0:14:40,640
have shown success in limiting transmission in schools. And I'm going to go through a little bit

140
0:14:40,640 --> 0:14:46,000
of the science here. And I do want to point out there is lots of science behind these recommendations.

141
0:14:46,000 --> 0:14:52,240
These recommendations are based on about 100 peer-reviewed publications that one can access

142
0:14:52,240 --> 0:14:58,480
and read on the CDC site. So we've talked about some of these studies before. One was the study

143
0:14:58,480 --> 0:15:04,320
that we talked about in the end of May. It was a study of 11 school districts in North Carolina

144
0:15:04,320 --> 0:15:09,920
with in-person learning for at least nine weeks during the fall 2020 semester. And they reported

145
0:15:09,920 --> 0:15:14,800
minimal school-related transmission, even while community transmission was high.

146
0:15:14,800 --> 0:15:21,200
Now these schools implemented and strictly adhere to multiple prevention strategies including

147
0:15:21,200 --> 0:15:27,440
universal mask use, physical distancing. Now breaches and mask use likely explain the few

148
0:15:27,440 --> 0:15:33,440
instances of in-school spread of SARS-CoV-2. So I want to point this out. This is kind of an

149
0:15:33,440 --> 0:15:41,200
interesting issue. And I know I've gotten some less than friendly comments from parents. We can

150
0:15:41,200 --> 0:15:47,360
actually keep children safer in school, give them the social and educational interaction that is

151
0:15:47,360 --> 0:15:53,760
critical. Compared to if they stay home and they're socially isolated, at some point they're going

152
0:15:53,760 --> 0:15:57,840
to get together with their friends. They're going to get together in a suburban home, which is a

153
0:15:57,840 --> 0:16:04,320
high-risk environment. So just really good example here. Another study of elementary schools in Utah.

154
0:16:04,320 --> 0:16:09,360
Maybe people remember this one. This is where they implemented layered prevention strategies,

155
0:16:09,360 --> 0:16:15,120
such as mask wearing, cohorting. And they found very low transmission, secondary attack rate

156
0:16:15,120 --> 0:16:21,440
of less than 1%. I don't think we talked about this one, but the study of the K through 12 schools

157
0:16:21,440 --> 0:16:28,240
in St. Louis. Again, multi-layered prevention strategies in place. Only 2% of the contacts of

158
0:16:28,240 --> 0:16:35,120
the COVID-19 cases tested positive for the virus. This was again in a context of very high community

159
0:16:35,120 --> 0:16:42,800
transmission rates. We have a nice study out of Italy that they reference. They reference a study

160
0:16:42,800 --> 0:16:50,080
in Swiss schools, a German school. And then they sort of finish off their discussion with a study

161
0:16:50,080 --> 0:16:56,240
of private schools that reopened for in-person instruction in Chicago with the implementation of

162
0:16:56,240 --> 0:17:01,840
the layered prevention strategy. And again, minimal in-school transmission. So I do want to point

163
0:17:01,840 --> 0:17:08,480
out this is evidence-based. The CDC is not being whimsical here. We do want those kids in school.

164
0:17:10,000 --> 0:17:16,080
And I will just throw one quick scenario, which I encountered today. It was an outdoor learning

165
0:17:16,080 --> 0:17:22,800
environment. It was school, young kids. And they spent most of the day outside. But then what they

166
0:17:22,800 --> 0:17:29,920
do is they have snack time indoors. So they all go indoors, unmasked, sit around these tables. And

167
0:17:29,920 --> 0:17:34,080
one of the kids had COVID. So what do you think happened? And I was like, why can't they just

168
0:17:34,080 --> 0:17:39,200
have snack time outdoors? Be separated apart. Then there wouldn't have been this exposure. There

169
0:17:39,200 --> 0:17:45,520
wouldn't be a shutdown of the venue for 10 days. So I want to bring up not only can we keep kids

170
0:17:45,520 --> 0:17:50,880
safe, but we can also keep them there in school, not in and out of quarantine and isolation.

171
0:17:51,840 --> 0:17:57,760
All right. Pre-exposure period transmission testing. Never miss an opportunity to test.

172
0:17:57,760 --> 0:18:04,880
Rates are rising as I pointed out. These rates are going to keep rising into the fall and the

173
0:18:04,880 --> 0:18:11,840
winter. We need to keep testing. And we had a nice article comparing the diagnostic accuracy

174
0:18:11,840 --> 0:18:18,800
of point of care, lateral flow antigen testing for SARS-CoV-2 with RT-PCR in primary care. This

175
0:18:18,800 --> 0:18:24,400
was the REAP-2 study for those that were following this. It was published in the Lancet publication

176
0:18:24,400 --> 0:18:30,720
E Clinical Medicine. And I think this was well done taking what we know about rapid testing.

177
0:18:31,280 --> 0:18:37,360
This is a great diagnostic test early in disease in symptomatic individuals. And in this study,

178
0:18:37,360 --> 0:18:47,120
they looked at 2,562 patients with mild to moderate influenza-like symptoms. That classic

179
0:18:47,760 --> 0:18:52,240
that we think about with COVID, but we think about with a spectrum of other respiratory diseases.

180
0:18:52,240 --> 0:18:59,920
You know, fever, malaise, cough. This was a general practice network in an Austrian district.

181
0:18:59,920 --> 0:19:07,280
They were looking at October 22 to November 30, 2020. And all of these individuals, these

182
0:19:07,280 --> 0:19:16,480
patients received a clinical assessment, including both a lateral flow rapid test, so an LFT. And then

183
0:19:16,480 --> 0:19:22,640
all the patients that had suspected COVID-19 also went on to get that RT-PCR testing.

184
0:19:22,640 --> 0:19:28,560
And they reported in this cohort an overall sensitivity for the rapid antigen test in the

185
0:19:28,560 --> 0:19:37,200
acute illness of 95.4% with a specificity of 89.1%. They talk about positive predictive value,

186
0:19:37,840 --> 0:19:43,280
but I'm not going to actually mention that, because as we all know, the sensitivity specificity

187
0:19:43,280 --> 0:19:49,360
gets coupled with the prevalence, the pretest probability. So I'm going to leave it with that.

188
0:19:49,360 --> 0:19:55,040
If you have a low pretest probability, if you have a low prevalence in your community,

189
0:19:55,040 --> 0:20:00,480
that's going to impact the translation of your sensitivity and specificity into positive

190
0:20:00,480 --> 0:20:05,040
predictive values. But what I will also say, and I thought this was really nice,

191
0:20:05,040 --> 0:20:09,840
they had information on my favorite value. What is my favorite value? The CT value,

192
0:20:09,840 --> 0:20:14,800
the cycle threshold values. And they reported what we would expect,

193
0:20:14,800 --> 0:20:20,160
our listeners are thinking, do you think those people that had positive PCRs but a negative

194
0:20:20,160 --> 0:20:25,920
rapid, perhaps they had really high CT values and low viral loads? Yes, that was exactly.

195
0:20:26,800 --> 0:20:32,800
The rapid testing was strongly associated with CT values less than 30, and the duration of

196
0:20:32,800 --> 0:20:37,520
symptoms being in those first three days. So those first three days, the high level of

197
0:20:37,520 --> 0:20:43,520
RNA, that's when we're picking these people up. This is when we're picking up people who are

198
0:20:44,480 --> 0:20:49,600
transmitting the virus or capable of transmitting the virus. And I'm going to throw a little story.

199
0:20:49,600 --> 0:20:54,080
I think people like our stories. This was a sporting, a recent sporting event where they

200
0:20:54,080 --> 0:20:59,200
brought people into a cohort. They did all the right things. They tested people, you know, 72

201
0:20:59,200 --> 0:21:03,840
hours ahead of time. They tested them when they got in. And then day five, someone started to feel

202
0:21:03,840 --> 0:21:10,240
ill. They tested everyone, one person, that symptomatic person was positive. Another person was PCR

203
0:21:10,240 --> 0:21:14,560
positive. But in the high thirties, they pulled those two individuals out, and that was the end

204
0:21:14,560 --> 0:21:21,280
of the spread. So think about different testing, serving different roles. Active vaccination,

205
0:21:22,000 --> 0:21:25,840
we had a bit going on in this realm. I thought this was going to be quiet, but no,

206
0:21:26,400 --> 0:21:31,840
the never miss an opportunity to vaccinate and vaccination is how this pandemic ends.

207
0:21:31,840 --> 0:21:40,960
The FDA updated the J and J vaccine EUA to include Guillain-Barre syndrome. Reports of adverse

208
0:21:40,960 --> 0:21:47,920
events following use of the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine under emergency authorization suggest an

209
0:21:47,920 --> 0:21:53,920
increased risk of Guillain-Barre syndrome during the 42 days following vaccination.

210
0:21:54,880 --> 0:21:59,840
And they're suggesting that this may be a rate of about two to three million to two to three

211
0:21:59,840 --> 0:22:06,880
per million versus a background rate in the population of about one million. So when last,

212
0:22:06,880 --> 0:22:12,880
we hear they're looking at about 100 individuals. The nice thing about the media getting this out

213
0:22:12,880 --> 0:22:19,520
here is now clinicians and patients can report this to VAERS, the vaccine adverse event reporting

214
0:22:19,520 --> 0:22:24,480
system, and actually got a call yesterday from a neurologist colleague of mine who said, you know,

215
0:22:24,480 --> 0:22:28,800
I got a call from a patient. Is there a connection here with Guillain-Barre? I just diagnosed this

216
0:22:28,800 --> 0:22:35,120
individual with Guillain-Barre and about 40 days prior they had gotten their J and J vaccine. So

217
0:22:35,120 --> 0:22:40,080
this is going to help us make that connection. I do want to point out we're talking about, you

218
0:22:40,080 --> 0:22:47,360
know, a rate to three per million. So again, as I always like to say, you are making a decision

219
0:22:47,360 --> 0:22:51,600
between whether you're going to get vaccinated or since COVID is going to be with us, you're going

220
0:22:51,600 --> 0:22:58,320
to get COVID. We saw Guillain-Barre with COVID. We see Guillain-Barre with COVID at a much higher

221
0:22:58,320 --> 0:23:06,000
rate than with vaccine parallel here with influenza. We also got some interim immunogenicity and efficacy

222
0:23:06,000 --> 0:23:14,320
data for the AD26 COVID-2 vaccine. That's the Johnson and Johnson and Johnson and Noviral vector

223
0:23:14,320 --> 0:23:22,960
vaccine. And the authors evaluated antibody and T cell responses on day 239. That's about eight

224
0:23:22,960 --> 0:23:31,360
months after a single shot vaccine regimen, but also six months after a two shot regimen where they

225
0:23:31,360 --> 0:23:37,760
got one shot and they got another. Basically, what they were telling us is they excluded three

226
0:23:37,760 --> 0:23:42,080
individuals or 10 individuals, 10 individuals, three got excluded. So these are not big numbers

227
0:23:42,080 --> 0:23:47,280
here. One of the individuals had a breakthrough infection, nice spike in their antibodies because

228
0:23:47,280 --> 0:23:52,880
that couple others had a big spike in their antibodies turned out they went and got some mRNA vaccines.

229
0:23:54,000 --> 0:23:59,280
After they excluded those folks, they looked at the remaining and they reported that the spike

230
0:23:59,280 --> 0:24:07,840
specific interfere on gamma CD8 and CD4 T cell response showed durability and stability over

231
0:24:07,840 --> 0:24:14,560
this time period, the same with the antibody levels. There also was an interesting comment.

232
0:24:14,560 --> 0:24:20,000
This is really just a one page or so. There's not as much in here as one would like, but there's

233
0:24:20,000 --> 0:24:27,440
a lot packed in there. It looked like the neutralizing antibody breadth was expanding over time. So

234
0:24:27,440 --> 0:24:31,920
that'll be sort of interesting as we get more data on that. So I think this goes along with

235
0:24:31,920 --> 0:24:37,120
what we've seen. Those germinal centers keep sort of churning along. People have said two to four

236
0:24:37,120 --> 0:24:41,280
weeks after that vaccine is when you're protected. Well, it looks like that protection continues

237
0:24:41,280 --> 0:24:48,720
to evolve over some period of time. Now we also had another paper. This was forwarded to me by

238
0:24:48,720 --> 0:24:56,400
my good friend Dr. Amy Rosenfeld. And the paper was effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines for

239
0:24:56,400 --> 0:25:01,920
preventing COVID-19 hospitalizations in the United States. This was a pre-print. This was a

240
0:25:01,920 --> 0:25:10,160
multi-center case control analysis in the U.S. adults hospitalized March 11 through May 5th, 2021.

241
0:25:10,160 --> 0:25:19,840
And the authors looked at 1,210 participants, median age 58 years. 22.8% were black. 13.8%

242
0:25:19,840 --> 0:25:28,960
were Hispanic. 20.6 had immunosuppression. The SARS alpha variant, the SARS-CoV-2 alpha variant

243
0:25:28,960 --> 0:25:36,880
was the most common variant, 59.7% of the sequenced viruses. They reported overall vaccine effectiveness

244
0:25:36,880 --> 0:25:44,720
for preventing hospitalizations was 86.9. They reported that the vaccine effectiveness in patients

245
0:25:44,720 --> 0:25:52,960
with immunosuppression was approximately 60%. And for patients with active solid organ or

246
0:25:52,960 --> 0:25:58,880
hematological malignancies, so solid organ would be, I will say, like a liver cancer, kidney cancer,

247
0:25:58,880 --> 0:26:06,000
or a hematological malignancy, things like leukemia. The estimated efficacy was still over 50%.

248
0:26:07,680 --> 0:26:11,680
So I do want to sort of point this out. And now we've seen a lot of these serology studies.

249
0:26:13,200 --> 0:26:17,040
For me, this was the really interesting part of the study was looking at individuals with

250
0:26:17,040 --> 0:26:23,520
active cancer, immune suppression. Despite those serology studies, which seem to have said,

251
0:26:23,520 --> 0:26:28,720
oh, these people, they don't show this immunological evidence, tell them that they should get vaccinated

252
0:26:28,720 --> 0:26:35,120
but act like they're not vaccinated. We're not seeing hospitals fill with these immunosuppressed

253
0:26:35,120 --> 0:26:40,560
people. A immunosuppressed person who gets a high antibody level, we don't tell them to rush out to

254
0:26:40,560 --> 0:26:47,760
a big party. But still, that individual who does not show a positive serology test, we're getting

255
0:26:47,760 --> 0:26:53,040
growing experience as well as evidence that those serology antibodies do not correlate with

256
0:26:53,040 --> 0:26:58,480
necessary with immunity. And we are seeing benefit in this population. So all right,

257
0:26:59,200 --> 0:27:03,840
the period of viral replication, the viral symptom phase, right, the time for monitoring

258
0:27:03,840 --> 0:27:10,320
and monoclonals, you know, and as I like to say, where you get tested, as ideally, we get your monoclonals.

259
0:27:11,120 --> 0:27:18,880
We may be moving away from the BAM Linivimab at TESS of a MAB into other cocktails and other

260
0:27:18,880 --> 0:27:25,360
therapies, but we did get a publication in the New England Journal of Medicine, BAM Linivimab,

261
0:27:25,360 --> 0:27:32,640
plus a TESS of a MAB in mild or moderate COVID-19. And this was done back before we were seeing a

262
0:27:32,640 --> 0:27:39,440
lot of the resistant variants. So this was a phase three trial in which ambulatory patients

263
0:27:39,440 --> 0:27:44,560
with mild or moderate COVID-19, who were at high risk for progression to severe disease,

264
0:27:44,560 --> 0:27:51,040
were randomly assigned randomly assigned in a one-to-one ratio to receive a single intravenous

265
0:27:51,040 --> 0:27:58,640
infusion of either this monoclonal antibody combination agent or placebo within three days

266
0:27:58,640 --> 0:28:04,800
after a laboratory diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome. So SARS-CoV-2 infection,

267
0:28:04,800 --> 0:28:12,160
COVID-19. So nice and early, where we want to see it, the high-risk population, the primary outcome

268
0:28:12,160 --> 0:28:18,400
was the overall clinical status of the patients defined as COVID-19-related hospitalization or

269
0:28:18,400 --> 0:28:24,960
death from any cause by day 29. So a total of over 1,000, it was 1,035 patients underwent

270
0:28:24,960 --> 0:28:35,280
randomization and received the infusion or placebo. So by T29, 2.1% of the monoclonal

271
0:28:35,280 --> 0:28:41,520
infuse, the BAM Linivimab, a TESS of a MAB group, had a COVID-19-related hospitalization or death

272
0:28:41,520 --> 0:28:48,880
as compared to 7% in the placebo group. So a relative risk difference, 70%. So about a 30%

273
0:28:48,880 --> 0:28:57,360
risk reduction here, nice p-value, 0.001. No deaths occurred in any of the people that got the

274
0:28:57,360 --> 0:29:03,760
monoclonals. There were 10 deaths in the placebo group. Also a little more data that there was a

275
0:29:03,760 --> 0:29:10,320
greater reduction from baseline in the viral load, people getting monoclonals versus not.

276
0:29:11,600 --> 0:29:17,680
So we are, this is, I think, proof of principle of the monoclonals. We are shifting to the right

277
0:29:17,680 --> 0:29:23,280
monoclonal for the variant that you might have. But I continue to reinforce, this is incredibly

278
0:29:23,280 --> 0:29:30,800
powerful effective therapy. All right. So more negative data on Ivermectin with the publication

279
0:29:30,800 --> 0:29:38,000
of Ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19, a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized

280
0:29:38,000 --> 0:29:43,200
controlled trials. This was published in CID, clinical infectious disease. Now I don't want to

281
0:29:43,200 --> 0:29:48,160
spend too much time in this paper. As the authors point out themselves, based on the review, I'm

282
0:29:48,160 --> 0:29:55,280
going to quote here, the quality of evidence was low or very low for all outcomes. And their

283
0:29:55,280 --> 0:30:01,680
comment was that based upon available evidence, Ivermectin should only be used within clinical

284
0:30:01,680 --> 0:30:06,880
trials. And I have to say, I was a little surprised that this paper was published in CID.

285
0:30:07,600 --> 0:30:12,880
As the evidence they were looking at was really very low for all of the outcomes.

286
0:30:12,880 --> 0:30:17,280
And I think if they had sort of gone in the other direction saying we have really low

287
0:30:17,840 --> 0:30:22,560
poor quality evidence suggesting you should use Ivermectin, I don't think it would have gotten

288
0:30:23,200 --> 0:30:31,200
published. There is a lot of Ivermectin being used out there. What I take away from this is we

289
0:30:31,200 --> 0:30:37,920
really need a proper trial, not lots of anecdotes, not lots of small trials. We don't need sites

290
0:30:37,920 --> 0:30:45,520
with Ivermectin in the URL to go. We also have sort of a word of warning. We have a lot of folks

291
0:30:45,520 --> 0:30:52,240
out there using veterinary Ivermectin products, random doses, random periods of time, no clear

292
0:30:52,240 --> 0:30:59,600
timing relative to infection. This just seems like a terrible idea all around. I do think that

293
0:30:59,600 --> 0:31:06,320
we need really clear guidance on the role of Ivermectin either way. If we have clear,

294
0:31:06,320 --> 0:31:10,720
well-controlled trials that say Ivermectin provides some benefit in some people at some

295
0:31:10,720 --> 0:31:15,280
time, that's great. If it comes out the other way, we need to know that because right now this

296
0:31:15,280 --> 0:31:19,520
is a bit of the Wild West. We have believers, we have non-believers, it's very emotional.

297
0:31:20,880 --> 0:31:28,160
We need to know if this has a role in the disease. And I think this just sort of, if you like Ivermectin,

298
0:31:28,160 --> 0:31:33,760
you're angry about this trial. If you're not excited about Ivermectin, this is the,

299
0:31:33,760 --> 0:31:38,640
you know, I've always said, I don't know if this has, we just don't have the quality data,

300
0:31:38,640 --> 0:31:45,520
we need to guide us in this issue. All right, I'm going to get right here to the tail phase

301
0:31:45,520 --> 0:31:50,880
along COVID. And I want to say the CDC seems to have been really busy the last couple of weeks,

302
0:31:50,880 --> 0:31:55,280
everyone else was celebrating the fourth, the CDC was, you know, mandatory workday.

303
0:31:56,400 --> 0:32:02,800
On July 12th, there was an update on their post-COVID conditions page and under the

304
0:32:02,800 --> 0:32:07,280
prevention section, there were two, what I thought were interesting comments. One,

305
0:32:08,080 --> 0:32:14,080
the best way to prevent post-COVID conditions is by getting vaccinated against COVID-19

306
0:32:14,080 --> 0:32:20,320
as soon as you can. COVID-19 vaccination is recommended for all people, ages 12 and older,

307
0:32:21,200 --> 0:32:29,200
including if you had COVID-19 or a post-COVID condition. Now vaccination is not 100%. We certainly

308
0:32:29,200 --> 0:32:33,840
have seen individuals with breakthrough infections that go on to get long COVID,

309
0:32:33,840 --> 0:32:38,400
but that is a relatively small number compared to unvaccinated individuals.

310
0:32:39,200 --> 0:32:44,240
Next number two, although I thought this was interesting, although media articles have reported

311
0:32:44,240 --> 0:32:50,240
that some people with post-COVID conditions say their symptoms improved after being vaccinated,

312
0:32:50,240 --> 0:32:54,720
studies are needed to determine the effects of vaccination on post-COVID conditions.

313
0:32:54,720 --> 0:33:01,120
Then, under what CDC is doing, they state rapid and multi-year studies are underway to further

314
0:33:01,120 --> 0:33:07,120
investigate post-COVID conditions. These studies will help us better understand post-COVID conditions

315
0:33:07,120 --> 0:33:13,920
and how to treat patients with these longer-term effects. Now I think this should be reassuring

316
0:33:13,920 --> 0:33:19,040
to the millions, and it is millions at this point here in the US alone, suffering with post-COVID

317
0:33:19,040 --> 0:33:27,280
conditions. There was a BBC that I listened to earlier today, really talking about how the UK

318
0:33:27,280 --> 0:33:32,480
has recognized the post-COVID conditions. The US has recognized the post-COVID conditions,

319
0:33:32,480 --> 0:33:38,480
but the world is still dismissing this. And just think of all the COVID cases throughout the world

320
0:33:38,480 --> 0:33:41,840
and all the individuals that are going to suffer as a consequence of that.

321
0:33:42,960 --> 0:33:47,920
So there's really a commitment here in the United States, I have to say, there's funding,

322
0:33:47,920 --> 0:33:52,640
there's an organized effort, there are hard-working, brilliant, committed people working on this issue,

323
0:33:53,280 --> 0:33:58,880
and I am hoping that this science gets accomplished, and we can really help these individuals.

324
0:33:58,880 --> 0:34:03,760
So before we go to the emails, I want to remind everyone, we're getting near the end of July,

325
0:34:03,760 --> 0:34:08,480
we're almost at the end of our foundation international medical relief for children fundraiser.

326
0:34:09,360 --> 0:34:13,600
And along those same lines, this is critical. This is an organization that works throughout

327
0:34:13,600 --> 0:34:18,640
the world, working in those areas that are still being ravaged by the pandemic. The numbers are

328
0:34:18,640 --> 0:34:24,000
going up throughout the world. They are not going down. People are getting sick, people are ending

329
0:34:24,000 --> 0:34:28,800
up in the hospital, people are dying, people are recovering, but then continuing to have long

330
0:34:28,800 --> 0:34:34,960
COVID symptoms. So this is not over. Help us and help FIMRIC, go to parasiteswithoutborders.com,

332
0:34:37,520 --> 0:34:44,480
Time for some email questions for Daniel. If you'd like to send one in, the address is

333
0:34:44,480 --> 0:34:51,200
Daniel at microb.tv. Now, I had one here queued up from D who wants to know what's going on with

334
0:34:51,200 --> 0:34:59,040
Ivermectin. She has friends who are trying to get it online, prescription and so forth, but I

335
0:34:59,040 --> 0:35:05,520
think you answered it pretty much, Daniel. So I will publish the letter in the letters part,

336
0:35:05,520 --> 0:35:11,520
but I think we don't need to address it. So D, I'm sure you got an answer from Daniel just now.

337
0:35:11,520 --> 0:35:18,560
So George writes, my four-year-old son had a surgically repaired VSD and ASD at six months old. His

338
0:35:18,560 --> 0:35:23,520
annual checkups have shown normal heart function since then. As you know, he's ineligible for a

339
0:35:23,520 --> 0:35:27,920
vaccine yet, but as we get closer to an approval for his age group, I wanted to ask whether the

340
0:35:27,920 --> 0:35:34,080
recent myocarditis risk would give you pause if he were eligible today. It's frequently mentioned

341
0:35:34,080 --> 0:35:41,200
that those who show symptoms of myocarditis or pericarditis post-vaccine respond well to treatment,

342
0:35:41,200 --> 0:35:45,200
but it seems to go on set of what that treatment entails and how that applies to those who have

343
0:35:45,200 --> 0:35:50,560
had congenital heart defects. As you know, they have a lifelong higher risk of endocarditis.

344
0:35:50,560 --> 0:35:55,680
I'm leaning towards vaccination, but wanted to understand the risks better, especially at this age group.

345
0:35:55,680 --> 0:36:01,040
And so this is great. And I want to say, I think it's great that you're asking questions.

346
0:36:01,040 --> 0:36:06,000
There's no problem asking questions about vaccinations. There's no problem wanting to be

347
0:36:06,000 --> 0:36:11,440
informed when you make this decision. We've moved past sort of the cattle approach of hurting

348
0:36:11,440 --> 0:36:16,880
people through these giant centers. And particularly now, as we're looking at younger individuals,

349
0:36:16,880 --> 0:36:23,360
there's a different metric. You look at an 80-year-old getting COVID versus vaccination.

350
0:36:23,360 --> 0:36:27,680
There's no, there's really nothing. It's very obvious that vaccination is there.

351
0:36:27,680 --> 0:36:33,120
But let's look at this case. So what we're looking at this point, unfortunately, is COVID is here

352
0:36:33,120 --> 0:36:40,560
to stay. So your calculation is the risk of vaccination versus the risk of COVID. So focusing

353
0:36:40,560 --> 0:36:46,240
just on the cardiac issues. I think I mentioned this last time, a friend of mine, Michael Amala,

354
0:36:46,240 --> 0:36:53,120
Dr. Michael Amala, actually as a cardiologist, went through kind of the risks of heart issues

355
0:36:53,120 --> 0:36:59,840
with COVID. And it's probably a couple percent is the low bar. Probably at least 2 percent of

356
0:36:59,840 --> 0:37:06,640
people that could COVID will have some evidence of heart issues. Some of that heart issues will

357
0:37:06,640 --> 0:37:11,920
continue farther along. If you do more sensitive testing, it might be as high as 50 percent.

358
0:37:12,560 --> 0:37:17,600
COVID triggers inflammation that affects the heart in a large number of individuals.

359
0:37:17,600 --> 0:37:24,080
So I see someone like your child that you're describing. And I say, boy, this is not a person

360
0:37:24,080 --> 0:37:31,280
that you want at risk for COVID. The vaccine is not zero in terms of risk, but the risk there

361
0:37:31,920 --> 0:37:36,080
is much lower with vaccination than it would be with having COVID. So that's the way I would

362
0:37:36,080 --> 0:37:42,800
weigh that decision. Protect your child so that they don't get COVID. Take that tiny risk when

363
0:37:42,800 --> 0:37:47,280
you know potentially it's going to happen with the vaccination. What is that treatment? It's

364
0:37:47,280 --> 0:37:53,200
ibuprofen. It's a leave. It's about 48 hours of taking it easy, and then the child is better.

365
0:37:53,920 --> 0:37:58,480
Quite a bit different than so many of the children that we've seen with long-term effects after COVID.

366
0:38:00,160 --> 0:38:04,960
James writes, dear Dr. Griffin, I'm so grateful for your podcast to the point the 20-something

367
0:38:04,960 --> 0:38:10,720
year-old son of one of my co-workers tested positive today for COVID-19. He reported symptoms

368
0:38:10,720 --> 0:38:16,800
yesterday. Should he be given monoclonal therapy or is such therapy reserved for higher risk patients?

369
0:38:18,240 --> 0:38:24,160
Yeah, this is almost the exact question I was just answering earlier today. It's a

370
0:38:24,160 --> 0:38:29,760
colleague of mine, had a family member who ended up, and actually, in that case, it was a second

371
0:38:29,760 --> 0:38:37,040
infection, which just troubles me. With these individuals who are 20 years old, they're considered

372
0:38:37,040 --> 0:38:42,320
at low risk. Even though the monoclonal antibodies are considered at very low risk safe therapy,

373
0:38:42,320 --> 0:38:49,040
we still have a limit to the EUA. These are sitting on shelves, but you have to go through and say,

374
0:38:49,040 --> 0:38:54,560
is this an individual who maybe their BMI is above 25? Actually, and you can Google, I'm going to

375
0:38:54,560 --> 0:39:02,400
say Google or Search, Internet Search, the Regeneron monoclonal fact sheet, and there's a list.

376
0:39:02,400 --> 0:39:08,320
But if there's diabetes, if there's any of these things, reach out to a clinician, have them help

377
0:39:08,320 --> 0:39:14,560
you work through this. If you've got a 20-year-old with a BMI of 26, they would qualify and be

378
0:39:14,560 --> 0:39:19,360
eligible for monoclonals, and it would make sense. So there's combination here of a risk-benefit

379
0:39:19,360 --> 0:39:25,360
ratio, but there's also a limited access, because this is still EUA products. These don't have quite

380
0:39:25,360 --> 0:39:28,400
the experience where we would start extending that off-label.

381
0:39:28,400 --> 0:39:35,600
And Martin from the UK writes, I'm seeking facts or merely off-the-record opinion as to whether

382
0:39:35,600 --> 0:39:42,880
Pfizer or other vaccinated asthma patients with occasional recourse to prednisolone run the risk

383
0:39:42,880 --> 0:39:48,160
of negating the benefits of vaccine effectiveness, or of significantly reducing immunity by

384
0:39:48,160 --> 0:39:55,040
medicating with low dose prednisolone, say, daily five to 10 eggs for a week or two. I'm assuming

385
0:39:55,040 --> 0:40:00,960
more typical rescue dosage of prednisolone. 40-migs daily would certainly best be avoided,

386
0:40:00,960 --> 0:40:05,760
unless the degree of exacerbation presented its own major health risk. Are you aware of any

387
0:40:05,760 --> 0:40:10,560
research on this topic? Could you venture a generalized opinion? What are the respiratory

388
0:40:10,560 --> 0:40:16,000
team in your hospital advising such asthma patients to do about oral steroid use during COVID?

389
0:40:16,000 --> 0:40:21,920
Also, is there a similar vaccine-negating or immunity-lowering risk for inhaler usage,

390
0:40:21,920 --> 0:40:26,080
where maximum licensed daily-inhaled steroids have been prescribed?

391
0:40:27,200 --> 0:40:33,200
Okay, so these are great, this great line of questioning. So we do have some data, at least on

392
0:40:33,200 --> 0:40:38,480
the serologies, right, that if someone gets vaccinated, and this makes sense immunologically,

393
0:40:38,480 --> 0:40:43,200
we would expect there to be a less robust antibody response. I don't think the steroids are going

394
0:40:43,200 --> 0:40:47,680
to have as much of an impact on your T-cell response, but we are in general recommending

395
0:40:47,680 --> 0:40:53,440
if you can stay off of immunosuppressants for a couple weeks before that vaccination.

396
0:40:54,480 --> 0:40:58,640
Hopefully stay off till you finish the cycle, so try to reduce that if possible.

397
0:40:58,640 --> 0:41:04,240
Inhaled are definitely going to have a lower systemic level than taken orally,

398
0:41:04,240 --> 0:41:09,760
so we would think of that as preferable. We do think these individuals are getting protection

399
0:41:09,760 --> 0:41:14,080
from the vaccines, but what we're trying to do is limit the drug and other effects on the immune

400
0:41:14,080 --> 0:41:21,360
response. That's COVID-19 clinical update number 71 with Dr. Daniel Griffin. Thank you, Daniel.

401
0:41:21,360 --> 0:41:51,200
Oh, thank you, Vincent. Thank you, everybody, and be safe.
