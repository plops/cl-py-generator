This week in virology, the podcast about viruses, the kind that make you sick.

2
0:00:10,320 --> 0:00:22,000
From MicroTV, this is Twiv, this week in virology episode 744 recorded on April 15th, 2021.

3
0:00:22,000 --> 0:00:27,040
I'm Vincent Rackeniello, and you're listening to the podcast All About Viruses.

4
0:00:27,040 --> 0:00:31,360
Joining me today from New York, Daniel Griffin.

5
0:00:31,360 --> 0:00:32,960
Hello, everyone.

6
0:00:33,840 --> 0:00:36,960
This is clinical update number 58.

7
0:00:37,760 --> 0:00:39,920
Things gotten better since last week, Daniel.

8
0:00:41,360 --> 0:00:46,960
I'm not going to say that they have, and I will start off with the quotation that is in line with

9
0:00:46,960 --> 0:00:53,920
that. When things are going well, something will go wrong. When things just can't get any worse,

10
0:00:53,920 --> 0:00:59,440
they will. Anytime things appear to be going better, you have overlooked something.

11
0:01:00,880 --> 0:01:04,720
And that is the immortal words of Richard Feynman.

12
0:01:04,720 --> 0:01:07,040
Excellent. That's perfect for this week, isn't it?

13
0:01:08,400 --> 0:01:15,440
Yes. Actually, I don't know if people have a chance to read, but he's written a few books.

14
0:01:15,440 --> 0:01:19,120
One of them surely you must be joking is one of my favorites.

15
0:01:19,120 --> 0:01:23,840
But, yes, this has been a very tough week.

16
0:01:25,120 --> 0:01:30,960
Never miss an opportunity to vaccinate, never miss an opportunity to test, never waste a vaccine

17
0:01:30,960 --> 0:01:37,040
dose. Let me start off with my update. We've got a lot of stuff that happened this last week,

18
0:01:37,040 --> 0:01:41,920
so we have a lot to cover. But this week there was some attention given to

19
0:01:41,920 --> 0:01:47,760
lost on the front line, which has been a 12-month investigation by the Guardian,

20
0:01:47,760 --> 0:01:52,400
Cage, and to track healthcare worker deaths during the pandemic.

21
0:01:53,200 --> 0:02:00,560
And I found that reading the article, this was titled, 12 months of trauma, more than 3,600

22
0:02:00,560 --> 0:02:07,120
US health workers died in COVID's first year. It was a very emotional experience for me to read

23
0:02:07,120 --> 0:02:12,800
this through. I focus on the science, what we can learn from this experience, what we have

24
0:02:12,800 --> 0:02:17,520
learned about how to treat this horrible disease. But all the work we still need to

25
0:02:17,520 --> 0:02:23,680
do, and I think to take stock of what we've really been through is upsetting.

26
0:02:24,640 --> 0:02:29,360
As I ever count, thousands of health care workers that have died over the last year,

27
0:02:31,200 --> 0:02:36,080
many of these are my colleagues, many of these individuals I've known,

28
0:02:36,080 --> 0:02:41,280
trained with. There were some key findings that were here in this publication,

29
0:02:41,280 --> 0:02:48,720
and just a few of them. One, more than half of those who died were younger than 60.

30
0:02:49,680 --> 0:02:56,160
And I think that is something. The general population, the median age of people who died

31
0:02:56,160 --> 0:03:03,280
from COVID is in the 70s. But in the healthcare worker population, it was younger. The other

32
0:03:03,280 --> 0:03:10,720
nurses and support staff died in far higher numbers than physicians. So there's an equity

33
0:03:10,720 --> 0:03:18,000
issue here, where the physicians were either better able to or better helped to keep themselves

34
0:03:18,000 --> 0:03:22,000
safe. As I think a lot of people know, if they've ever been in the hospital,

35
0:03:22,000 --> 0:03:27,040
ever interacted with healthcare, it's the nurses, it's the assistants, it's the age

36
0:03:27,600 --> 0:03:34,800
who are really in their hands on. And one or the other, twice as many workers,

37
0:03:34,800 --> 0:03:41,280
healthcare workers died in nursing homes as in the hospitals. And this is something

38
0:03:41,280 --> 0:03:46,720
particularly sort of sensitive issue for me, because of all the controversies about the nursing

39
0:03:46,720 --> 0:03:51,360
homes and the fact that a lot of those workers were, I have to say, blamed, you know, say,

40
0:03:51,360 --> 0:03:55,520
oh, those hardworking healthcare workers brought it into the nursing homes. It's really tragic

41
0:03:55,520 --> 0:04:00,000
just how many of my colleagues have died through the last year. The last week, I was

42
0:04:00,000 --> 0:04:04,960
talking with one of my partners and Nuja Lee, who is now the associate chief of the Division

43
0:04:04,960 --> 0:04:10,320
of Infectious Disease for Pro Health New York. Just about how fondly I remember all the support

44
0:04:10,320 --> 0:04:14,640
and recognition we received from our communities during these difficult times, you know, the free

45
0:04:14,640 --> 0:04:20,640
food, the evening vigils, the placards, some of those are still up. Just let everyone know,

46
0:04:20,640 --> 0:04:26,960
this has really meant a tremendous amount. Things continue to be tough, but I have to say all the

47
0:04:26,960 --> 0:04:33,600
support has really meant something. So thank you. In addition to all my colleagues that died

48
0:04:33,600 --> 0:04:39,440
directly from COVID, I suspect many of our listeners are aware of how many. Well, more than one of

49
0:04:39,440 --> 0:04:45,280
my colleagues, you know, you may even know sort of in local community circles here, just found this

50
0:04:45,280 --> 0:04:48,880
whole tragedy be too much and actually took their own lives during these dark times. So,

51
0:04:50,000 --> 0:04:55,120
you know, this continues to be a difficult time. We are on a plateau with far too many people

52
0:04:55,120 --> 0:05:00,480
getting infected far too many people dying here in the US were on a plateau. But when we look

53
0:05:00,480 --> 0:05:05,280
beyond our borders and we don't have to look very far, we can see those numbers. We're now seeing

54
0:05:05,280 --> 0:05:12,240
counted over 5 million new cases a week. And the death toll just keeps climbing. So we are,

55
0:05:12,240 --> 0:05:20,320
we are nowhere near mission accomplished here. All right. On that happy note, children and COVID

56
0:05:20,320 --> 0:05:25,600
and masks, I'm going to throw in here. So perhaps I'll be remembered for a few things.

57
0:05:26,560 --> 0:05:33,040
You know, after this settles down, you know, one of them trying to point out early on the tragedy

58
0:05:33,040 --> 0:05:39,920
of long COVID and not to dismiss these individuals that this was real. But I think the other is for

59
0:05:39,920 --> 0:05:46,640
repeatedly my attempts to point out that children, I believe are at lower risk, but they're not at

60
0:05:46,640 --> 0:05:52,720
no risk. So there was a research letter that was published in JAMA characteristics and disease

61
0:05:52,720 --> 0:06:00,000
severity of US children and adolescents diagnosed with COVID-19. Now, the authors here were affiliated

62
0:06:00,000 --> 0:06:08,480
with the COVID-19 response team at the CDC, the Epidemic Intelligence Service Center for Surveillance,

63
0:06:08,480 --> 0:06:16,080
Epidemiology and Laboratory Sciences, also at the CDC, and the Commissioned Core US Public Health

64
0:06:16,080 --> 0:06:24,240
Service in Rockland, Maryland. And a couple of things that this article pointed out. One was that

65
0:06:24,880 --> 0:06:32,800
more than 2 million pediatric COVID-19 cases were reported in the United States, you know, in 2020.

66
0:06:33,840 --> 0:06:39,120
And they say, although approximately half of pediatric patients with COVID-19 experience mild

67
0:06:39,120 --> 0:06:44,720
disease, some children require admission to intensive care units or require the use of invasive

68
0:06:44,720 --> 0:06:51,360
mechanical ventilation. And what they did here is they conducted a cohort study to try to estimate

69
0:06:51,920 --> 0:06:58,800
just an association between demographic clinical characteristics and severe COVID-19 among hospitalized

70
0:06:58,800 --> 0:07:03,680
pediatric patients. So we just go through a little bit of what they present to us, but then I'm going

71
0:07:03,680 --> 0:07:12,720
to give the caveats as well. So they they evaluated a cohort of 20,714 pediatric patients with COVID-19

72
0:07:12,720 --> 0:07:21,200
pretty evenly split, about 52.9% were girls. The other half males, right? So we have sort of a split

73
0:07:21,200 --> 0:07:29,520
here. They reported that of these individuals, 11.7% were hospitalized, and of those hospitalized,

74
0:07:29,520 --> 0:07:38,320
about a third had severe COVID with management in the ICU. So a lot of caveats here. I think that we

75
0:07:38,320 --> 0:07:44,000
can say a couple things from the study one, and this seems consistent with the experience shared

76
0:07:44,000 --> 0:07:49,920
among my pediatric colleagues, is that if a person under the age of 18 ends up in the hospital,

77
0:07:50,560 --> 0:07:56,400
as we saw this cohort, a quarter to a third of them will be taken care of in the ICU.

78
0:07:57,120 --> 0:08:03,120
One of the things the authors even said is it isn't even necessarily the same level of severity

79
0:08:03,120 --> 0:08:08,880
we might see an adult that prompts that, but we sort of have a heightened level of concern for our

80
0:08:09,520 --> 0:08:16,720
younger individuals. One of the things that is tough, I don't think we really have a good sense,

81
0:08:16,720 --> 0:08:22,880
and I've touched this before, about how many kids with COVID actually go undiagnosed.

82
0:08:23,680 --> 0:08:28,400
You know, we never find all the asymptomatic kids, and we certainly never find the untested

83
0:08:28,400 --> 0:08:34,720
symptomatic kids. So I don't think we have a true denominator here. So the one thing I'm going to

84
0:08:34,720 --> 0:08:41,840
say, and I like to be honest on this, when I see 11.7% of kids that get COVID end up in the hospital,

85
0:08:41,840 --> 0:08:48,160
I don't think that really is consistent with our experience. I think 11.7% of this cohort

86
0:08:48,160 --> 0:08:53,600
ended up in the hospital, that is true. But I'm not sure this is representative of the entire

87
0:08:53,600 --> 0:09:00,320
pediatric cohort. I think if that was actually happening, our pediatric hospitals would not be

88
0:09:00,320 --> 0:09:06,320
as quiet as they were during the pandemic to date. That may be different in different countries.

89
0:09:06,320 --> 0:09:10,240
Some positive news on the vaccine front. Don't worry, I'll get to the negative.

90
0:09:11,200 --> 0:09:16,800
Pfizer, BioNTech, did announce that they are requesting expansion of their E-way to include

91
0:09:16,800 --> 0:09:23,760
individuals age 12, 13, 14, and 15. And I discussed a week ago when we recorded the last

92
0:09:23,760 --> 0:09:28,320
wave that this was sort of impending. And once that was announced, the clock would start with a

93
0:09:28,320 --> 0:09:35,520
minimum of 15 days from the announcement. So we're moving into that. So we're hoping that in

94
0:09:35,520 --> 0:09:44,320
May, we're going to see Pfizer expanded down to age 12. Also, still in the children in COVID,

95
0:09:44,320 --> 0:09:51,040
I've been getting a lot of communications about this. I think many people are comfortable with the

96
0:09:51,040 --> 0:09:56,800
idea that schools can be safely open. But I'm getting a lot of questions about something I brought

97
0:09:56,800 --> 0:10:04,160
up on the last 12. And this is this seeming disconnect between it's safe for the kids to sit

98
0:10:04,160 --> 0:10:12,560
three feet apart with masks on. And at the same point, the CDC considering being within less than

99
0:10:12,560 --> 0:10:20,320
six feet, so at three feet, regardless of masks being an exposure. So where are we with? What are

100
0:10:20,320 --> 0:10:28,080
the updated as of March 21st, 2021 CDC public health guidance for community related exposure

101
0:10:28,080 --> 0:10:36,000
definitions and guidance? So as per the CDC, individuals who have had close contact within six feet

102
0:10:36,000 --> 0:10:41,600
for a total of 15 minutes or more exposed to, and I'm going to pause there for a second, right? So the

103
0:10:41,600 --> 0:10:48,880
CDC is still using that 15 minutes. I know a lot of times you see the 10 minutes thrown out there,

104
0:10:48,880 --> 0:10:55,200
but sort of scouring through the CDC website 15 minutes seems to be what the CDC is still

105
0:10:55,200 --> 0:11:04,000
still putting out there exposed to to whom to a person with COVID-19 who either has symptoms

106
0:11:04,000 --> 0:11:10,880
or in the period two days before symptom onset until they meet the criteria for discontinuing

107
0:11:11,440 --> 0:11:17,600
isolation, right? So that is either 10 days or there's the test out ending isolation option.

108
0:11:18,560 --> 0:11:25,280
Or the other is a person who has tested positive for COVID-19, but it has not had any symptoms. So

109
0:11:25,280 --> 0:11:29,520
again, you can do the same thing. You're going to use that as your start date and the exposure is

110
0:11:29,520 --> 0:11:35,360
anytime two days prior to that positive test or until they meet the criteria for ending the

111
0:11:35,360 --> 0:11:41,120
isolation. So the two issues here, the first one I pointed out, 10 minutes versus 15 minutes,

112
0:11:41,120 --> 0:11:47,840
the CDC is still using the 15 minutes. But then there was a note, there's a note sort of right

113
0:11:47,840 --> 0:11:55,520
below this, and it says note this exposure, this is irrespective of whether the person with COVID-19

114
0:11:55,520 --> 0:12:02,400
or the contact was wearing a mask or whether the contact was wearing respiratory, personal,

115
0:12:02,400 --> 0:12:09,600
protective equipment, PPA. So wait, do masks work? We were just told, right, that three feet of

116
0:12:09,600 --> 0:12:16,240
distance with everyone wearing masks in schools is minimal risk. So here comes down to the issue

117
0:12:16,240 --> 0:12:24,560
is should the CDC update guidance for what is considered a school exposure and what ends up

118
0:12:24,560 --> 0:12:28,480
triggering quarantine? I will stay one of the schools in our area, not right here in Port

119
0:12:28,480 --> 0:12:34,880
Washington, one of our local schools has been in contact with the local community of health,

120
0:12:34,880 --> 0:12:39,520
local department of health, and they've actually sort of updated their local guidance and said,

121
0:12:39,520 --> 0:12:43,760
no, if we're going to allow these schools to open under these circumstances, if everyone's wearing

122
0:12:43,760 --> 0:12:49,840
masks, three feet apart with enforced mask wearing, if that's really being held to, we're not considered

123
0:12:49,840 --> 0:12:56,640
that, can you consider that a trigger for quarantine? So I think this is an important issue.

124
0:12:57,920 --> 0:13:04,800
If being three feet apart, less than six feet wearing mask indoors at a school should count

125
0:13:04,800 --> 0:13:10,080
as an exposure, this is actually an interesting issue because for health care workers, we actually

126
0:13:10,080 --> 0:13:16,160
have slightly different rules, right? For health care workers, there's the idea that we know how

127
0:13:16,160 --> 0:13:23,120
to properly wear masks, and there is some concern that at least per the CDC up till now,

128
0:13:24,000 --> 0:13:31,440
that people don't really either know how to wear masks properly, or the masks that they are wearing

129
0:13:31,440 --> 0:13:36,720
are not proper masks. So I understand the concern, right? The people don't wear their masks properly,

130
0:13:36,720 --> 0:13:43,280
the masks are a different quality, but I do want to point out, Dr. Fauci, we all see him on TV,

131
0:13:43,280 --> 0:13:49,440
we see our president, they're not wearing medical masks, they're wearing cloth masks. So I think

132
0:13:49,440 --> 0:13:56,160
it's critical for messaging that we get on the same page with regard to our masks effective or not,

133
0:13:56,880 --> 0:14:03,280
but maybe we haven't been doing enough education about how to wear those masks properly. So I'm

134
0:14:03,280 --> 0:14:08,480
actually going to take a moment here, this will be my public service announcement on how do you wear

135
0:14:08,480 --> 0:14:15,600
your mask properly? And I'm basically going to be sharing helpful CDC advice on how to improve

136
0:14:15,600 --> 0:14:21,200
how your mask protects you and others. So I'm going to hit eight points here. So one,

137
0:14:21,200 --> 0:14:27,920
make sure your mask fits snugly across your face. You should be breathing through your mask and not

138
0:14:27,920 --> 0:14:34,320
around it, and please cover your nose. In my mind, if your nose is sticking out, you are not actually

139
0:14:34,320 --> 0:14:40,000
wearing a mask. And I have a couple, you know, for those people watching, I have a couple masks

140
0:14:40,000 --> 0:14:43,680
here to demonstrate. So I'm going to demonstrate that now. If you're listening, I'll describe it

141
0:14:43,680 --> 0:14:47,600
for you. I'm going to put a mask on that will fit snugly against my face.

142
0:14:51,760 --> 0:14:56,880
And I think people who are watching can see this is actually, I want to thank one of our listeners

143
0:14:56,880 --> 0:15:02,720
who I believe this is handmade in Thailand. It's not important that your mask is completely symmetrical,

144
0:15:02,720 --> 0:15:08,320
right? It's just important, right? I always get in trouble with that, trying to get my mask

145
0:15:08,320 --> 0:15:15,200
symmetrical. But it has to fit. You want to use a nose piece if you can. So that's number number

146
0:15:15,200 --> 0:15:20,720
three. So choose a mask with layers. I'm going to take this off now. You don't want to have just

147
0:15:20,720 --> 0:15:26,320
one thin piece of fabric. You want to have layers. Also, some of these will actually have the ability

148
0:15:26,320 --> 0:15:32,880
to put a filter in there. Three, choose a mask with a nose wire to improve the fit and bend that

149
0:15:32,880 --> 0:15:39,520
wire over your nose to fit close to your face. Four, check your mask to make sure you feel warm

150
0:15:39,520 --> 0:15:45,840
air coming through the mask, not out the sides, the top or the bottom. Five, if you have facial

151
0:15:45,840 --> 0:15:51,200
hair, we're not sure how effective masks are. So trim that beard if you can. Consider double

152
0:15:51,200 --> 0:15:58,720
masking. Consider shaving. Six, do not pull your mask down or out of the way to speak. And I want

153
0:15:58,720 --> 0:16:04,080
to use this as an example. Again, you'll see, I saw this and I see this all the time. People put

154
0:16:04,080 --> 0:16:10,560
their mask on and then they want to speak. So they either pull it away from their mouth or they pull

155
0:16:10,560 --> 0:16:17,120
it down to speak. I think while we may have witnessed one of our elected officials, he needed to cough

156
0:16:17,120 --> 0:16:23,680
or sneeze. He pulled off his mask, coughed into his hands, sneezed into his hands. I'm not sure

157
0:16:23,680 --> 0:16:29,200
where he wiped them. But you do not take the mask off to cough or sneeze or talk. You want to have

158
0:16:29,200 --> 0:16:35,120
it on specifically at those times. Also, don't take it off to yell at the athletes. That's another

159
0:16:35,120 --> 0:16:40,480
one I see. Also, teachers, you did not take it off to have your students better understand what

160
0:16:40,480 --> 0:16:45,600
you have to tell them. Seven, do not wear masks with one way valves. They only protect you and

161
0:16:45,600 --> 0:16:51,920
not others. You are sending a very negative message. Eight, do wash your hands immediately

162
0:16:51,920 --> 0:16:57,200
after removing a mask. Remember, this is supposed to protect you. So if it's actually protected you,

163
0:16:57,200 --> 0:17:02,960
it is now potentially dirty. So take it off by the loops and then try to avoid contaminating

164
0:17:02,960 --> 0:17:09,840
your hands. We also have some do knots from the CDC. Do not wear two disposable masks at the same

165
0:17:09,840 --> 0:17:16,080
time. So if you're wearing those, those below mask, which are that charged fiber, these have been

166
0:17:16,080 --> 0:17:22,640
studied one mask at a time not two. And this also applies to the issue of K and 95 or N 95s.

167
0:17:23,280 --> 0:17:27,920
We are currently recommending not to cover those with a surgical mask. I have to say for my medical

168
0:17:27,920 --> 0:17:33,520
colleagues, we got quite used to the fact that we were using surgical masks to protect and preserve

169
0:17:33,520 --> 0:17:40,960
our N 95. So I know some of my colleagues still feel a little bit odd about that. So all right,

170
0:17:40,960 --> 0:17:48,560
the pre exposure period. On April 13, we saw the article, physical inactivity is associated with

171
0:17:48,560 --> 0:17:56,080
a higher risk for severe COVID-19 outcomes, a study in 48,440 adult patients. And this was

172
0:17:56,080 --> 0:18:04,880
published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine. This might be a surprise that exercising might

173
0:18:04,880 --> 0:18:11,520
have some health benefits. But I'm going to go out on a limb here. And what did these individuals

174
0:18:11,520 --> 0:18:19,200
find? They found for those individuals who were consistently inactive, that they had a greater

175
0:18:19,200 --> 0:18:24,640
risk of hospitalization. So these are individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 who were consistently

176
0:18:24,640 --> 0:18:34,000
inactive. Their odds ratio of hospitalization was 2.26. Their admission to the ICU was 1.73

177
0:18:34,000 --> 0:18:39,840
increased odds ratio. And their chance of death was 2.49. So almost twice as likely to die,

178
0:18:41,120 --> 0:18:46,960
if they were diagnosed with COVID-19 ended up in the hospital. So basically, people who are

179
0:18:46,960 --> 0:18:54,000
consistently inactive have a higher risk, at least per this study. So out on a limb, perhaps people

180
0:18:54,000 --> 0:19:00,000
should exercise one more reason. Now we need a randomized control trial where half the people

181
0:19:00,000 --> 0:19:06,880
exercise and the other half serves as the control to really determining if exercise is a good thing.

182
0:19:06,880 --> 0:19:10,960
But I'm a little worried if we do this as a blind study, are people going to end up hurting

183
0:19:10,960 --> 0:19:15,520
themselves? So somehow we have to have people exercising, not exercising, not aware of which

184
0:19:15,520 --> 0:19:22,160
group they're in, and not wearing blindfolds. Testing. I think we're seeing an interesting

185
0:19:22,160 --> 0:19:27,920
pattern here in our primary care and urgent cares where people are post vaccination. And they have

186
0:19:27,920 --> 0:19:34,400
what seems like mild symptoms after a good COVID exposure, but yet there are antigen test

187
0:19:34,400 --> 0:19:40,640
negative. So we may be seeing some of that sort of, you know, effective the vaccine

188
0:19:40,640 --> 0:19:46,880
sort of below the radar of even getting positive testing. So when we have more information, I'll

189
0:19:46,880 --> 0:19:50,560
make sure I share that. Active vaccination. Everyone's probably waiting for this.

190
0:19:50,560 --> 0:19:56,880
I expect all our listeners are familiar with the J&J vaccine pause here in the US. And let me

191
0:19:56,880 --> 0:20:02,400
just give everyone an update. I had the opportunity to be on the call today, where we got to run down

192
0:20:02,400 --> 0:20:08,960
on what we know to date. So this is, this is, you know, hot off the press. So there were six

193
0:20:08,960 --> 0:20:15,680
reports to the vaccine adverse event reporting system between March 19th and April 12th of women

194
0:20:15,680 --> 0:20:22,800
between the ages of 18 and 48, having a rare clotting complication. So these individuals had

195
0:20:22,800 --> 0:20:30,000
cavernous sinus thrombosis. This is a clotting of the vein complex inside your brain sort of,

196
0:20:30,000 --> 0:20:34,640
you know, think about a few inches behind your eyeballs there. And they had platelet counts

197
0:20:34,640 --> 0:20:43,040
less than 150,000 per millimeter acute. I do want to point out by comparison, we have seen

198
0:20:43,040 --> 0:20:52,320
zero reports of this cavernous sinus thrombosis with rhombocytopenia in the 182 million doses

199
0:20:52,320 --> 0:20:58,160
of mRNA vaccines given in the United States. So I know there's a little bit of, oh, this is just

200
0:20:58,160 --> 0:21:03,760
something. But no, this looks like it is not a problem with the mRNA vaccine. So I want to make

201
0:21:03,760 --> 0:21:10,720
that really clear on set. For these individuals, it was six to 13 days after vaccination. So this

202
0:21:10,720 --> 0:21:16,240
sort of follows the timing. That's when we start to see the IgG or the immunoglobulin start to come

203
0:21:16,240 --> 0:21:24,320
up, not necessarily just IgG. They were all Caucasian females, three out of the sixth were

204
0:21:24,320 --> 0:21:29,040
three out of the six were obese. So half were obese, half were not. There were no known

205
0:21:29,040 --> 0:21:35,680
coagulation disorders in this group of six women. Initially, headache was reported in five of the

206
0:21:35,680 --> 0:21:42,080
six. The last person did not have a headache initially, but a headache soon developed. Their

207
0:21:42,080 --> 0:21:51,200
initial presentation was backpaid. Now, half of the patients had clotting in other areas. So

208
0:21:51,200 --> 0:21:57,760
lower extremities, the portal vein, pulmonary artery. And they were able to, and this is going

209
0:21:57,760 --> 0:22:02,960
to be relevant as we go forward, they're able to test for something in anybody against platelet

210
0:22:02,960 --> 0:22:10,240
factor four. And of the five that they were able to test, all of these antibody tests were positive.

211
0:22:10,800 --> 0:22:16,240
One individual died. Two of them recovered and were discharged from the hospital. At the time of

212
0:22:16,240 --> 0:22:22,160
the report that I got today, half of them were still in the hospital. A couple of conclusions,

213
0:22:22,800 --> 0:22:30,400
the rate of this CVST does appear to be higher than would be expected for this observation period,

214
0:22:30,400 --> 0:22:36,880
and in this particular demographic. I will also point out that in the phase three trial,

215
0:22:36,880 --> 0:22:47,600
there was a 25 year old man who also developed CVST. And he also had positive anti-PF 480 bodies.

216
0:22:48,560 --> 0:22:54,240
We still have a significant number of individuals that were just recently vaccinated. And so they

217
0:22:54,240 --> 0:23:01,920
haven't passed through this, say, six to 13 days after vaccination. So we won't reach that until

218
0:23:01,920 --> 0:23:10,480
April 25th. And at that point, we'll have a true number on what is the number of these

219
0:23:10,480 --> 0:23:14,960
events that are happening after vaccination. There's a lot of speculation. I think there's

220
0:23:14,960 --> 0:23:21,280
growing evidence that this may be a similar phenomenon to what we are seeing as a rare issue

221
0:23:21,280 --> 0:23:25,200
with the AstraZeneca vaccine. And there were a couple publications in the New England Journal

222
0:23:25,200 --> 0:23:31,280
of Medicine that shed some light on what might be happening there. And by comparison, I'll try to

223
0:23:31,280 --> 0:23:39,200
get a connection here. So the original article, thrombotic thrombocytopenia after Chaddox 1,

224
0:23:40,160 --> 0:23:47,520
and COVID-19 vaccination was published. And the authors report that of the 11 original patients,

225
0:23:47,520 --> 0:23:55,200
nine were women, median age of 36, and a range of 22 to 49 years of age. Beginning

226
0:23:55,200 --> 0:24:01,440
five to 16 days after vaccination, the patients presented with one or more thrombotic events

227
0:24:02,160 --> 0:24:07,680
with the exception of one patient who actually presented with a fatal intracranial hemorrhage.

228
0:24:08,480 --> 0:24:14,160
Of the patients with one or more thrombotic events, nine had cerebral venous thrombosis,

229
0:24:14,160 --> 0:24:20,320
three had spanknic vein thrombosis, three had pulmonary embolism, four had other thrombosis,

230
0:24:20,320 --> 0:24:25,920
and of these patients six died, five patients had disseminated intravascular coagulation.

231
0:24:26,720 --> 0:24:34,640
Now the authors used a standard ELISA to detect these platelet activating antibodies against

232
0:24:34,640 --> 0:24:42,800
PF4 and a modified PF4 enhanced platelet activation test to detect platelet activating antibodies

233
0:24:42,800 --> 0:24:49,520
under various reaction conditions. Included in this testing were samples from patients who had blood

234
0:24:49,520 --> 0:24:55,760
samples referred for investigation of these vaccine-associated thrombotic events with 28

235
0:24:55,760 --> 0:25:03,120
testing positive on a screen. And so the authors suggest that we refer to this as vaccine-induced

236
0:25:03,120 --> 0:25:10,640
immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia. So that, the ITT. Same addition, there was a brief report,

237
0:25:10,640 --> 0:25:18,320
very similar name, thrombosis and thrombocytopenia after Chaddox1 and COVID-19 vaccination.

238
0:25:19,040 --> 0:25:25,360
And they really came to the same conclusion. So what is going on here? What is this PF4?

239
0:25:26,160 --> 0:25:35,360
So PF4 is platelet factor 4, or also known as chemokine CXCl4. It's a protein that's found in

240
0:25:35,360 --> 0:25:42,720
the alpha granules of platelets. And it's involved in the clotting cascade. So we see a very similar

241
0:25:42,720 --> 0:25:47,280
phenomenon rarely with a medicine we use called heparin. So it's very similar. You may have heard

242
0:25:47,280 --> 0:25:55,280
the term hit or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. And what we're seeing here is really a consumption

243
0:25:56,240 --> 0:26:01,840
of our platelets followed by, well, bleeding in one instance, but in most cases, clotting.

244
0:26:01,840 --> 0:26:08,800
And we do feel, you know, I have to say, there is a smoking gun here. It looks like there is a

245
0:26:08,800 --> 0:26:13,760
connection. It looks, and we will see the true numbers right now. We're talking about one in a

246
0:26:13,760 --> 0:26:20,640
million. AstraZeneca is about one in 600,000. So as we go forward, we'll have to see what the

247
0:26:20,640 --> 0:26:25,520
numbers are. Now, does it make sense for them to have pause from a scientific point of view? Yes.

248
0:26:25,520 --> 0:26:34,240
If we are able to pause for another week or so, we will actually have that 13 days after the last

249
0:26:34,240 --> 0:26:39,840
J&J was given in the US. We'll be able to see if there's any more of these events. And then we

250
0:26:39,840 --> 0:26:45,360
can revisit this. And on the call today, they actually talked about several options here. One

251
0:26:45,360 --> 0:26:50,400
was to just put this in context and say, okay, the rate is, let's say, 1,500,000, whatever they

252
0:26:50,400 --> 0:26:56,880
want to say. There may be the ability to say, this is isolated to individuals under the age of 50.

253
0:26:56,880 --> 0:27:03,040
This may be isolated to women. So there may may be discussions about what do we do at the vaccine

254
0:27:03,040 --> 0:27:08,800
relative to restricting or targeting certain populations. So I think it's the right thing to

255
0:27:08,800 --> 0:27:14,720
do. And I think it's also reassuring to see what a robust adverse event reporting system we had.

256
0:27:14,720 --> 0:27:18,240
I know I think we had an email where someone asks like, you know, how many people need to die

257
0:27:18,240 --> 0:27:22,880
before we'll find out about it? I think the answer, as I said, was 1, and that's what it was here.

258
0:27:23,920 --> 0:27:31,120
We had a connection here. One person has died in the entire country. And this has been stopped

259
0:27:31,120 --> 0:27:36,320
until we clarify the issue. Now, people will concern we're in the middle of a pandemic here.

260
0:27:36,320 --> 0:27:39,920
Are we stopping our vaccination efforts? I'm going to give some reassurance to our listeners.

261
0:27:40,720 --> 0:27:47,520
If you look at the number of vaccines that have been given so far, this makes up a small part

262
0:27:47,520 --> 0:27:54,800
of the number of vaccines. As I mentioned, we have given almost 200 million doses of the Pfizer

263
0:27:54,800 --> 0:28:00,800
and the Moderna vaccine. We have given less than 7 million of the J&J vaccine.

264
0:28:01,520 --> 0:28:06,880
And going forward, if anything, we have a vaccine glut, especially getting sort of

265
0:28:06,880 --> 0:28:11,200
looks from around the world. What are you doing with all those vaccines? We expect that we will

266
0:28:11,200 --> 0:28:18,800
have the ability by May 31st to have enough vaccines to fully vaccinate 260 million Americans,

267
0:28:18,800 --> 0:28:24,000
even without J&J being an option. So this was something that we could really do

268
0:28:24,880 --> 0:28:31,120
without making any huge sacrifice or impact on our ongoing, really robust vaccination efforts.

269
0:28:31,120 --> 0:28:35,680
So as we learn more, and I think by next week, we might have a little more information,

270
0:28:35,680 --> 0:28:39,520
the following week, we should have all the information and know where we're headed with this

271
0:28:39,520 --> 0:28:46,400
this challenge. Passive vaccination. We actually have some good news here. We are really moving

272
0:28:46,400 --> 0:28:54,720
forward with monoclonal cocktails. And as well, as about a week ago, the NIH, the National Institute

273
0:28:54,720 --> 0:29:03,520
of Health, is now recommending that monoclonals are part of the treatment. So they are now part

274
0:29:03,520 --> 0:29:10,400
of the NIH's COVID-19 treatment guidelines. And so they are saying for a mile to moderate COVID-19,

275
0:29:11,040 --> 0:29:16,640
who are at risk of worsening disease, they should be treated with monoclonal antibody

276
0:29:16,640 --> 0:29:22,880
cocktail. So that's a pretty strong statement. So I feel bad. I feel like we fall down on the job

277
0:29:22,880 --> 0:29:29,280
here sometimes. I have a couple instances happen. I have a gentleman right now in the ICU who will

278
0:29:29,280 --> 0:29:36,320
probably die. And the situation here, he and his wife were diagnosed. They were offered monoclonals,

279
0:29:36,320 --> 0:29:42,000
maybe not as persuasively as it should have been. The wife said certainly. Two days later,

280
0:29:42,000 --> 0:29:48,000
she was fine. Symptoms resolved. The husband is now in the ICU on ventilator, week three. I don't

281
0:29:48,000 --> 0:29:52,640
think he's going to make it. And that's the second of those stories in just a few weeks here that

282
0:29:52,640 --> 0:29:58,400
I've experienced where two married couple are offered therapy. The wife, maybe women are smarter

283
0:29:58,400 --> 0:30:03,280
than men. Just throwing that out there. Say, yes, the men decide they're going to just see how it goes.

284
0:30:04,800 --> 0:30:09,440
It doesn't always go well. So okay. So what are the news? We've got a few more phase three trial

285
0:30:09,440 --> 0:30:17,200
results. Phase three treatment trial in recently infected asympto, asymptomatic patients showed

286
0:30:17,200 --> 0:30:23,920
regenoron coved. And this is Casa ribbon map with imdebemab significantly reduced progression

287
0:30:23,920 --> 0:30:31,200
to symptomatic COVID-19. So this was another phase three trial. It enrolled 204 individuals

288
0:30:31,200 --> 0:30:39,520
with any COVID-19 symptoms who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, but did not have antibodies at

289
0:30:39,520 --> 0:30:45,120
baseline. And so they were randomized to either receive the regenoron cocktail or placebo. And

290
0:30:45,120 --> 0:30:52,800
they reported that they reduced the overall risk of progression by 31% with a p-value of 0.038.

291
0:30:52,800 --> 0:30:59,600
They also go on to report that the total number of weeks that patients experience symptoms which

292
0:30:59,600 --> 0:31:09,440
decreased by 45% with the cocktail and the viral burden was reduced by more than 90%. So while

293
0:31:09,440 --> 0:31:15,200
not included in the initial analysis plan, they also found that zero of the patients that got

294
0:31:15,840 --> 0:31:22,160
the cocktail compared to six placebo patients ended up in the hospital or visited the ER during

295
0:31:22,160 --> 0:31:28,400
this 29-day efficacy assessment period. And from a safety standpoint, there were no issues.

296
0:31:29,120 --> 0:31:35,520
We also have a phase three prevention trial. And I think this is huge. It was an article

297
0:31:35,520 --> 0:31:40,960
recently looking at people with immune compromise saying, what about these people? What they can't

298
0:31:40,960 --> 0:31:46,400
actually respond well to a vaccine? Is there any way to passively protect them from the virus?

299
0:31:46,400 --> 0:31:53,840
And so there was a phase three prevention trial showing 81% reduced risk of a symptomatic SARS-CoV-2

300
0:31:53,840 --> 0:32:01,200
infections with subcutaneous administration of the regenoron cocktail. So this prevention trial

301
0:32:01,200 --> 0:32:08,160
was a double-blind placebo-controlled trial assessing the effect of the regenoron cocktail

302
0:32:08,160 --> 0:32:14,640
on uninfected individuals without SARS-CoV-2 antibodies or any symptoms who lived in the same

303
0:32:14,640 --> 0:32:21,200
household as an individual who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 within a period of four days prior

304
0:32:21,200 --> 0:32:30,240
to enrollment. So they enrolled 1,505 individuals, pretty much split one-to-one getting the cocktail

305
0:32:30,240 --> 0:32:36,000
versus placebo. And then they followed them out. And remember, this is a subcutaneous injection.

306
0:32:36,000 --> 0:32:43,040
This doesn't have to be IV. It's another way of improving access. They reported 72% protection

307
0:32:43,040 --> 0:32:50,160
against symptomatic infections in the first week and 93% in subsequent weeks p-values with about

308
0:32:50,160 --> 0:32:55,600
three zeros each after the decimal. They also reported, and I think this is important,

309
0:32:55,600 --> 0:33:01,040
an impact on severity of disease. So for those who did go on to get infected,

310
0:33:01,040 --> 0:33:06,720
on average, the individuals who were treated with the cocktails experienced a symptomatic infection

311
0:33:06,720 --> 0:33:12,720
and their symptoms resolved in about a week compared to the placebo group who were sick

312
0:33:12,720 --> 0:33:20,400
on average for three weeks. The infected individuals also cleared the virus faster. So there was a

313
0:33:20,400 --> 0:33:28,080
significant reduction in the days with a high viral load by 90%. And again, from a safety point

314
0:33:28,080 --> 0:33:35,120
of view, there were no concerns here. So what's the future with monoclonals? A couple things to

315
0:33:35,120 --> 0:33:39,760
say here. Is there really this invariant region? And we can just target that if the spike could be

316
0:33:39,760 --> 0:33:45,680
set forever? Can we make this perfect monoclonal and just sit on our laurels? I'm not sure that

317
0:33:45,680 --> 0:33:50,400
that's true. I'm not sure that there is a part of the spike protein that does not vary.

318
0:33:51,600 --> 0:33:56,160
Emailing with David Ho today who does not believe that there's actually a part of the spike that

319
0:33:57,040 --> 0:34:02,960
cannot, will not change. So I think that this is going to be an ongoing challenge. And I've been

320
0:34:02,960 --> 0:34:07,280
reaching out and communicating with my colleagues at UnitedHealth Group about how important it is

321
0:34:07,280 --> 0:34:13,440
that we have regional guidance, regional access to the monoclonal cocktails, the monoclonal therapies

322
0:34:13,440 --> 0:34:19,920
that work the best in a given region based upon which variants are circulating and what resistance

323
0:34:19,920 --> 0:34:26,480
patterns they might have to the different monoclonal. So what's the best thing we can do to stay ahead

324
0:34:26,480 --> 0:34:32,960
of the virus? It's to reduce the opportunity of the virus to replicate and change, which means

325
0:34:32,960 --> 0:34:38,560
mitigation, means vaccination. Period of detectable viral replication, right? This is when that person

326
0:34:38,560 --> 0:34:43,280
comes in positive. Just a little touch on here because I'm going to close with some discussion

327
0:34:43,280 --> 0:34:50,560
of anticoagulation. At this point in time, we're basically saying we have no compelling evidence

328
0:34:50,560 --> 0:34:56,160
that starting people on aspirin, starting people in anticoagulation is helpful. The first week of

329
0:34:56,160 --> 0:35:02,800
illness is the time for monitoring and monoclonals. If they have a specific high risk feature, then,

330
0:35:02,800 --> 0:35:08,560
of course, always use your judgment and the latest clinical data to recommend for your patients.

331
0:35:08,560 --> 0:35:14,560
Their early inflammatory phase, remember that 94% is what we're worried about. So ideally,

332
0:35:14,560 --> 0:35:18,880
we've got a lot of pulse oxes out there in the community. Remember, steroids are not during

333
0:35:18,880 --> 0:35:24,400
the first week. It's during that second week, if needed. And I am going to comment here,

334
0:35:24,400 --> 0:35:28,960
where are we with anticoagulation? Should they end up in the hospital? We are universally

335
0:35:28,960 --> 0:35:34,800
recommending anticoagulation. And I'm going to skip here to the tail end because we're running

336
0:35:34,800 --> 0:35:42,320
long and I apologize. But I just wanted to revisit the post discharge anticoagulation guidelines

337
0:35:42,320 --> 0:35:48,320
because they have evolved over time. And currently, as per the NIH treatment guidelines,

338
0:35:48,320 --> 0:35:54,960
prophylaxis after hospital discharge is not recommended for patients with COVID-19.

339
0:35:55,760 --> 0:36:00,960
There's currently no ash guidelines addressing this issue. There will be, we're working on them.

340
0:36:00,960 --> 0:36:07,040
But I think the consensus has been, as we look at the data, this population is not necessarily

341
0:36:07,040 --> 0:36:12,560
at a higher risk of post discharge clotting complications than your general medical patient.

342
0:36:12,560 --> 0:36:18,720
So use the same post discharge anticoagulation guidance you normally would. Person has cancer.

343
0:36:18,720 --> 0:36:24,560
Person has a clotting propensity. Person has another indication. Go ahead, use anticoagulation.

344
0:36:24,560 --> 0:36:27,920
But if they just came in the hospital for their five days of remdesivir,

345
0:36:28,720 --> 0:36:37,040
for their 10 days of steroids, it may be that offering anticoagulation, the dox, the eliquis,

346
0:36:37,040 --> 0:36:44,080
the zorrelto that may be doing more harm than good. So all right, I will conclude there.

347
0:36:44,080 --> 0:36:47,600
And again, I want to thank everyone. We're just a couple of weeks here left in our American

348
0:36:47,600 --> 0:36:54,320
Society of Tropical Medicine fundraiser. So take a deep breath, go to parasiteswithoutporters.com,

349
0:36:54,320 --> 0:36:59,840
click that donate button, because we are going to, because they were hoping, I see we are going to

350
0:36:59,840 --> 0:37:07,920
support the American Society of Tropical Medicine in creating three annual meeting travel awards

351
0:37:08,480 --> 0:37:14,000
to bring early career women from economically challenged parts of the world to the annual

352
0:37:14,000 --> 0:37:20,480
meeting this fall really helped do something to push their career forward and undo and address a

353
0:37:20,480 --> 0:37:24,640
lot of the inequities that are here. So thank you very much again. Time for a couple of

354
0:37:24,640 --> 0:37:30,320
questions for Daniel. You can send them to Daniel at microbe.tv. The first is from

355
0:37:30,320 --> 0:37:36,320
Jay. My daughter has celiac disease, irritable bowel lactose intolerance and has migraines.

356
0:37:36,320 --> 0:37:40,880
We were so happy when she managed to get the J&J vaccine. She suffered only mild chills

357
0:37:41,440 --> 0:37:46,640
about to switch birth control for one that has no estrogen. But what does one need to be aware of

358
0:37:47,360 --> 0:37:52,160
for symptoms? Yeah, yeah, that's actually interesting. You know, the, I'm not sure where

359
0:37:52,160 --> 0:37:56,800
exactly the question is going, but I'll go with it anyway. My daughter actually sent me a graphic

360
0:37:56,800 --> 0:38:01,520
looking at the risk of clotting complications with different therapies. And one of the things

361
0:38:01,520 --> 0:38:07,360
in there was birth control, right? Birth control can actually increase a woman's risk

362
0:38:07,920 --> 0:38:14,400
of having clotting issues. We definitely strongly recommend women on oral contraceptive pills do

363
0:38:14,400 --> 0:38:21,360
not smoke. Smoking is another issue. You know, if we're concerned here about the J&J complications,

364
0:38:21,360 --> 0:38:26,320
I will be reassuring. You know, we're looking at this being less than the risk of getting

365
0:38:26,320 --> 0:38:30,720
struck by lightning, certainly much safer than driving to and from a vaccine appointment.

366
0:38:31,840 --> 0:38:37,760
But everyone, it looks like either acutely came in with a severe headache or soon thereafter

367
0:38:37,760 --> 0:38:42,800
developed headache. So we're advising people after the J&J vaccine across the board,

368
0:38:43,520 --> 0:38:48,880
if you develop a severe headache, if you have trouble breathing, if you have abdominal pain,

369
0:38:48,880 --> 0:38:53,920
then get evaluated. And we can actually do blood work. We can, we can sort out whether or not this

370
0:38:53,920 --> 0:38:59,840
is a significant concern. I know we had a ton of individuals, the ERs, over the last couple days,

371
0:39:00,320 --> 0:39:04,880
you know, worried about these issues. But again, this is very rare. So I really want to

372
0:39:04,880 --> 0:39:10,720
reinforce that. There's no recommended treatment at this point. We're not recommending putting

373
0:39:10,720 --> 0:39:15,680
an umbrella on aspirin or anticoagulation with an event as rare as this seems to be.

374
0:39:15,680 --> 0:39:19,760
We're more likely to do harm than than anything beneficial.

375
0:39:19,760 --> 0:39:24,480
All right, Mary writes in a recent clinical update, you said if a school plan results in lots of

376
0:39:24,480 --> 0:39:28,320
potential exposure, then the plan is not a good one. The school needs a better plan.

377
0:39:28,320 --> 0:39:33,200
I'm a high school teacher. We have been doing cohorted hybrid days in September. We're being

378
0:39:33,200 --> 0:39:38,560
forced to come back full in person after a few weeks in a few weeks instead of 12 kids in a room

379
0:39:38,560 --> 0:39:44,640
with six foot distancing will now have 25 to 28 kids in a room with three foot. The CDC guidelines

380
0:39:44,640 --> 0:39:49,920
say anyone within six feet for more than 15 minutes would be considered a close contact would have

381
0:39:49,920 --> 0:39:54,560
to quarantine. In that case, a single positive student in six classes throughout the day could

382
0:39:54,560 --> 0:40:00,080
yield as many as 36 contacts in the building, given the limitations of space in our building

383
0:40:00,080 --> 0:40:04,400
and the CDC guidelines on close contacts. I don't see how there could be a return to a school plan

384
0:40:04,400 --> 0:40:09,040
that does not result in a lot of potential exposures. Do you have any advice on this?

385
0:40:09,040 --> 0:40:14,800
This is an excellent question and I think hits right on what I talked about. A lot of parents

386
0:40:14,800 --> 0:40:19,760
had this as a disconnect. You just told me that if the children are three feet apart and wearing

387
0:40:19,760 --> 0:40:26,000
masks, that is not a risky behavior. But yet you're telling me that if the kids are three feet apart

388
0:40:26,000 --> 0:40:30,240
and someone has COVID, if they're both wearing masks, it doesn't matter. It's an exposure. So

389
0:40:30,240 --> 0:40:35,040
there really is a disconnect here. So I know some local health departments have worked with the

390
0:40:35,040 --> 0:40:40,560
school and said, no, this doesn't make any sense. But this is reaching out to the CDC.

391
0:40:41,920 --> 0:40:46,160
We need this guidance on a national level. I think it's great now that the CDC is here

392
0:40:47,200 --> 0:40:51,520
sort of back giving us really helpful guidance. And I think it's just a matter of getting the

393
0:40:51,520 --> 0:40:56,960
guidance updated to be consistent with what we now know. Mask wearing can be successfully

394
0:40:56,960 --> 0:41:02,960
enforced in the schools. If the kids are wearing masks, if you as a teacher and the kids are wearing

395
0:41:02,960 --> 0:41:09,680
a mask and you're keeping this separation, this is a very low risk activity. Also go get vaccinated,

396
0:41:09,680 --> 0:41:14,720
right? That's that's one of the biggest things we can do here. And if you look at our high schools,

397
0:41:14,720 --> 0:41:22,160
a chunk of the kids, right, or 60 and 17. So the more people you get vaccinated, the better,

398
0:41:22,160 --> 0:41:27,520
good ventilation systems, three feet is going to give you that 80% reduction. You throw a mask on

399
0:41:27,520 --> 0:41:32,720
either side of that three feet. Yeah, otherwise, I think your math is exactly what I worry about.

400
0:41:33,440 --> 0:41:37,440
You know, one child, six different periods, every time they're sitting surrounded by eight

401
0:41:37,440 --> 0:41:42,400
kids. Next thing you know, everyone's in quarantine. We were only in school for a day.

402
0:41:42,400 --> 0:41:49,520
One more from Ellen who talks about the discussion we had about pulling back on the

403
0:41:50,080 --> 0:41:55,680
I am injection for the vaccine. And she has a question, which is what might be the consequences

404
0:41:55,680 --> 0:42:01,680
of inadvertent IV administration of the vaccine? Someone I know came to me with a concern that

405
0:42:01,680 --> 0:42:06,880
one of the vaccines he gave did, in fact, go IV, which he believes based on feel of having hit a

406
0:42:06,880 --> 0:42:13,040
vessel by followed by continuing to inject before his brain and muscles had time to react to this

407
0:42:13,040 --> 0:42:17,520
unexpected sensation. I realize there's no data, but would appreciate thoughts on what would be

408
0:42:17,520 --> 0:42:23,440
theoretically expected in this case. The vaccine in question was MRNA. But I suppose in either case,

409
0:42:23,440 --> 0:42:28,160
we would have the recipe for spike protein, as I call it, within circulation. Would this lead to

410
0:42:28,160 --> 0:42:33,760
uptake and spike production within the vessels? If so, could this be related to rare clotting

411
0:42:33,760 --> 0:42:39,040
issues seen with AZ and now J and J? And would it move out of the bloodstream and be used in a

412
0:42:39,040 --> 0:42:45,200
similar but less localized way than in IM? Your insight is always much appreciated.

413
0:42:46,640 --> 0:42:52,720
Yes, I am speculating here, but I will share like what my experience. So, you know, I was doing a

414
0:42:52,720 --> 0:42:57,920
lot of vaccines this last week. We did over 300 last week. We actually did over 100 J and J just

415
0:42:57,920 --> 0:43:05,360
Friday, right before the pause was triggered. And, you know, I always ask the people before I give

416
0:43:05,360 --> 0:43:10,720
them a shot, I say, oh, are you a bleeder? And one of my partners, Nujali, who I mentioned earlier,

417
0:43:10,720 --> 0:43:15,520
she was like, well, why do you do that? And some people, you give them a shot and they bleed.

418
0:43:15,520 --> 0:43:19,760
The majority of the people we are giving these shots to, when you're done, they don't even need

419
0:43:19,760 --> 0:43:24,320
a bandaid. They're fine. But a certain percent of them will bleed. Sometimes it prompts them to let

420
0:43:24,320 --> 0:43:28,480
me know that they're on a blood thinner or something like that. But sometimes you do the shot and

421
0:43:28,480 --> 0:43:32,560
actually they really start bleeding and you have to apply pressure and put a bandaid, which is not

422
0:43:32,560 --> 0:43:38,480
consistent with this concept that we have been told that the deltoid, there's no blood vessels

423
0:43:38,480 --> 0:43:45,600
there. It's very small capillaries. There is some vascularity to a deltoid, particularly in

424
0:43:45,600 --> 0:43:51,840
someone who's maybe more active, et cetera. So I don't think we're quite clear on what's going on

425
0:43:51,840 --> 0:43:56,320
here. You know, significant bleeding sometimes in some of these individuals suggesting a larger

426
0:43:56,320 --> 0:44:00,880
vessel than, you know, we've sort of been led to believe when we talk about the pulling back the

427
0:44:00,880 --> 0:44:07,200
plunger. But let's move on to the next level. The issues that we're seeing do not appear to be

428
0:44:07,200 --> 0:44:12,880
that the vaccine is nestled in the blood system. What we're actually seeing is an immune response.

429
0:44:12,880 --> 0:44:19,280
We're seeing six to 13 days later. We're seeing antibody production. These antibodies are against

430
0:44:19,280 --> 0:44:26,320
a certain target, PF4, so platelet factor four. I don't necessarily think getting in the circulation

431
0:44:26,320 --> 0:44:32,960
explains it. If anything, a good robust immune response is what explains this. So I understand

432
0:44:32,960 --> 0:44:38,320
the concept of pulling back on the plunger, but I'm not sure I would understand the mechanism.

433
0:44:38,320 --> 0:44:44,240
That's COVID-19 clinical update number 58 with Dr. Daniel Griffin. Thanks again, Daniel.

434
0:44:44,240 --> 0:45:11,280
Oh, thank you so much, and everyone be safe.
