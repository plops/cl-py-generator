0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:06,880
This week in virology, the podcast about viruses, the kind that make you sick.

2
0:00:10,160 --> 0:00:21,520
From Microbe TV, this is Twiv, this week in virology. Episode 701 recorded on December 31, 2020.

3
0:00:21,520 --> 0:00:28,000
I'm Vincent Rackeniello, and you're listening to the podcast All About Viruses. Joining me today

4
0:00:28,000 --> 0:00:36,880
from New York, Daniel Griffin. Hello, everyone. Daniel, it is our 43rd update from you this year.

5
0:00:36,880 --> 0:00:44,960
It's the end of 2020. That's it. Good read-ins. Not to you, Vincent, but to 2020. It has been

6
0:00:45,920 --> 0:00:50,400
what an awful year. It really has. But let's get to it. We got a lot to do today.

7
0:00:51,200 --> 0:00:56,080
So when this drops, it's actually going to be New Year's Day. So we're recording on New Year's Eve.

8
0:00:56,080 --> 0:01:00,720
This is going to be dropping, I guess, on New Year's, so the 1st or 2nd January.

9
0:01:01,360 --> 0:01:08,160
So let's start with our quotation. Should old acquaintance be forgot and never thought upon,

10
0:01:08,720 --> 0:01:15,280
the flames of love extinguished and fully passed and gone, is thy sweet heart not grown so cold,

11
0:01:16,080 --> 0:01:22,560
that loving breast of thine, that thou canst never once reflect on old, long,

12
0:01:22,560 --> 0:01:28,880
zine. And I'll say, old, long, zine, lovely translates as days gone by. So that's that thou

13
0:01:28,880 --> 0:01:36,400
canst never once reflect on days gone by. So this is by Robert Burns. And for me, this is actually

14
0:01:36,400 --> 0:01:45,280
sort of a very, very appropriate poem, shall I say, turned into a song because it was actually,

15
0:01:45,280 --> 0:01:51,360
I was in Scotland. I was in Glasgow in the end of January. And actually, I was there for

16
0:01:51,360 --> 0:01:58,800
Burns Day where they celebrate the Laureate poet, Robert Burns. And that was right before the Chinese

17
0:01:58,800 --> 0:02:08,880
New Year, right before the sky did fall. So patient updates. You know, I think that everyone is aware

18
0:02:08,880 --> 0:02:15,440
of how difficult it has gotten over the last bit of time. And you know, Christmas was really tough

19
0:02:15,440 --> 0:02:21,120
for me to see, you know, eight families having lost someone on that day. And I guess somewhere

20
0:02:21,120 --> 0:02:26,160
in my mind, I had this idea that, you know, Christmas is a day when people shouldn't die,

21
0:02:26,160 --> 0:02:30,480
you know, if there's any sort of greater power than myself in the world, greater power than all

22
0:02:30,480 --> 0:02:35,840
of us in the world. And so just really traumatic that people continue to die, just, you know,

23
0:02:35,840 --> 0:02:42,800
record numbers, growing numbers every day. But what I want to do today, and I know that people are,

24
0:02:42,800 --> 0:02:47,040
people are busy, and I was trying to make this the clinical update for the busy clinician,

25
0:02:47,040 --> 0:02:52,000
but I know a lot of other people listen. But at a year end, I wanted to do an update on what

26
0:02:52,000 --> 0:03:00,080
we've learned this last year. And it really has been a credible year, sort of back and forth,

27
0:03:00,080 --> 0:03:05,280
from really early on in the year, when reports, you know, the risk of coronavirus in the U.S.

28
0:03:05,280 --> 0:03:08,960
is miniscule, worry about the real and present danger of seasonal flu,

29
0:03:10,000 --> 0:03:16,000
articles, coronavirus is bad, comparing it to the flu is worse, to shutdowns, the mask wars,

30
0:03:16,000 --> 0:03:20,080
people threatening to drive pickup trucks into the building if they're, if they're dead,

31
0:03:20,080 --> 0:03:26,480
did not get 8CQ to threats if we did give 8CQ. And then some very strange stuff about bleach

32
0:03:26,480 --> 0:03:32,240
and swallowing flashlights and rattlesnake venom. So we have actually learned a lot,

33
0:03:32,240 --> 0:03:37,760
and let's go through it, really rapid fire. So we'll start off with the pre-exposure period.

34
0:03:38,800 --> 0:03:43,040
And I'm going to talk a lot, actually, about non-pharmaceutical interventions,

35
0:03:43,040 --> 0:03:47,360
which actually I spend a lot of time doing. I'm sort of waiting for, I don't know, maybe the

36
0:03:47,360 --> 0:03:51,840
pharmaceutical bots to be like, Dr. Griffin, why do you talk about so much about non-pharmaceutical

37
0:03:51,840 --> 0:03:56,320
interventions? Why don't you push our drugs a little bit more? But oh, well, I haven't seen that

38
0:03:56,320 --> 0:04:02,160
happen yet. So let's go through it. One, we have a really broad appreciation. Not everyone's on

39
0:04:02,160 --> 0:04:08,560
board, but I'll say a broad appreciation that masks, protect others, and actually they protect

40
0:04:08,560 --> 0:04:15,120
us as well. And please cover those nose holes, unless you're a, I guess, just a mouth breather.

41
0:04:16,640 --> 0:04:21,840
Physical distancing, 6 feet or greater helps. Remember, there's no magical wall at 6 feet. I

42
0:04:21,840 --> 0:04:28,080
think people are getting a little more sophisticated. 6 feet is really what we recommend, 7, 8. It's

43
0:04:28,080 --> 0:04:34,640
exponential, the decrease. There's nothing magic about 6 feet. And if you lean into 5, 4, you're

44
0:04:34,640 --> 0:04:38,960
starting to really dramatically increase your risk. If you can back up, that's better.

45
0:04:39,840 --> 0:04:45,440
Outdoors is safer than indoors. We have a number of studies on this. And it's about a 20-fold

46
0:04:45,440 --> 0:04:51,920
difference in your risk of getting infected indoors versus outdoors. But it's not absolute,

47
0:04:51,920 --> 0:04:58,880
right? Air exchange matters. So indoor at someone's house, a suburban home without good ventilation,

48
0:04:58,880 --> 0:05:04,000
without good air exchange, that's about the highest risk. I bring that up right here around

49
0:05:04,000 --> 0:05:11,280
the holidays. Limiting the size of gathering reduces risks, right? Each extra person

50
0:05:11,280 --> 0:05:17,040
is one extra person who could be bringing the virus into your circle. So the fewer people are

51
0:05:17,040 --> 0:05:22,080
the better. You know, I know this is tough for people that, like hanging out with other people,

52
0:05:22,080 --> 0:05:27,040
which is pretty much all of us. Washing hands, I'm hoping this is here's stay.

53
0:05:28,240 --> 0:05:32,720
Hygiene helps. We do know that we overdid it a little bit with surfaces, your risk of getting

54
0:05:32,720 --> 0:05:39,920
COVID from a surface is really low. We say less than 10% of cases are spread that way. This is really

55
0:05:39,920 --> 0:05:44,320
person-to-person. You're getting it through the air. You're breathing it in. You're getting

56
0:05:44,320 --> 0:05:50,720
it on a mucous membranes. Frequent testing, even of asymptomatic people, can save lives. And we're

57
0:05:50,720 --> 0:05:58,240
seeing more and more data supporting that perspective. Symptom checking helps. But as we now know,

58
0:05:58,240 --> 0:06:04,160
much spread is done by the asymptomatic or the pre-symptomatic. Not saying you shouldn't

59
0:06:04,160 --> 0:06:08,480
symptom check, but just saying we need to keep in mind that that person who looks like they're

60
0:06:08,480 --> 0:06:16,480
doing fine could have the infection. Remember, this is an invisible thing. Being healthy,

61
0:06:16,480 --> 0:06:22,000
eating right, exercising, not carrying that extra weight, optimizing your medical conditions,

62
0:06:22,800 --> 0:06:28,000
not walking around vitamin deficient. These may all help decrease your risk of not only getting

63
0:06:28,000 --> 0:06:35,040
infected, but also surviving if you do get infected. And now we've got good old or, shall I say,

64
0:06:35,040 --> 0:06:41,040
good modern, highly effective vaccines that we're adding to this pre-exposure period.

65
0:06:41,040 --> 0:06:45,120
And in the future, when we actually get to it, I'll talk about the idea of using not only the

66
0:06:45,120 --> 0:06:51,200
active vaccines, but maybe even passive vaccines to try to give people antibodies during high-risk

67
0:06:51,200 --> 0:06:56,720
periods. So there's some ongoing studies there. Schools. We've learned that we can open schools

68
0:06:56,720 --> 0:07:03,680
safely, but also that we can do it unsafely to do its safest cost money. We actually have some

69
0:07:03,680 --> 0:07:09,200
estimates about how much money needs to be spent. If you're going to try to do this in a safer manner,

70
0:07:10,000 --> 0:07:15,840
the safer openings involve limiting class sizes, physical distancing, wherein those masks,

71
0:07:15,840 --> 0:07:22,800
proper ventilation, increasing staffing, hygiene stations, and testing. The whole idea of the

72
0:07:22,800 --> 0:07:27,840
kids taking off their masks to eat in school. That's still an issue for me. I mean, that's

73
0:07:27,840 --> 0:07:32,240
indoor dining. So if the parents shouldn't be doing that, I'm not sure the kids should.

74
0:07:33,040 --> 0:07:36,400
Do I put that as a challenge to the schools? I think I've mentioned there's some schools

75
0:07:36,400 --> 0:07:42,560
here on the South Shore. Did a kids go in the morning, they go home, eat their lunch at home,

76
0:07:42,560 --> 0:07:47,120
another group is doing it in the afternoon. They're doing sort of a hybrid model with remote learning.

77
0:07:47,120 --> 0:07:53,760
I worry. January, February, with really these rising rates, the whole idea of having kids take

78
0:07:53,760 --> 0:08:00,400
their masks off and eat inside the schools, have teachers or higher risk older individuals,

79
0:08:02,240 --> 0:08:06,880
basically in a closed indoor setting with kids with masks off. So I just throw that out there.

80
0:08:06,880 --> 0:08:12,640
We've learned a lot about how this virus is spread. Incubation period, right? So now you've

81
0:08:12,640 --> 0:08:19,360
been exposed and we really have a good sense of what is a high risk exposure. This is your

82
0:08:19,360 --> 0:08:25,440
within that six feet for 15 minutes or longer. It's cumulative, right? You can't walk away and

83
0:08:25,440 --> 0:08:34,800
reset the clock. So 15 minutes cumulative. No mask indoors, as mentioned, is higher risk than outdoors.

84
0:08:36,160 --> 0:08:41,760
Being around a person who actually is in that zone of very high levels of virus. So this is about

85
0:08:41,760 --> 0:08:48,000
two days about, but the WHO and CDC will contact trace four days prior, but about two days prior

86
0:08:48,000 --> 0:08:53,680
to symptom onset. And really, in most cases, for about four to five days post symptom onset,

87
0:08:53,680 --> 0:09:00,000
but that can go out for about as far as 10 days in your mild outpatient cases and as far out as

88
0:09:00,000 --> 0:09:06,480
20 days in your more severe cases. So keep those in mind. Things have been sort of updated and

89
0:09:06,480 --> 0:09:12,720
made simpler. So you've been exposed. We're talking about quarantines to 10 days. We're

90
0:09:12,720 --> 0:09:18,800
also talking about isolation of the infected out to 10 days. So even though we know that

91
0:09:18,800 --> 0:09:23,840
incubation period is really two to 14 days, there's only a few percent past 10. We're trying to keep

92
0:09:23,840 --> 0:09:28,320
it simple. We're trying to come up with something that is reasonable enough that people will actually

93
0:09:28,320 --> 0:09:35,440
follow our guidance. So you get exposed. Anytime the next two to 14 days, you could develop symptoms.

94
0:09:35,440 --> 0:09:40,800
You could become positive. Remember, half of the cases are going to become positive.

95
0:09:40,800 --> 0:09:44,320
They're going to have virus. They're going to potentially spread virus. Never have symptoms.

96
0:09:44,320 --> 0:09:50,800
So we've been learning a lot here. Now, what about this period of detectable viral replication?

97
0:09:50,800 --> 0:09:57,360
So someone's been exposed. The virus is replicating. It is now replicated to the point that it is

98
0:09:57,360 --> 0:10:01,840
detectable. A couple of things here that I really want to try out. I'm going to really work hard

99
0:10:01,840 --> 0:10:08,160
to get the word out. What can we do to keep people out of the hospital? And there is only one

100
0:10:08,160 --> 0:10:15,520
evidence-based intervention at this point. I'll get some emails on that, but I'm going to say that.

101
0:10:16,320 --> 0:10:22,320
And this is an EUA access therapy. This is a pharmaceutical. So pharmaceutical companies

102
0:10:22,320 --> 0:10:28,880
don't have to send me a hate mail anymore. Monoclonal antibody. This is the bamblinibimab

103
0:10:28,880 --> 0:10:35,520
or the bambam made by Eli Lilly. This is the Regeneron cocktail. Ideally, you give this to

104
0:10:35,520 --> 0:10:42,160
someone in the first week out to maybe the first 10 days from symptom onset. If you get this to

105
0:10:42,160 --> 0:10:49,760
people within that period of time, at least the data we have predicts about 75% reduction with the

106
0:10:49,760 --> 0:10:55,760
bamblinibimab of them progressing to require any medical support. So you take someone who's high

107
0:10:55,760 --> 0:11:01,360
risk, we'll say 10% or higher chance of ending up in the hospital. They get this infusion. It takes

108
0:11:01,360 --> 0:11:07,200
an hour. 75% reduction in them ending up in the hospital. And that's key as we know, because people

109
0:11:07,200 --> 0:11:15,040
end up in the hospital, things don't often go well. We also know that telemedicine, pulse oximetry

110
0:11:15,040 --> 0:11:21,760
can really help keep track of these people. So when someone has this diagnosis, we know that

111
0:11:21,760 --> 0:11:27,680
80% and 90% of people can be managed out of the hospital, maybe even a little bit more if we really

112
0:11:27,680 --> 0:11:33,760
get better access for the monoclonal antibodies out there. And what do we do during that first week?

113
0:11:34,640 --> 0:11:41,440
The biggest thing is nothing. No antibiotics, no steroids. We can make things worse during that

114
0:11:41,440 --> 0:11:47,280
first week. We can't really make them better. We want to monitor these people. If you have the

115
0:11:47,280 --> 0:11:52,480
ability to give them a pulse oximeter, or somehow get them access to a pulse oximeter, if they can

116
0:11:52,480 --> 0:11:58,880
track, make sure that oxygen saturation stays above 90%, then boom, they hit week to that critical

117
0:11:58,880 --> 0:12:05,280
week. And then if you have not gotten them access to the monoclonals, or even if you have, then you

118
0:12:05,280 --> 0:12:10,800
start making that decision about is this someone I can safely manage outpatient. Once you get into

119
0:12:10,800 --> 0:12:19,200
the second week, if the pulse ox drops below 94%, steroids potentially can play a role. The standard

120
0:12:19,200 --> 0:12:25,920
would be your dexamethasone, six milligrams, POQ day, times 10 days, prednisone 40 milligrams

121
0:12:25,920 --> 0:12:31,120
would be an equivalent. And then watch them really closely. Most people are going to do okay.

122
0:12:32,240 --> 0:12:38,880
Across the board, an aspirin a day is reasonable, but we don't have really clear guidance on the

123
0:12:38,880 --> 0:12:43,280
best way to protect these people against clots. Your high-risk people will get into this later.

124
0:12:43,280 --> 0:12:50,080
You might consider other therapies. All right. Right at this point, I'm going to jump into the

125
0:12:50,080 --> 0:12:54,480
early inflammatory phase. And later on, don't worry, we'll go back and talk about vaccinations,

126
0:12:54,480 --> 0:13:00,080
active vaccinations. The early inflammatory phase, I started to drift into this with our

127
0:13:00,080 --> 0:13:05,200
outpatient folks, because remember, and I think this is news to some people, but not to our

128
0:13:05,200 --> 0:13:11,600
12 listeners, 80 to 90% of patients can be managed outside the hospitals. Some of those

129
0:13:11,600 --> 0:13:16,000
patients end up in the hospital. You've done all these things. They end up in the hospital.

130
0:13:16,000 --> 0:13:21,520
What do you do? At the point a person gets admitted, there's a number of labs we currently recommend

131
0:13:21,520 --> 0:13:27,040
help risk stratify, help manage them. A CBC, a complete blood count with differential,

132
0:13:27,040 --> 0:13:36,640
a comprehensive metabolic panel, a ferritin, a procalcitonin, a D-dimer, a PTPTT. These are

133
0:13:36,640 --> 0:13:43,920
our coagulation tests, a C-reactive protein, a triponin, and a chest x-ray at an EKG is reasonable.

134
0:13:43,920 --> 0:13:50,640
We really don't need a lot of CAT scans, but we do need a few bits of critical information.

135
0:13:50,640 --> 0:13:54,720
Part of that information is going to come from our labs, but part of it's going to come from

136
0:13:54,720 --> 0:14:00,720
history. I really want to know, can we pinpoint the date of symptom onset? When did this start?

137
0:14:00,720 --> 0:14:06,480
Because timing matters. What was the date of your first positive COVID test? This is going to help

138
0:14:06,480 --> 0:14:12,640
us in management. How are you doing with your oxygen level? Are they above or below 90%?

139
0:14:12,640 --> 0:14:18,800
If it dropped below 90%, how much oxygen is it taking to keep those saturations greater than 90%?

140
0:14:18,800 --> 0:14:24,320
Is it nasal cannula? Is it venturing a mask? Is it face mask? And we'll get back to that.

141
0:14:25,760 --> 0:14:31,360
What about how much weight you're carrying? What is your BMI? Is it greater or less than 30? How's

142
0:14:31,360 --> 0:14:37,040
that kidney function? How is your estimated GFR creatinine clearance? Is it greater than 30?

143
0:14:37,040 --> 0:14:43,200
What about those LFTs, that AST and ALT? Are they less than five times upper limit of normal?

144
0:14:43,200 --> 0:14:47,040
This is going to affect what medicines we're going to consider. What is that

145
0:14:47,040 --> 0:14:51,360
neutrophil lymphocyte ratio that we get from our complete blood count with differential?

146
0:14:52,160 --> 0:14:57,120
Really nice paper recently showing that that really helps differentiate how people are going to do

147
0:14:57,840 --> 0:15:03,120
and particularly dynamic tracking this over time. Nice to have that ferretin

148
0:15:03,120 --> 0:15:10,240
procalcitonin ratio to help us identify that 10% that subset that has a secondary bacterial

149
0:15:10,240 --> 0:15:15,840
infection. But remember, it is a subset. Are they at increased risk of clotting or bleeding?

150
0:15:15,840 --> 0:15:22,800
That lets us make decisions. If someone has a prior history of a GI bleed or they had an

151
0:15:22,800 --> 0:15:28,080
intracranial bleed, you want to be careful with your anticoagulation there. If the person is obese

152
0:15:28,080 --> 0:15:32,960
and has a prior history of a pulmonary embolism or deep venous thrombosis, that's also going to

153
0:15:32,960 --> 0:15:39,600
guide us in management. Now first, what not to do? And I'm actually, I know I'm going to step on

154
0:15:39,600 --> 0:15:45,680
some toes here, but these are our current recommendations. There are a number of things we are recommending

155
0:15:45,680 --> 0:15:56,400
not to give to people. Avoid unnecessary antibiotics or antimalarials. No HCQ, no dioxocycline, no azithromycin.

156
0:15:57,280 --> 0:16:01,680
We do recommend limiting the use of convalescent plasma. There's no compelling benefit there.

157
0:16:01,680 --> 0:16:08,160
It's a very resource intensive item. And the monoclonal antibody is really the modern convalescent

158
0:16:08,160 --> 0:16:13,200
plasma. It's got everything we want, but not all the clotting factors. And as we've really learned,

159
0:16:13,200 --> 0:16:18,080
I think from all this timing matters. Once the person ends up in the hospital, you've missed your

160
0:16:18,080 --> 0:16:26,880
window. There's really a defined window. Anticoagulation, it's a really, we're learning here. Some people

161
0:16:26,880 --> 0:16:32,640
are actually doing some, they call them improve scores, really trying to risk stratify to make

162
0:16:32,640 --> 0:16:39,120
this a little bit more sophisticated. But in general, I'll say prophylactic dose anticoagulation

163
0:16:39,120 --> 0:16:46,480
is recommended over intermediate or full dose, except on a case-by-case basis. When, as we say,

164
0:16:46,480 --> 0:16:52,160
one might escalate to full therapeutic dosing if the clotting risk is elevated and the bleeding

165
0:16:52,160 --> 0:16:57,920
risk is low. And what does that mean? And here we get into the weeds a little. When we talk about

166
0:16:57,920 --> 0:17:05,680
low molecular weight heparin, prophylactic dosing is anoxoperin, 40 milligrams, sub-Q once a day.

167
0:17:06,240 --> 0:17:10,800
The person is over a certain body weight, over a certain BMI. We talked about that earlier.

168
0:17:10,800 --> 0:17:19,200
That might be up to BID. But in a normal BMI individual, the intermediate dosing that comes

169
0:17:19,200 --> 0:17:24,160
partly out of, I'll say, the OBGYN literature, the 40 milligrams twice a day, that's intermediate

170
0:17:24,160 --> 0:17:30,480
dosing that's not recommended. And in some cases, as mentioned, we might do full dose, which would be

171
0:17:30,480 --> 0:17:37,840
the milligram per kilogram twice a day. For the obese patients, that BMI greater than 30,

172
0:17:37,840 --> 0:17:42,320
as mentioned, you're going up to BID. That's not intermediate. That's prophylactic dosing

173
0:17:42,320 --> 0:17:48,160
adjusted for body weight, for your dialysis patients. So you need to know that renal function if it's

174
0:17:48,160 --> 0:17:55,040
less than 50, 15, or they're on dialysis, then we actually consider using heparin with concerns

175
0:17:55,040 --> 0:17:59,840
about accumulation of metabolites with the low molecular weight heparin. And when we do the heparin,

176
0:17:59,840 --> 0:18:07,680
it's 5,000 units, sub-Q, and that's going to be every eight or 12 hours. Certain circumstances,

177
0:18:07,680 --> 0:18:12,560
we might use our direct acting anticoagulants. These are people may be familiar with the

178
0:18:12,560 --> 0:18:19,840
zorelto or the eliquest, the 10 milligrams once a day, the eliquest 2.5 milligrams twice a day.

179
0:18:20,560 --> 0:18:26,480
Again, these things are adjusted based upon renal function and other factors. And in some cases,

180
0:18:26,480 --> 0:18:32,480
people are just using the baby aspirin, 81 milligrams POQ day, sometimes just based upon

181
0:18:32,480 --> 0:18:37,440
an overall clinical picture. But some people are actually, as I mentioned, calculating the

182
0:18:37,440 --> 0:18:46,160
improve, so the international medical prevention registry on venous thromboembolism scores. And

183
0:18:46,160 --> 0:18:52,240
then using these and asking questions about was there a previous clot, issues with paralysis,

184
0:18:52,240 --> 0:18:58,000
cancer, are you in the ICU? Is there complete immobilization? Is your age over 60? And then

185
0:18:58,000 --> 0:19:03,120
trying to weigh that against, you know, is there an issue of an ulcer bleeding in the last three

186
0:19:03,120 --> 0:19:07,920
months? Are the platelets less than 50, right? You're going to want to know about that. Are

187
0:19:07,920 --> 0:19:14,480
there issues with the liver? Are there central venous catheter? So this is all getting a little

188
0:19:14,480 --> 0:19:20,800
bit sophisticated. We're learning a little bit more. As we well know, people who are severely ill

189
0:19:20,800 --> 0:19:26,640
with COVID, maybe 30% of them will have significant clots. But if you put them all on full dose

190
0:19:26,640 --> 0:19:31,840
anticoagulation, you might have bleeds in about 8%. So you got to balance this, right? We're not

191
0:19:31,840 --> 0:19:37,360
saying that full dose anticoagulation doesn't prevent the clots. But you may end up with a net

192
0:19:38,320 --> 0:19:43,440
negative mortality. If you go with full dose on everyone, and that's actually come out of some

193
0:19:43,440 --> 0:19:49,760
recent data, which have actually removed in the ICU arms, people from looking at full dose.

194
0:19:49,760 --> 0:19:54,080
We don't know if that applies to people in the general hospital wards, but we are learning,

195
0:19:54,080 --> 0:20:01,040
and this stuff is being studied, I'm going to say finally. Immune modulation, steroids,

196
0:20:01,040 --> 0:20:06,800
recommended only after the first week. So remember, it's not COVID steroids. It's COVID,

197
0:20:06,800 --> 0:20:12,800
second week, hypoxemia, then you consider steroids. And again, you balance it. You want to look at

198
0:20:12,800 --> 0:20:20,560
the whole picture in a frail, elderly individual. You might consider lower doses. You might consider

199
0:20:20,560 --> 0:20:26,640
shorter courses in someone who is more severely ill, maybe carrying more weight. You might consider

200
0:20:26,640 --> 0:20:32,240
a slightly higher dose. And then that 10 days, you're going to use clinical judgment. We talk

201
0:20:32,240 --> 0:20:38,560
about dexamethasone 6 milligrams, whether it's IV or PO. If they're taken oral medicines,

202
0:20:38,560 --> 0:20:44,240
make it oral. There's no reason to add more IV medications, and prednisone 40 milligrams

203
0:20:44,240 --> 0:20:48,160
would be an equivalent. So some degree of flexibility on doses and duration.

204
0:20:49,200 --> 0:20:53,760
What happened to anakinra, the IL-1 inhibition? What happened to serilla mab,

205
0:20:53,760 --> 0:21:02,720
cetuximab, telosilizimab, all our IL-6 blockade? You know, I have to say, we're still waiting to

206
0:21:02,720 --> 0:21:09,040
see any clear compelling mortality benefit here. The literature sort of bore out what we saw

207
0:21:09,040 --> 0:21:14,400
early on. If you give, and I'll say, toselizimab, in the absence of steroids, people initially get

208
0:21:14,400 --> 0:21:21,920
better. But then by 28 days, the mortality is the same. So limited use here. We look at this as

209
0:21:21,920 --> 0:21:27,200
somebody is heading towards a ventilator. Maybe this will be something that temporarily decreases

210
0:21:27,200 --> 0:21:33,520
their oxygen requirements. But unfortunately, we're not really seeing, say, sort of the early

211
0:21:33,520 --> 0:21:40,000
the early optimism panned out. Something is going on with IL-6 that impact on fevers and

212
0:21:40,000 --> 0:21:46,080
hypoxemia in response to IL-6 receptor blockade is interesting. We're still waiting for better

213
0:21:46,080 --> 0:21:53,120
guidance here. Hypoxemia management. How do we keep that oxygen above 90? And I have to say,

214
0:21:53,120 --> 0:21:57,280
this is a huge area. This is why people need to be in the hospital by and large.

215
0:21:59,200 --> 0:22:04,160
The goal is to keep those sets 88, 90% or higher. You don't really need to crank

216
0:22:04,160 --> 0:22:09,760
them much above that. This gets very sophisticated. And this is actually where our respiratory

217
0:22:09,760 --> 0:22:16,160
colleagues get involved. You start with nasal cannula. Two liters, four liters, you might get up to

218
0:22:16,160 --> 0:22:21,120
eight liters, then escalates to something called a venturi mask, not available in all centers,

219
0:22:21,120 --> 0:22:27,360
but allows us to actually titrate oxygen saturations a little bit. Then we go up to non-rebreather,

220
0:22:27,360 --> 0:22:34,640
high flow nasal cannula, things non-invasive ventilatory methods like BIPAP, pruning. We have

221
0:22:34,640 --> 0:22:40,000
good evidence that that makes a difference, even a mortality benefit, because it's helping us keep

222
0:22:40,000 --> 0:22:44,960
people off the ventilators. This is something even we're doing in the outpatient setting.

223
0:22:44,960 --> 0:22:50,080
One of my colleagues, Ken, that was on a call with earlier today, was bringing up that this is

224
0:22:50,080 --> 0:22:53,440
working in the outpatient setting. You've got an individual, you're trying to keep them out of the

225
0:22:53,440 --> 0:22:59,520
hospital. Maybe they're even on home oxygen. They're laying on their belly. They're sleeping on their

226
0:22:59,520 --> 0:23:05,360
belly. That actually helps with the ventilation perfusion mismatch. In another note, I'll throw

227
0:23:05,360 --> 0:23:10,320
out there that probably a lot of us have experienced, but make sure I share this. Often the pulse

228
0:23:10,320 --> 0:23:18,080
oximeter readings can be inaccurate. If it doesn't make sense to you, consider doing an arterial

229
0:23:18,080 --> 0:23:26,560
blood gas. Anti-viral therapeutics. Less and less excitement over remdesivir as time goes by,

230
0:23:26,560 --> 0:23:32,080
I want to be honest. One of the hospitals here has even started to limit the criteria. For a

231
0:23:32,080 --> 0:23:37,360
while there, anyone who comes in seemed to get remdesivir. It didn't matter if they were hypoxic,

232
0:23:37,360 --> 0:23:41,520
but now the guidelines were just updated. These were actually, I have to say, nice updated

233
0:23:41,520 --> 0:23:46,400
guidelines. You actually saw who was involved in the decision-making, very evidence-based guidelines.

234
0:23:47,040 --> 0:23:53,360
Basically saying remdesivir, if people met the criteria in the one trial that showed benefit,

235
0:23:53,360 --> 0:24:00,080
so hypoxic within the first 14 days. The kidney function, you had a GFR of greater than 30.

236
0:24:00,720 --> 0:24:06,000
The LFTs were less than five times upper limit normal. Then it was five days or less. If you

237
0:24:06,000 --> 0:24:10,320
start the five days and they really are doing better, you don't have to keep them in the hospital

238
0:24:10,320 --> 0:24:17,760
to keep giving them this medicine. Miscellaneous things. We're still seeing a lot of our patients

239
0:24:17,760 --> 0:24:24,320
of vitamin C and thiamine and zinc and vitamin D. People did comment last week that I spoke

240
0:24:24,320 --> 0:24:28,320
about vitamin D for hospitalized patients, but I didn't mention the Spanish study

241
0:24:29,600 --> 0:24:34,880
effect of calcifidiol therapy and best available therapy versus best available

242
0:24:34,880 --> 0:24:39,920
therapy on intensive care unit admission and mortality among patients hospitalized with COVID-19,

243
0:24:39,920 --> 0:24:47,600
a pilot randomized study. I will say, this pilot study did show benefit. There was

244
0:24:47,600 --> 0:24:54,000
an RCT at a Brazil that failed to show benefit. I'll say, there are studies going forward,

245
0:24:54,000 --> 0:24:59,680
including the UK-based coronavite trial. I like the name on that, which is actually fully

246
0:24:59,680 --> 0:25:05,520
enrolled and we'll get data on that unless the pandemic abruptly ends, which it's not doing in

247
0:25:05,520 --> 0:25:11,760
the UK. We're actually going to get data from that. We'll see. I want to be balanced here.

248
0:25:11,760 --> 0:25:16,960
One study that says it works. One study that shows it doesn't show effect. I'll be honest

249
0:25:16,960 --> 0:25:22,320
when I say, as we learn, I'm happy to share that. I'm not weighing on on either side. If a

250
0:25:22,320 --> 0:25:26,960
patient comes in and their vitamin D deficient and you give them vitamin D, that actually seems

251
0:25:26,960 --> 0:25:31,040
like it makes a little bit of sense. Is it going to really make a difference? I don't think so.

252
0:25:31,040 --> 0:25:35,040
I don't know. Maybe it will. I'm just going to basically say, I don't know.

253
0:25:36,400 --> 0:25:43,520
Again, really limit the use of antibiotics because only about 10% of patients have actual

254
0:25:43,520 --> 0:25:49,440
bacterial co-infections in the initial presentation. But we go right into the

255
0:25:49,440 --> 0:25:55,040
secondary infection phase. You get to week two and three. That's when we actually see

256
0:25:55,040 --> 0:25:59,440
patients start to not do well. They start to require more oxygen. They start to have a change

257
0:25:59,440 --> 0:26:04,800
in mental status. Maybe the white count goes up. This is when we want to look for not only bacterial

258
0:26:05,440 --> 0:26:11,040
but fungal infections. We're seeing both. Then this leads right into that multi-inflammatory

259
0:26:11,040 --> 0:26:18,160
system phase where we see a lot of our clotting issues and we see a number of our other issues.

260
0:26:19,440 --> 0:26:24,480
There's really no clear division here, but we run into this tail phase and the issue of

261
0:26:24,480 --> 0:26:28,640
can patients make it out of the hospital. If they are going to make it out of the hospital,

262
0:26:28,640 --> 0:26:34,320
there's a couple of things I want to say. One is at discharge. We are recommending,

263
0:26:34,320 --> 0:26:42,640
particularly in our higher risk patients, extended prophylaxis against clots for at least 30 days,

264
0:26:42,640 --> 0:26:46,640
but then we customize this based upon bleeding risk and risk of clotting.

265
0:26:47,600 --> 0:26:51,680
Some cases, we're still low molecular weight heparin. We're actually continuing that post

266
0:26:51,680 --> 0:26:56,800
discharge, particularly our highest risk patients that may be going to skilled nursing facilities.

267
0:26:57,600 --> 0:27:03,680
A lot of our next level of risk, we're doing the direct acting oral anticoagulants that

268
0:27:03,680 --> 0:27:10,400
doe acts. There's a relto, the eliquis. As we get to a lower risk, it might just be an aspirin

269
0:27:10,400 --> 0:27:16,400
once a day. How did these people do? I always come back to the like, we don't want to clap

270
0:27:16,400 --> 0:27:22,560
these people out and forget them. There was a nice article characterizing long COVID in an

271
0:27:22,560 --> 0:27:29,360
international cohort, seven months of symptoms and their impact. I was posted on the MedRx

272
0:27:29,360 --> 0:27:36,240
server, looked at about 4,000 individuals, 50 countries. Only about 8% required hospitalization,

273
0:27:36,240 --> 0:27:41,920
right? So 90% were outpatient. This is an idea that the outpatients are just fine,

274
0:27:41,920 --> 0:27:46,880
but I'm going to say this study did not suggest that and I will not suggest that. That's not

275
0:27:46,880 --> 0:27:52,320
been my experience. The majority of the people here, these are people who are past 28 days and

276
0:27:52,320 --> 0:27:57,920
still have symptoms. The majority, we're still reporting severe fatigue and cognitive impacts

277
0:27:57,920 --> 0:28:04,560
greater than six months post diagnosis. This was looking at a survey open to individuals 18 years

278
0:28:04,560 --> 0:28:10,960
of age and older who experienced symptoms consistent with COVID-19 in order to be able to characterize

279
0:28:10,960 --> 0:28:16,160
the long COVID symptoms over extended duration. They looked at people and they said, have you had

280
0:28:16,160 --> 0:28:21,200
symptoms more than 28 days and that's who they were looking at. And the people had to have

281
0:28:21,200 --> 0:28:26,880
the symptom onset back in December and May. So I'm going to critical question for me,

282
0:28:26,880 --> 0:28:31,520
is what percent of people who get COVID will go on to have long COVID?

283
0:28:32,400 --> 0:28:37,440
And there was a nice paper on this, attributes and predictors of long COVID, analysis of

284
0:28:38,000 --> 0:28:42,320
COVID cases and their symptoms collected by the COVID symptoms study app,

285
0:28:43,440 --> 0:28:49,600
also posted, and really suggesting about 13% of people will have symptoms that last beyond that

286
0:28:49,600 --> 0:28:54,240
four weeks that fall into the group that was studied above. So we know a certain percent of

287
0:28:54,240 --> 0:28:59,040
people end up in the hospital. We know a certain percent of people that die, in our case,

288
0:28:59,040 --> 0:29:05,280
fatality rate is about 3% right now. But our case morbidity rate, here it's suggesting that

289
0:29:05,920 --> 0:29:11,840
about 13% of people are continuing to have symptoms past that four weeks. And as we saw,

290
0:29:12,400 --> 0:29:17,200
if you look at those individuals out at six months, the majority of them are having cognitive,

291
0:29:17,200 --> 0:29:23,040
they're having fatigue issues. So just to close on this here, in the US right now,

292
0:29:23,040 --> 0:29:30,560
about 12 million cases, we have an outcome for 12 million cases with 3% mortality,

293
0:29:30,560 --> 0:29:35,840
worldwide 60 million cases. Again, about 2 million deaths, these are where we actually have an

294
0:29:35,840 --> 0:29:42,000
outcome. The case fatality rate in the world is about 3%. So that's pretty significant.

295
0:29:42,000 --> 0:29:48,320
And the morbidity, we know that a lot of people that don't die continue to suffer. So I always

296
0:29:48,320 --> 0:29:53,680
want to keep pointing that out. These people, we need to understand, we need to learn better.

297
0:29:53,680 --> 0:29:58,960
We're treating it sort of symptomatically, not really having anything fantastic to offer. So

298
0:29:58,960 --> 0:30:04,960
we need to learn, we need to help these folks. And I will say thank you for everyone that continues

299
0:30:04,960 --> 0:30:10,640
to listen. Unfortunately, this is still going to be going on for a while. We're still doing our

300
0:30:10,640 --> 0:30:15,520
fundraising, try to keep the message out, and also continuing to help support the Peace Corps

301
0:30:15,520 --> 0:30:21,040
with their HIV and AIDS program. So when you get a moment, go to parasiteswithoutboarders.com

302
0:30:21,040 --> 0:30:26,480
and help us continue our work. All right, our first question is from Christine,

303
0:30:26,480 --> 0:30:34,400
who wants to know about the high risk groups for vaccination. Dr. Griffin read off a list,

304
0:30:34,400 --> 0:30:40,480
less 698, that is derived presumably from a CDC document. However, the document actually

305
0:30:40,480 --> 0:30:45,040
divides that risk people into two groups. Those who definitely are at risk, those who might be

306
0:30:45,040 --> 0:30:50,800
at increased risk, the footnote on the CDC page only references the definitely are at risk group.

307
0:30:50,800 --> 0:30:55,600
So that does that mean everyone else in the might be increased risk is essentially delegated

308
0:30:55,600 --> 0:31:01,520
to the back of the line in phase two, asking on behalf of my friends with severe asthma,

309
0:31:01,520 --> 0:31:07,120
my friends with type 1 diabetes, my friends with autoimmune diseases or MS taking immunosuppressants

310
0:31:07,120 --> 0:31:11,840
and myself, a healthcare worker who has been on medical leave for several months and not getting

311
0:31:11,840 --> 0:31:17,120
vaccinated with my colleagues, and will likely be resigning until I can better manage my condition

312
0:31:17,120 --> 0:31:23,600
of POTS, a form of disodenomia, rather than a cardiac condition. So I'm assuming I might

313
0:31:23,600 --> 0:31:29,040
only fall into an increased risk category because of my chronic flu drug cortisone use rather than

314
0:31:29,040 --> 0:31:35,040
the cardiac medication. I also take to manage my POTS. Any light you can shed on that.

315
0:31:35,680 --> 0:31:41,360
Yeah, you know, I have to say, let's be honest, the whole rollout of the vaccines is a bit of a

316
0:31:41,360 --> 0:31:46,800
disaster. And I think this is where this gets like when when will different groups get access to

317
0:31:46,800 --> 0:31:51,600
vaccine? You know, when we look across the country, there was a goal that by the end of this month,

318
0:31:51,600 --> 0:31:56,560
there would be 20 million people vaccinated and maybe it's one or two. So you're saying,

319
0:31:56,560 --> 0:32:00,960
my gosh, look at all these vaccines. And you know, and who's to blame, right? I mean, I think a lot

320
0:32:00,960 --> 0:32:06,480
of people have been asking that. The vaccines have been delivered to the states. The vaccines

321
0:32:06,480 --> 0:32:10,960
are sitting in fridges and freezers until those vaccines end up in arms. They're not doing

322
0:32:10,960 --> 0:32:18,960
anyone any benefit. And sort of more directly your question, the hierarchy of who gets it when

323
0:32:18,960 --> 0:32:23,040
keeps changing, right? So initially it was going to be the one a prime, we're going to do all the

324
0:32:23,040 --> 0:32:27,760
ER the ICU, then we're going to get long term care facility and the rest of the health care

325
0:32:27,760 --> 0:32:31,440
providers. And now a number of the states have just broken ranks and said, you know what,

326
0:32:31,440 --> 0:32:36,960
we're just doing everyone over a certain age. And it seems like a number of other states are

327
0:32:36,960 --> 0:32:43,120
falling into line. So it is really interesting. I was walking the dogs with my wife, and we're

328
0:32:43,120 --> 0:32:49,120
talking about there's been all this focus on the ethics of equity. You know, there's 20% of the

329
0:32:49,120 --> 0:32:55,040
vaccines that are being given and 80% sitting in freezers and fridges. The emphasis, all the

330
0:32:55,040 --> 0:33:00,960
effort and the energy I think right now has to go to getting people vaccinated so that the line

331
0:33:00,960 --> 0:33:06,640
moves. You know, it doesn't matter if you're, you know, 10th in line and the line is like moving one

332
0:33:06,640 --> 0:33:12,160
person per hour. I'd rather be 100th in line at a move at a line that's moving, you know, 100 people

333
0:33:12,160 --> 0:33:18,800
every 12 minutes. So I really have to say, this will be changing, right, that the CDC guidance on

334
0:33:18,800 --> 0:33:24,400
who's at risk, who's at might be at increased risk and who gets vaccinated when and what the

335
0:33:24,400 --> 0:33:28,640
states are doing. And here in the US, the state governors are the ones that are making the ultimate

336
0:33:28,640 --> 0:33:34,160
decisions on who gets vaccinated when these things are going to keep changing. We hear in New York,

337
0:33:34,160 --> 0:33:39,360
it may change again. Pretty soon everyone will be in phase one and it really will hopefully be a

338
0:33:39,360 --> 0:33:44,080
question of just churning people through getting everyone vaccinated because there's lots and lots

339
0:33:44,080 --> 0:33:49,040
of doses out there. I think a big challenge is getting them in people's arms. So everyone can

340
0:33:49,040 --> 0:33:55,040
have access to the vaccines as soon as possible. Sarah and Tallahassee wants to know, is it safe

341
0:33:55,040 --> 0:34:00,560
to vaccinate patients with long COVID long haulers or whatever they are calling us unfortunate souls

342
0:34:00,560 --> 0:34:07,920
these days? Sarah, that's a great question. And in some sort of insight, because I've been watching

343
0:34:07,920 --> 0:34:12,160
this for a while, because I have a lot of long COVID patients go ahead and use that terminology

344
0:34:12,160 --> 0:34:18,400
for the moment keeps changing too. And you know, how have they done with other vaccines? So some

345
0:34:18,400 --> 0:34:25,280
of them got another vaccines over the last say 10 months now. And done fine. I did have one patient

346
0:34:25,280 --> 0:34:29,040
that got tetanus shot. They said, gosh, I felt like sort of a relapse there for a while and then

347
0:34:29,040 --> 0:34:34,560
kind of moved forward. So, you know, I've been doing a lot of vaccinations recently. We just got

348
0:34:35,280 --> 0:34:42,160
the COVID vaccine supply for the pro health doctors on Tuesday. So immediately we ran out and

349
0:34:42,160 --> 0:34:47,200
basically by the end of the next day, 90% of those vaccines that had arrived were in people's arms.

350
0:34:47,200 --> 0:34:53,440
And and I did over 80 myself. And I would talk to people as I was doing this. And some of these

351
0:34:53,440 --> 0:35:00,240
individuals are are individuals that are long COVID or long haulers. And I basically would say,

352
0:35:00,240 --> 0:35:05,200
you got to let me know I want feedback. I want to hear like now we vaccinated over a million people.

353
0:35:05,200 --> 0:35:08,720
I want to start getting feedback from how did these individuals do they were they were not

354
0:35:08,720 --> 0:35:12,880
studied. This was not part of any of the data that was discussed under the EUA reviews.

355
0:35:12,880 --> 0:35:19,760
So, as I get this data, I'm very excited to to share this and let people know. But when they

356
0:35:19,760 --> 0:35:24,320
ask, they say, should I get vaccinated? I say, my gosh, look at how how you did with COVID the first

357
0:35:24,320 --> 0:35:30,000
time. Do you want to risk getting at a second time? And so I'm encouraging these individuals to get

358
0:35:30,000 --> 0:35:35,680
vaccinated. And we'll see what what the impact is. But at least, you know, so far, right, we've

359
0:35:35,680 --> 0:35:40,480
been doing a lot of health care providers here in the state so far haven't gotten any negative

360
0:35:40,480 --> 0:35:44,800
feedback from the long haulers. But boy, if there there's issues, I want to hear. So let me know.

361
0:35:46,480 --> 0:35:53,040
Our last letter for 2020 is from Sue Ellen, who Daniel may remember from

362
0:35:53,040 --> 0:35:58,880
Twipp, Sue Ellen from Roswell, Georgia. I was talking to some friends yesterday discussing COVID

363
0:35:58,880 --> 0:36:03,840
vaccines. One friend says she will not get it does not even get flu vaccine because she's immune

364
0:36:03,840 --> 0:36:08,960
compromised. She has some hereditary disorder that caused her to have her spleen removed.

365
0:36:08,960 --> 0:36:13,280
I have at least two other friends I know who are missing their spleens. Well, whether they

366
0:36:13,280 --> 0:36:18,000
miss them or not, I can't say, but they have had them removed. My question is, what is the impact

367
0:36:18,000 --> 0:36:23,280
of having no spleen with regard to both COVID and the vaccine? Sounds like one of those prisoners

368
0:36:23,280 --> 0:36:28,000
dilemma type logic problems. If you don't have a spleen, I would think you're immune compromised,

369
0:36:28,000 --> 0:36:32,080
which should make you more liable to get severe COVID. So that should mean you should get the

370
0:36:32,080 --> 0:36:36,480
vaccine. But according to my French, you can't even get the flu vaccine because of her immune

371
0:36:36,480 --> 0:36:41,120
compromised status. So she figures that COVID vaccine is not for her either. You must have

372
0:36:41,120 --> 0:36:45,440
patients who have had their spleen's removed. So what is your recommendation with regard to the

373
0:36:45,440 --> 0:36:52,800
vaccine? Yeah, this I have to say this is a very interesting email and the whole issue about not

374
0:36:52,800 --> 0:36:58,640
having a spleen. I have to say we consider these individuals who have spleen to be at higher risk

375
0:36:58,640 --> 0:37:05,680
of bad outcomes with infections, particularly with pathogens that it's a polysaccharide type

376
0:37:05,680 --> 0:37:12,080
response. So we worry about encapsulated organisms. So we're about homophilus, influenza, pneumococcus,

377
0:37:12,080 --> 0:37:18,560
and such. So actually, we usually are sticklers, I would say, for getting these individuals vaccinated.

378
0:37:18,560 --> 0:37:23,040
So I'm not sure why she would be under the impression not. So I'm going to say,

379
0:37:23,840 --> 0:37:31,280
if you have no spleen, there is a site, there's a CDC, a splenia vaccine site where it basically

380
0:37:31,280 --> 0:37:36,880
goes through and it gives you a list of a dozen vaccines that are really critical. There's even

381
0:37:36,880 --> 0:37:43,440
a American Society of Hematology statement position on what to do with the mRNA vaccines,

382
0:37:43,440 --> 0:37:50,960
if you have no spleen, and we encourage and they encourage people without a spleen to get the mRNA

383
0:37:50,960 --> 0:37:56,560
vaccine. There's some concern that maybe you will not have as robust a response, but it's only

384
0:37:56,560 --> 0:38:01,760
theoretical. There's no downside. The only concern is maybe you will respond as well. But let's

385
0:38:01,760 --> 0:38:06,080
think about what's the issue with the spleen. The spleen is an area where you can have a lot

386
0:38:06,080 --> 0:38:09,920
of germanol centers, a lot of maturation of B cells, make a lot of really good antibodies.

387
0:38:10,800 --> 0:38:15,360
There are germanol centers in other places. So I'm going to say that I would recommend

388
0:38:15,920 --> 0:38:21,440
Sue Allen. Nice to get your remember you well from Twib. But I would recommend actually going

389
0:38:21,440 --> 0:38:25,840
ahead and getting that vaccine. I would say this is an individual who is at more at risk and

390
0:38:25,840 --> 0:38:32,800
would potentially get benefit. Well, that is our COVID-19 clinical update number 43 with Dr.

391
0:38:32,800 --> 0:38:39,040
Daniel Griffin. Daniel, it has been a privilege to have you join Twib this past year. Thanks so

392
0:38:39,040 --> 0:38:44,960
much and happy new year. Oh, thank you as well. It's been great. I love the opportunity to share

393
0:38:44,960 --> 0:38:51,280
this information. I hope everyone else enjoys it. And look forward to more updates next year.

394
0:38:51,280 --> 0:38:56,000
And I'll just I'll close on a little bit of good news. I just found out today that now with the

395
0:38:56,000 --> 0:39:01,840
excitement of CT values, I can get CT values on Long Island as well as at Columbia. So

396
0:39:01,840 --> 0:39:23,200
hopefully I'll have some clinical experience to share with everyone in the future.
