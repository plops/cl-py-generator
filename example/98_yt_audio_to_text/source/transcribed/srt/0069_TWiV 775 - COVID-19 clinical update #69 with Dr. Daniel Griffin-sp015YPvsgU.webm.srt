0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:06,880
This week in virology, the podcast about viruses, the kind that make you sick.

2
0:00:10,080 --> 0:00:20,640
From MicrobeTV, this is Twiv, this week in virology, Episode 775, recorded on July 1st, 2021.

3
0:00:21,200 --> 0:00:26,960
I'm Vincent Racken Yello, and you're listening to the podcast all about viruses. Joining me

4
0:00:26,960 --> 0:00:34,720
today from New York, Daniel Griffin. Hello, everyone. So Daniel, President Biden said,

5
0:00:34,720 --> 0:00:41,040
by July 4th, we'd have 70% of the US immunized. Has that been achieved?

6
0:00:41,680 --> 0:00:48,560
No, we're not quite there. We're falling a little short. And it's regional. We're falling short

7
0:00:48,560 --> 0:00:54,000
in different regions and kind of look at a map. And you can see where those regions are. And you

8
0:00:54,000 --> 0:01:02,240
really just look at the incidence of COVID-19. And you know those areas with low vaccination uptake.

9
0:01:03,200 --> 0:01:09,040
So yeah, we didn't quite hit there. I mean, we're doing, we're doing decent. You know, could be worse.

10
0:01:10,480 --> 0:01:14,320
So you worse could be better, right? It could definitely be better. I'm sorry that it's not

11
0:01:14,320 --> 0:01:22,320
better. Yeah, I mean, I, I had a woman I saw just yesterday, you know, Haitian to sad,

12
0:01:22,320 --> 0:01:29,120
had moved to the United States when she was younger. And she ended up in the ER. And I was

13
0:01:29,120 --> 0:01:33,520
talking to her a little bit about why she had not gotten vaccinated. And you know, there's a lot

14
0:01:33,520 --> 0:01:40,640
of this misinformation. She had been told that there was bad stuff in the vaccines. And in in

15
0:01:40,640 --> 0:01:47,360
15 years, we would all be dead. So it's hard to fight against that because apparently we have to

16
0:01:47,360 --> 0:01:54,000
wait 15 years to see. But no, I mean, you know, here's a woman who's sick. And I think we talked

17
0:01:54,000 --> 0:02:01,840
about my partner's sister-in-law who died leaving behind children. Yeah, I mean, they're, unfortunately,

18
0:02:01,840 --> 0:02:08,960
this misinformation is not innocent. It, it results in people getting sick, people dying. So so a lot

19
0:02:08,960 --> 0:02:13,680
has happened this week. I have to say, so Vincent and I, and to our listeners, I, you know, right

20
0:02:13,680 --> 0:02:19,200
after I record one episode, I start taking notes for the next one. I see an interesting article that

21
0:02:19,200 --> 0:02:23,920
came out. Sometimes I get to the end of the article and I realize I don't like that, delete that.

22
0:02:23,920 --> 0:02:29,840
Something more interesting comes up. And I keep thinking, boy, eventually like the firehose of

23
0:02:29,840 --> 0:02:35,600
information will settle down and we'll go to this month in clinical updates, but there just seems

24
0:02:35,600 --> 0:02:43,840
there's so much information. So let's jump right into it. My quotation, courage is not the absence

25
0:02:43,840 --> 0:02:50,240
of fear, but rather the assessment that something else is more important than fear. And actually,

26
0:02:50,240 --> 0:02:57,680
Peter Hotez tweeted that out. That's FDR. And I think he tweeted it out. You know, my sort of

27
0:02:57,680 --> 0:03:04,640
heart and sympathy goes down to so many science educators, like yourself, Vincent, like Peter,

28
0:03:04,640 --> 0:03:12,480
who are just trying to to spread knowledge to educate. And there's really a bit of a backlash,

29
0:03:12,480 --> 0:03:19,280
which is more than vile at times. So I know this is really tough. So I applaud the courage of all

30
0:03:19,280 --> 0:03:27,200
the people that continue to to educate despite that backlash. I will say before I get into my

31
0:03:27,200 --> 0:03:35,280
episode, I really love the tweet of episode 773 with Lori Garrett. Certainly no shrinking

32
0:03:35,280 --> 0:03:41,600
violet brought lots of passion. I love her books. So, you know, it's summertime, right? People go

33
0:03:41,600 --> 0:03:46,880
to the beach. They read books. They go to the lake. They have some time sitting on the back porch.

34
0:03:47,600 --> 0:03:51,840
These, these are great, great books and very, very timely while written.

35
0:03:51,840 --> 0:03:59,280
All right. So let me start. And I'm actually going to touch on a few controversial topics.

36
0:04:00,080 --> 0:04:06,480
This week, there was a guest essay. Human behavior during the pandemic is more important than any

37
0:04:06,480 --> 0:04:13,040
COVID variant. And I don't know if people ran across this, but this was written by a Dr.

38
0:04:13,040 --> 0:04:20,400
Rosenfeld and a Dr. Rachin Yellow. Yes. Same Amy and Vincent that our listeners might know.

39
0:04:20,400 --> 0:04:27,040
And the article really does an excellent job of making the point that I'll be touching on today.

40
0:04:28,000 --> 0:04:33,920
So ultimately, a virus has a genetic sequence that changes. And these changes can, they can be

41
0:04:33,920 --> 0:04:41,600
neutral. They can be favorable. They're usually unfavorable in terms of viral fitness. And this

42
0:04:41,600 --> 0:04:48,960
is my sort of request to the audience and the media to start using the word fitness, rather than

43
0:04:48,960 --> 0:04:56,640
transmissibility. And this viral fitness is really the same Darwinian concept that underlies the

44
0:04:56,640 --> 0:05:01,200
whole survival of the fittest that many of us learned about if we were allowed to be taught

45
0:05:01,200 --> 0:05:08,960
that in our schools. And reproduction is a chance for an organism to end up with improved fitness.

46
0:05:08,960 --> 0:05:15,120
And we have certainly given SARS-CoV-2 the opportunity to reproduce. And it's not surprising

47
0:05:15,120 --> 0:05:21,840
that we are seeing that the delta variant, that there's evidence to suggest that it has

48
0:05:21,840 --> 0:05:26,320
improved fitness, that it's going to have the ability to out-compete other viruses.

49
0:05:27,200 --> 0:05:32,880
And I know I drive some of even the other ID docs a little bit crazy in, you know, sort of focus

50
0:05:32,880 --> 0:05:39,200
on, let's say, things that are true. Let's use the right terminology. But I'm going to push on

51
0:05:39,200 --> 0:05:44,400
that and let's just spend a little time here before I get into other sort of bits in the literature.

52
0:05:44,400 --> 0:05:49,840
But take some time and read that article. Vincent hopefully will post it up on the

53
0:05:49,840 --> 0:05:55,440
Parasites Without Borders website. But let's sort of go through this together. What factors can

54
0:05:55,440 --> 0:06:02,800
improve a virus's or a variance fitness? What changes would be favorable? And I'm going to try

55
0:06:02,800 --> 0:06:08,480
to avoid anthropomorphism. And I think I'm going to succeed. So everyone can listen and comment

56
0:06:08,480 --> 0:06:16,560
if they catch me. But a virus can change in a way that increases the duration of viral shedding,

57
0:06:16,560 --> 0:06:21,680
right? So a person could perhaps shed virus for a longer period of time before they became

58
0:06:22,240 --> 0:06:28,560
symptomatic or before they become symptomatic. Maybe they can continue to shed viable infectious

59
0:06:28,560 --> 0:06:34,800
virus for a longer period post symptom onset. And this might involve some changes that impact

60
0:06:34,800 --> 0:06:40,800
the interaction with the immune system. A virus can mutate in a way that increases the level

61
0:06:41,360 --> 0:06:47,760
of this infectious virus shedding. A person could perhaps shed virus at a higher level, right? And

62
0:06:47,760 --> 0:06:53,040
we've talked about CT values. Even more than that, we've talked about how you don't just need a lot

63
0:06:53,040 --> 0:06:59,600
of RNA, but you actually need viable virus. So a little harder to look at that. A virus could change

64
0:06:59,600 --> 0:07:06,160
in a way that allows for infection of the next host with a lower inoculum, right? And people have

65
0:07:06,160 --> 0:07:12,720
talked about maybe improved affinity to the receptor. So lower inoculum resulting in infection.

66
0:07:13,680 --> 0:07:19,360
A virus can change in a way that modifies its tropism for lower down in the airways,

67
0:07:19,360 --> 0:07:23,360
potentially increasing the degree to which it's contained in smaller droplets that's been

68
0:07:23,360 --> 0:07:29,360
discussed on a prior Twiv. Or maybe it can modify its tropism to start involving more of the

69
0:07:29,360 --> 0:07:36,720
upper airways. More runny, drippy noses, maybe more sneezing. A virus can change in a way.

70
0:07:37,600 --> 0:07:43,520
And I'm going to sort of focus on this, where it can allow it to re-infect previously infected

71
0:07:43,520 --> 0:07:48,960
people. People that thought they had natural protection, maybe had natural protection against

72
0:07:48,960 --> 0:07:55,760
one of the early variants. But perhaps now changes. Maybe that sweet spot in the receptor

73
0:07:55,760 --> 0:08:01,520
body domain changes enough that those natural antibodies no longer target as well. Maybe the

74
0:08:01,520 --> 0:08:08,640
T cells aren't up to the challenge. Or a virus might change in a certain way that decreases its

75
0:08:08,640 --> 0:08:18,160
susceptibility to antiviral medications or vaccination. So I think that these are all reasonable.

76
0:08:19,600 --> 0:08:24,800
And I think that I'm going to sort of keep asking people. And I think it's for the media,

77
0:08:24,800 --> 0:08:31,520
right? The virus is becoming more fit. We have a fitness increase in the variants.

78
0:08:31,520 --> 0:08:34,800
I think that's exciting. People can read that, I think.

79
0:08:36,400 --> 0:08:41,520
Now, we do have concerns with the Delta variant that in addition to re-infecting the previously

80
0:08:41,520 --> 0:08:46,160
infected, there's evidence, such as the report from Scotland that I discussed last time,

81
0:08:46,800 --> 0:08:51,280
that the Delta variant may be associated with an increased risk of hospitalization,

82
0:08:51,280 --> 0:08:58,240
death, and seems to be infecting younger individuals. So let's just go through a few of these. But

83
0:08:58,240 --> 0:09:05,840
what I'm going to do is jump to the escape from vaccines and therapeutics. Let's get some science

84
0:09:05,840 --> 0:09:11,760
here. So I'm just not another person with two thumbs and an opinion. So we got new information

85
0:09:11,760 --> 0:09:18,480
from Moderna in the form of the press release. Moderna provides a clinical update on the neutralizing

86
0:09:18,480 --> 0:09:25,760
activity of its COVID-19 vaccine on emerging variants, including the Delta variant first identified in

87
0:09:25,760 --> 0:09:30,800
India. But they also released the data as a preprint. So let's jump to the preprint,

88
0:09:30,800 --> 0:09:39,520
right to the preprint serum neutralizing activity of mRNA 1273 against SARS-CoV-2 variants, right?

89
0:09:39,520 --> 0:09:46,480
So this is the Moderna vaccine. The authors reported that Sira from participants immunized

90
0:09:46,480 --> 0:09:51,360
on a prime boost schedule, right? So first shot, then you four weeks later with Moderna get the

91
0:09:51,360 --> 0:10:00,800
second shot, had neutralizing activity against several SARS-CoV-2 variants, including variants of

92
0:10:00,800 --> 0:10:11,280
concern and variants of interest. And this was compared to the D614G. So the wild type SARS-CoV-2

93
0:10:11,280 --> 0:10:17,280
as a referent. They showed that there were minimal effects on neutralization against, and I'm going

94
0:10:17,280 --> 0:10:22,960
to, we're going to go with the Greek here against the alpha variant, only a 1.2-fold reduction.

95
0:10:23,600 --> 0:10:32,560
The other VOCs, they looked at beta, gamma, delta, and you saw between a 2.1 and an 8-4-fold

96
0:10:32,560 --> 0:10:39,120
reduction. So what they were describing as small reduction, but little detail here.

97
0:10:39,120 --> 0:10:46,400
The participants were immunized. The Sira was collected seven days post-boost. They only

98
0:10:46,400 --> 0:10:52,000
analyzed eight participants. And these assays were done using pseudovirus,

99
0:10:52,720 --> 0:10:57,600
not real stuff in a BSL-3. So just to put that in context.

100
0:10:59,280 --> 0:11:05,280
What about other vaccines, comparison? We have data from the UK suggesting that the Pfizer

101
0:11:05,280 --> 0:11:11,760
BioNTech vaccine was 88% effective against symptomatic disease from the delta variant

102
0:11:11,760 --> 0:11:17,120
two weeks after the second dose, compared to 93% effective against the alpha variant.

103
0:11:18,000 --> 0:11:23,600
Two doses of the AstraZeneca, not as impressive, 60% effective against symptomatic disease

104
0:11:24,240 --> 0:11:30,400
from the delta variant compared to 66% compared to the alpha variant.

105
0:11:30,400 --> 0:11:37,840
Both vaccines. I think people may know this. We're only about 33% effective after just one dose,

106
0:11:38,560 --> 0:11:45,840
which is where many of us peg natural infection. The J&J efficacy is largely unknown. So I know

107
0:11:45,840 --> 0:11:51,040
I get a lot of questions here. Like now that we have the delta variant, what's the role of J&J?

108
0:11:52,320 --> 0:11:58,000
I have to say here in the US, we're very fortunate. The vast majority of our vaccination campaign

109
0:11:58,000 --> 0:12:06,080
has utilized the mRNA, the Moderna, and the Pfizer vaccines. And we're seeing the real world data

110
0:12:06,080 --> 0:12:10,320
from Pfizer BioNTech. Now we're getting a little more data on Moderna as well.

111
0:12:12,080 --> 0:12:15,440
All right, children, COVID, and mental health. I'm going to lump it all in there.

112
0:12:16,320 --> 0:12:22,480
As I like to say, children at low risk, but they are not at no risk. I had a great conversation.

113
0:12:22,480 --> 0:12:29,200
It was actually yesterday with Dr. Melissa Stockwell. She's one of the few experts in pediatric

114
0:12:29,200 --> 0:12:34,960
COVID. And she's right there, right here at Columbia University Medical Center.

115
0:12:35,760 --> 0:12:41,360
And it was really an interesting conversation we had. I've been working at the United Health

116
0:12:41,360 --> 0:12:47,440
Group level to try to identify referral centers for individuals with difficulty. And one of the

117
0:12:47,440 --> 0:12:53,200
biggest challenges is finding centers that have experience and a focus on children.

118
0:12:53,840 --> 0:13:00,880
So we were discussing a bit of her experience with regarding long COVID in children. And her

119
0:13:00,880 --> 0:13:06,080
suggestion was that we may have underestimated how much long COVID is impacting children.

120
0:13:06,800 --> 0:13:13,040
And she says she's starting to see in the recent few weeks here, as the children leave school,

121
0:13:13,040 --> 0:13:18,720
try to get out there and exercise and get involved in activities. A lot more parents are noticing

122
0:13:18,720 --> 0:13:25,520
that their children are struggling. We had a little conversation, how much of that is post-acute

123
0:13:25,520 --> 0:13:35,360
sequelae of COVID versus post-acute sequelae of a pandemic. So there'll be more on this as we go

124
0:13:35,360 --> 0:13:40,640
forward. But just to keep this in mind, a lot of these younger individuals still do not have the

125
0:13:40,640 --> 0:13:45,920
opportunity to get vaccinated and certain parts of our country still have actually

126
0:13:46,720 --> 0:13:53,600
unacceptably high infection rates. As I mentioned, mental health, the pandemic has had a significant

127
0:13:53,600 --> 0:14:01,200
impact on mental health. I discussed the issue in adolescent girls, actually, a significant

128
0:14:01,200 --> 0:14:09,040
increase in them ending up in the emergency room. But we had an MMR early release from the CDC,

129
0:14:09,040 --> 0:14:16,800
symptoms of depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, and suicidal ideation among

130
0:14:16,800 --> 0:14:22,720
state, tribal, local, and territorial public health workers during the COVID-19 pandemic,

131
0:14:22,720 --> 0:14:32,320
the United States marched through April of 2021. Now, the authors reported they looked at 26,174

132
0:14:32,320 --> 0:14:39,120
public health workers, 53 percent reported symptoms at least one mental health condition

133
0:14:39,680 --> 0:14:45,680
in the two weeks prior to the survey. Symptoms were most prevalent among those who were unable to

134
0:14:45,680 --> 0:14:53,200
take time off or who were working greater than or equal to 41 hours per week. So the majority of

135
0:14:53,200 --> 0:14:59,280
public health workers surveyed were reporting mental health issues. The reported symptoms of

136
0:14:59,280 --> 0:15:10,080
depression, 32 percent, anxiety, 30 percent, PTSD, 37 percent, suicidal ideation was as high as 8.4 percent.

137
0:15:11,120 --> 0:15:17,600
The highest prevalence of a mental health condition was among respondents aged less than or equal

138
0:15:17,600 --> 0:15:25,840
to 29 and among transgender and non-binary persons of all ages. The authors do comment

139
0:15:25,840 --> 0:15:32,640
that the findings of this report have certain limitations. I thought the most important that

140
0:15:32,640 --> 0:15:37,040
they mentioned was that the participants were surveyed only about symptoms experienced in the

141
0:15:37,040 --> 0:15:42,240
two weeks preceding the survey. So it doesn't reflect all the stress and all the difficulties

142
0:15:42,240 --> 0:15:48,880
over the last 18 months, sort of a snapshot here, but an incredibly troubling snapshot.

143
0:15:48,880 --> 0:15:56,320
And I think this reinforces what we're seeing all across the healthcare sector. We're seeing

144
0:15:56,320 --> 0:16:02,160
individuals struggling with mental health challenges due to stress, financial insecurity,

145
0:16:03,120 --> 0:16:09,120
loss. I mean, a lot of people have lost loved ones, jobs, other things. And I really appreciated

146
0:16:09,120 --> 0:16:15,120
a piece by my friend Lucy McBride published in The Atlantic. I need to subscribe. By now,

147
0:16:15,120 --> 0:16:20,080
burnout is a given. Just discussing how we're seeing this in so many healthcare providers,

148
0:16:20,080 --> 0:16:26,640
but we're no special class. We're seeing this all across our society. So mental health is health.

149
0:16:28,080 --> 0:16:33,520
All right. I would like to say testing never miss an opportunity to test. We still need to

150
0:16:33,520 --> 0:16:39,760
keep doing testing. And particularly with the suggestion that we may now see presentations

151
0:16:39,760 --> 0:16:46,240
that are less typical than we're used to at individual today who went to an urgent care center

152
0:16:46,240 --> 0:16:51,600
with a chief complaint of, I think I have sinusitis. I'm feeling all this fullness in my sinuses,

153
0:16:52,720 --> 0:17:00,000
tested positive for COVID ended up in the emergency room. We confirmed that that was COVID. This

154
0:17:00,000 --> 0:17:06,080
gentleman is now hypoxic in the hospital. And really the presentation was sinusitis,

155
0:17:06,080 --> 0:17:13,760
which quickly then evolved into hypoxemia and pulmonary involvement. All right, active vaccination

156
0:17:14,560 --> 0:17:19,280
never miss an opportunity to vaccinate. And vaccination is how this pandemic ends.

157
0:17:20,080 --> 0:17:26,720
Lots here this week. The article correlates of protection against symptomatic and asymptomatic

158
0:17:26,720 --> 0:17:33,440
SARS COVID-2 infection was posted as a preprint by a number of authors and the Oxford COVID

159
0:17:33,440 --> 0:17:41,920
vaccine trial group. So data from a randomized efficacy trial of the Chadox AstraZeneca vaccine

160
0:17:42,560 --> 0:17:47,840
in the UK were analyzed to determine the antibody levels associated with protection against SARS

161
0:17:47,840 --> 0:17:54,720
COVID-2. So drumroll here, we all want to know this. Can I get a blood test? Can I find out?

162
0:17:54,720 --> 0:18:01,120
Am I protected? So they looked at any spike in anti-receptor binding domain IgG

163
0:18:01,120 --> 0:18:07,440
by multiplex amino assay. They used pseudovirus and live neutralizing, like that used the word

164
0:18:07,440 --> 0:18:14,240
live in this virology paper. I should say active neutralizing antibody at 28 days after the second

165
0:18:14,240 --> 0:18:21,520
dose. And they looked at infected, non-infected vaccine recipients. And they reported that higher

166
0:18:21,520 --> 0:18:28,960
levels of all immune markers correlated with a reduced risk of symptomatic infection. But

167
0:18:28,960 --> 0:18:35,760
antibody responses did not correlate with overall protection against asymptomatic infection.

168
0:18:36,560 --> 0:18:43,360
So the authors reported that they had data for anti-spike and anti-receptor binding domain IgG

169
0:18:43,360 --> 0:18:55,440
from 1,318 individuals. They had 163 cases, 1,155 non-cases. Interesting, but still very

170
0:18:55,440 --> 0:19:01,360
preliminary. I'm not sure we have all the answers. This data is only for the AstraZeneca vaccine.

171
0:19:02,000 --> 0:19:08,640
It only looked at responses, any predominantly Caucasian population in the UK, when only the

172
0:19:08,640 --> 0:19:14,320
alpha variant was circulating. And as noted, no correlation was seen with higher levels of

173
0:19:14,320 --> 0:19:20,880
antibody and protection against asymptomatic infection. And we do know that we can get

174
0:19:20,880 --> 0:19:28,560
transmission with asymptomatic infection. Now people that unfortunately have to tolerate

175
0:19:28,560 --> 0:19:34,720
me in person on a regular basis have probably grown tired of. I always find a way to insert

176
0:19:34,720 --> 0:19:41,360
the word heterogenous into conversations, one of my favorite words. But now we now have a study

177
0:19:41,360 --> 0:19:49,920
published in the Lancet about heterogenous vaccinations, mix and max, max, mix and max. See,

178
0:19:49,920 --> 0:19:57,840
heterogenous, so much easier to say. Immunogenicity and reactogenicity of BNT162B2 booster

179
0:19:57,840 --> 0:20:04,880
in Chadox primed participants, CombiVacS, a multi-center open label randomized controlled

180
0:20:04,880 --> 0:20:13,200
phase two trial. So the authors reported on this randomized control trial on adults aged 18 to 60

181
0:20:13,200 --> 0:20:18,640
vaccinated with a single dose of the Chadox AstraZeneca vaccine, eight to 12 weeks before

182
0:20:18,640 --> 0:20:25,120
screening, no history of prior infection. And then the participants were randomly assigned to either

183
0:20:25,120 --> 0:20:33,440
get the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine via a single intramuscular injection, or just to continue

184
0:20:33,440 --> 0:20:40,080
observation, a control group. And the primary outcome was 14-day immunogenicity measured

185
0:20:40,080 --> 0:20:47,120
by immunoassays for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and receptor binding domain. So here again,

186
0:20:47,120 --> 0:20:51,920
we're measuring antibody levels, right? We just got a little bit of sense that maybe there's some

187
0:20:51,920 --> 0:21:00,160
correlation we might have there. So 676 individuals were enrolled, randomly assigned to either intervention

188
0:21:00,160 --> 0:21:06,560
at five university hospitals in Spain's was done in Spain. In the intervention group,

189
0:21:06,560 --> 0:21:18,880
the receptor binding domain antibodies increased from 7.46 up to 7,756. As far as the IgG against

190
0:21:18,880 --> 0:21:29,600
trimeric spike protein, this increased from 98.4 to 3,684.87. Reactions were mild to moderate

191
0:21:29,600 --> 0:21:38,480
some injection site pain, not infection, injection site pain, some induration. About 44% of the

192
0:21:38,480 --> 0:21:46,480
people said they developed a headache. About 43% felt the muscle aches, no serious adverse

193
0:21:46,480 --> 0:21:54,320
events. But basically, they were showing that we were seeing a significant rise in antibody levels

194
0:21:54,320 --> 0:22:00,880
using this mix and match or heterogeneous vaccine approach. And I know we get a lot of questions

195
0:22:00,880 --> 0:22:07,680
because in certain parts of the world, AstraZeneca was rolled out and then they pulled it back and

196
0:22:07,680 --> 0:22:14,480
then people are getting other vaccines. What I don't know if I can comment on here is this is

197
0:22:14,480 --> 0:22:19,280
just getting one dose of the mRNA vaccine. The current recommendation is still, let's say you

198
0:22:19,280 --> 0:22:25,600
come to the US and you've only had one AstraZeneca vaccine, we recommend just restarting and doing

199
0:22:25,600 --> 0:22:31,280
two shots of the mRNA. So this is the kind of data that might factor into those recommendations.

200
0:22:33,360 --> 0:22:42,400
All right, now if a person had COVID-19 previously, should they get one or two doses of a two dose

201
0:22:42,400 --> 0:22:50,080
vaccine? Certainly controversial. The report prior SARS-CoV-2 infection rescues B and T cell

202
0:22:50,080 --> 0:22:56,720
responses to variants after first vaccine dose was published in science. And we've been hearing a

203
0:22:56,720 --> 0:23:01,680
lot about this issue. And it may be helpful in many areas of the world that already have

204
0:23:01,680 --> 0:23:07,680
significant number of prior infections, more limited numbers of available vaccine doses

205
0:23:07,680 --> 0:23:13,920
to sort of know, can we take people who had COVID before and just give them one vaccine? Do we need

206
0:23:13,920 --> 0:23:20,400
to use two twice the resources? The authors analyzed T and B cell responses after first dose

207
0:23:20,400 --> 0:23:27,360
vaccination with the Pfizer, BioNTech mRNA vaccine in healthcare workers. They followed

208
0:23:27,360 --> 0:23:35,280
them longitudinally. These were people that had previous infection. After one dose, individuals

209
0:23:35,280 --> 0:23:41,520
with prior infection showed enhanced T cell immunity, antibodies secreting memory B cell response,

210
0:23:42,240 --> 0:23:50,240
and neutralizing antibodies against the variants. I think that all this is interesting. And to be

211
0:23:50,240 --> 0:23:56,480
honest, does build on what we know. This is actually, I'll say a rather dense, interesting paper,

212
0:23:57,040 --> 0:24:02,640
perhaps on immune or some immunologist will do a deeper dive into this. But I'm not sure this is

213
0:24:02,640 --> 0:24:09,120
so far or at the point where this is practice changing information, but we are learning more.

214
0:24:11,120 --> 0:24:16,480
This may also impact that WHO has forecast that certain vulnerable high risk individuals

215
0:24:16,480 --> 0:24:23,600
may need yearly COVID shots vaccines. There won't be COVID in the shots. There will be vaccine in

216
0:24:23,600 --> 0:24:28,720
those shots. You know, if richer countries feel they need boosters for some of their citizens,

217
0:24:28,720 --> 0:24:34,080
then this, again, will affect equity issue. I do want to remind all the listeners how effective

218
0:24:34,080 --> 0:24:39,360
these vaccines are, even in people with negative serology tests. I want people to everyone to run

219
0:24:39,360 --> 0:24:45,600
out and get those serology tests. In the last month, there have been more than 18,000 deaths

220
0:24:45,600 --> 0:24:51,200
from COVID here in the U.S. And over 99% of those were in unvaccinated individuals.

221
0:24:52,320 --> 0:24:56,720
All right. In the New England Journal of Medicine, we saw effect of vaccination

222
0:24:56,720 --> 0:25:02,960
on household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in England. And this is really, I think,

223
0:25:02,960 --> 0:25:07,520
addresses the critical issue. People come up all the time. If I've been vaccinated,

224
0:25:07,520 --> 0:25:15,680
can I transmit the virus to other people? This really is critical because the whole concept of

225
0:25:15,680 --> 0:25:22,880
community immunity relies on vaccines interrupting transmission. And this is that question,

226
0:25:22,880 --> 0:25:28,080
is there free lunch for the unvaccinated? So the authors analyzed data from the household

227
0:25:28,080 --> 0:25:34,480
transmission evaluation data set hosted, which is information on all laboratory confirmed cases

228
0:25:34,480 --> 0:25:41,360
of COVID-19 in England. As you can imagine, it's a very large data set. So between January 4th,

229
0:25:41,360 --> 0:25:51,760
February 28th, 2021, there were 960,765 household contacts of unvaccinated index patients,

230
0:25:51,760 --> 0:25:59,600
and there were 96,898 secondary cases of COVID-19. The authors compared the risk of secondary

231
0:25:59,600 --> 0:26:05,840
infection defined as a positive SARS-CoV-2 test two to 14 days after the positive test for the

232
0:26:05,840 --> 0:26:13,600
index case among unvaccinated household contexts of vaccinated persons with the risk among unvaccinated

233
0:26:13,600 --> 0:26:18,880
household contexts of unvaccinated persons with infection. And they reported, drumroll,

234
0:26:18,880 --> 0:26:25,600
that vaccination was associated with a 40 to 50% reduction in transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

235
0:26:26,400 --> 0:26:35,440
Now, there's a couple things I will say there. One is they are through their contact tracing,

236
0:26:35,440 --> 0:26:42,880
confirming that vaccinated people who get infected can still transmit it to other individuals.

237
0:26:42,880 --> 0:26:49,040
I was a little underwhelmed, I guess 40 to 50% reduction in transmission. I had hoped

238
0:26:49,040 --> 0:26:54,880
for better. That is not as much as I would like. But remember, this is only the second step in

239
0:26:54,880 --> 0:27:00,480
the process. The first step in the process is a vaccinated person has to get infected. And we

240
0:27:00,480 --> 0:27:07,040
already have, well, good information on symptomatic infection. We're getting better information as

241
0:27:07,040 --> 0:27:13,200
time goes by on the decrease impact of any asymptomatic infection. But just to keep in mind,

242
0:27:13,200 --> 0:27:20,080
a vaccinated person is not 100% safe. If they get infected with SARS-CoV-2, they are less likely,

243
0:27:20,080 --> 0:27:27,040
but not zero. All right. Now, the next question I get all the time, how long will my vaccine

244
0:27:27,040 --> 0:27:34,240
induced immunity protect me? Will I need a booster shot? And the article SARS-CoV-2,

245
0:27:34,240 --> 0:27:41,440
mRNA vaccines induce persistent human germinal center responses, was published in nature.

246
0:27:42,240 --> 0:27:49,200
And again, this is a rather deep, complex article. The flow cytometry for all the immunologists in

247
0:27:49,200 --> 0:27:54,400
the audience are very nice. I'm sure they had to do a lot of flow cytometry to get such nice

248
0:27:54,400 --> 0:28:00,960
flow plots. But what the researchers did here is they examined fine needle aspirates. Explain

249
0:28:00,960 --> 0:28:06,320
what that is. You take a small needle and you actually put it into a lymph node, and then you

250
0:28:06,320 --> 0:28:13,040
draw back on a syringe, you're actually obtaining cells. They did this from 14 individuals from the

251
0:28:13,040 --> 0:28:18,480
draining axillary lymph nodes. So you can think about you're getting your vaccine in your deltoid,

252
0:28:18,480 --> 0:28:23,680
in your arm, and then they're checking the lymph nodes under the arm, in the armpit.

253
0:28:23,680 --> 0:28:30,640
They identified germinal center B cells that bound S protein in all participants sampled

254
0:28:30,640 --> 0:28:37,440
after primary immunization. They reported that high frequency of S binding germinal center B

255
0:28:37,440 --> 0:28:44,080
cells and plasma blast were sustained in these draining lymph nodes for at least 12 weeks after

256
0:28:44,080 --> 0:28:50,480
the booster immunization. And they suggested that these findings supported the idea that SARS-CoV-2

257
0:28:50,480 --> 0:28:56,560
mRNA based vaccination of humans might induce a persistent germinal center B cell response,

258
0:28:56,560 --> 0:29:01,440
enabling the generation of robust umeral immunity that might be rather durable.

259
0:29:02,160 --> 0:29:08,000
So this is interesting. It's a cause for optimism. But we still need some more data to before we

260
0:29:08,000 --> 0:29:14,480
hang our hat on this. Now this, this was kind of a late one coming in, but I think exciting.

261
0:29:14,480 --> 0:29:23,440
Um, we saw the New England Journal medicine publication safety and efficacy of NVX COV-2373

262
0:29:23,440 --> 0:29:31,280
COVID-19 vaccine. Um, that's the Nova Vax, the protein based vaccine. The, as I've liked to say,

263
0:29:31,280 --> 0:29:36,720
the honest traditional vaccine that we've been using for many years for for shingles vaccination,

264
0:29:36,720 --> 0:29:43,120
shingrix, pertussis hepatitis B. And here in the New England Journal of Medicine, we saw the

265
0:29:43,120 --> 0:29:50,800
peer-reviewed publication of the Phase 3 randomized observer-blinded placebo control trial conducted

266
0:29:50,800 --> 0:30:00,080
at 33 sites in the UK. Um, individuals, adults ages 18 to 84 in a one-to-one ratio to receive

267
0:30:00,080 --> 0:30:09,680
two intramuscular immunizations or placebo administered 21 days apart. The primary efficacy

268
0:30:09,680 --> 0:30:16,960
endpoint was biologically confirmed mild, moderate or severe COV-2, SARS-CoV-2 infection,

269
0:30:16,960 --> 0:30:23,680
with an onset of at least seven days after that second injection, um, in participants who were

270
0:30:23,680 --> 0:30:28,080
serologically negative at baseline, right? So these are people that had not been infected,

271
0:30:28,080 --> 0:30:36,640
were immunized. Um, the two-dose, um, Nova Vax vaccine, um, conferred 89.7% protection,

272
0:30:36,640 --> 0:30:43,120
against SARS-CoV-2 infection, and, um, showed high efficacy against the alpha variant. Uh,

273
0:30:43,120 --> 0:30:48,880
the incidence of serious adverse events was low. And actually, I thought this was interesting. Um,

274
0:30:48,880 --> 0:30:53,520
it was very hard for individuals to be able to tell whether or not they were in the placebo

275
0:30:53,520 --> 0:30:59,200
or the vaccine group. So this has a lot less of that reactogenicity, um, that we've grown

276
0:30:59,200 --> 0:31:06,560
accustomed to. Um, we hear rumors that Nova Vax is going to be, um, putting this forward to the FDA,

277
0:31:06,560 --> 0:31:11,760
this quarter, sort of the corporate approach to the world. So this quarter will be, I guess,

278
0:31:11,760 --> 0:31:17,760
July, August, September. Um, so this will be an exciting, um, addition. Um, and, and I think it,

279
0:31:17,760 --> 0:31:22,480
it will make a difference. There's a lot of individuals that I talked to that are waiting

280
0:31:22,480 --> 0:31:27,440
for this vaccine. Um, so I think if we can give people options and that option then,

281
0:31:27,440 --> 0:31:33,440
um, ends up with them vaccinated. Um, I'm all for choices. The time, the period of detectable

282
0:31:33,440 --> 0:31:38,880
viral replication, right? That first week that viral symptom phase, the time for monitoring

283
0:31:38,880 --> 0:31:43,440
and monoclonals. And as I like to say, where you get your test is where you should be able to get

284
0:31:43,440 --> 0:31:50,880
your monoclonals. Um, U S health officials on Friday, February 25th, pause the distribution

285
0:31:50,880 --> 0:31:58,640
of Eli Lilly's COVID 1980 body cocktail therapy, um, with concerns about a lack of effectiveness

286
0:31:58,640 --> 0:32:05,600
against the beta and gamma corona variants. Um, the FDA recommended use of the Regeneron

287
0:32:05,600 --> 0:32:13,680
cocktail, um, and the, via GSK therapy instead of this combination therapy. Um, all of the

288
0:32:13,680 --> 0:32:19,680
assays to date would suggest that those other monoclonal therapies, um, continue to be effective.

289
0:32:19,680 --> 0:32:25,760
Um, just some sort of real world. Um, the government has purchased a lot of the Regeneron cocktails.

290
0:32:25,760 --> 0:32:30,160
They're sort of out there sitting on shelves. Um, I have not seen much uptake with the

291
0:32:30,160 --> 0:32:35,600
via GSK yet. Um, and I'm still waiting to find out will the government purchase that? Um,

292
0:32:35,600 --> 0:32:39,920
will that be something that health insurance companies are expected to reimburse? What are

293
0:32:39,920 --> 0:32:47,440
the on the ground issue differences? Um, Regeneron is frozen, must be thawed. Um, you can do IV,

294
0:32:47,440 --> 0:32:52,880
or as we now know, sub queue with four injections. Um, and then there's a two hour observation

295
0:32:52,880 --> 0:32:58,560
period. Uh, the via GSK can be in the fridge. Um, it can be a 30 minute infusion with a one

296
0:32:58,560 --> 0:33:03,840
hour wait time. So may have a certain role in that doctor's office that busy urgent care.

297
0:33:04,880 --> 0:33:10,240
And since a lot of people have decided, um, not to get vaccinated, uh, there will continue

298
0:33:10,240 --> 0:33:16,320
to be a first week of COVID. All right. Early inflammatory phase, right? These are those

299
0:33:16,320 --> 0:33:22,960
individuals. The oxygen saturation drops below 94%. Uh, they end up in the hospital. We have steroids.

300
0:33:22,960 --> 0:33:29,680
We have oxygen. We have remdesivir. Um, monoclonals, right? If they're anybody, um, is still negative,

301
0:33:29,680 --> 0:33:35,280
the data we talked about from, uh, the Regeneron cocktail. June 24th, the FDA announced that they

302
0:33:35,280 --> 0:33:42,480
had issued an emergency use authorization and EUA for the drug tosyllism app, uh, for the

303
0:33:42,480 --> 0:33:48,800
treatment of hospitalized adults and patients, um, who are receiving steroids, um, require

304
0:33:48,800 --> 0:33:55,920
supplemental oxygen, um, but then progress. Um, this data supported the data supporting this, uh,

305
0:33:55,920 --> 0:34:01,760
EUA, uh, was based on four clinical trials. Um, and we've talked about, I think most of these,

306
0:34:01,760 --> 0:34:08,000
they included one randomized controlled open label platform trial, uh, that was recovery,

307
0:34:08,000 --> 0:34:15,600
three randomized double blind placebo controlled trials, impacta, covecta, and remdacta.

308
0:34:15,600 --> 0:34:20,400
While all the four clinical trials contributed, um, the most important as far as numbers,

309
0:34:20,400 --> 0:34:26,320
potential benefit came from the recovery and the impacta trial. So just to remind people, um,

310
0:34:26,320 --> 0:34:31,840
of those trials, um, but to put this in, in context, person ends up in the hospital.

311
0:34:31,840 --> 0:34:36,960
You've started remdesivir. You're supporting them with oxygen. You've started steroids.

312
0:34:36,960 --> 0:34:41,760
Their oxygen requirement increases. That's where you think about tosyllism app.

313
0:34:42,320 --> 0:34:47,360
The recovery trial was the trial that looked at over 4,000 hospitalized patients, uh,

314
0:34:47,360 --> 0:34:53,840
with severe, um, COVID-19. Um, and this study demonstrated a statistically significant reduction

315
0:34:53,840 --> 0:35:02,880
in risk of death and time in the hospital. Um, the impacta trial, a smaller trial, 389 hospitalized

316
0:35:02,880 --> 0:35:11,120
patients, um, also demonstrated, um, benefit, uh, a decreased risk for ending up on a ventilator

317
0:35:11,120 --> 0:35:17,360
and also a decreased risk of death. Um, but to reinforce timing really matters,

318
0:35:17,360 --> 0:35:22,880
the benefit is only seen in those patients with an elevated inflammatory markers that

319
0:35:22,880 --> 0:35:27,840
progressed to higher oxygen requirements despite steroids. Um, and there's a time window. You

320
0:35:27,840 --> 0:35:33,200
want to give this, um, less than 48 hours after they escalate. If they escalate, they're on a

321
0:35:33,200 --> 0:35:38,800
ventilator. You wait till day three. Um, you may just be, um, increasing their, their risk of

322
0:35:38,800 --> 0:35:45,520
opportunistic infections. All right. This has been long enough, but let's finish with long COVID.

323
0:35:45,520 --> 0:35:49,920
Um, there's really a nice perspective in the New England Journal of Medicine. Um, and it was

324
0:35:49,920 --> 0:35:57,120
entitled confronting our next national health disaster, long haul COVID. Um, and the authors

325
0:35:57,120 --> 0:36:04,560
suggest that factoring in new infections in unvaccinated people, we can conservatively expect

326
0:36:04,560 --> 0:36:12,560
more than 15 million cases of long COVID resulting from this pandemic. Um, even though the data is

327
0:36:12,560 --> 0:36:19,920
still emerging, um, the average age of patients with long COVID is about 40, um, which means that

328
0:36:19,920 --> 0:36:25,680
the majority of these individuals are in their prime working years. Um, and they, they discuss

329
0:36:25,680 --> 0:36:31,200
that giving these demographics long COVID is likely to cast a long shadow on our healthcare system

330
0:36:31,200 --> 0:36:35,680
and the economic recovery that everyone is talking about. Um, and this is certainly

331
0:36:35,680 --> 0:36:41,600
something we're continuing to see. Um, I'll conclude there before we hit emails. Um, but again,

332
0:36:41,600 --> 0:36:46,960
to remind everyone, um, we are continuing to support foundation international medical relief

333
0:36:46,960 --> 0:36:51,360
of children. Um, so drop what you're doing, pull over to the side of the road, go to parasites

334
0:36:51,360 --> 0:36:56,800
without borders.com, um, and donate so that we can continue to help them and continue to provide

335
0:36:56,800 --> 0:37:02,720
this, um, weekly COVID clinical update. Daniel, I just want to point out that transmission trial

336
0:37:02,720 --> 0:37:09,440
in the UK or the, the observational study was only, most of the people were only after one dose,

337
0:37:09,440 --> 0:37:15,600
so it could be better after two. That, that is, that is encouraging. All right, time for some

338
0:37:15,600 --> 0:37:21,360
email. You can send yours to Daniel at microb.tv. Mark writes, I wanted to bring your attention

339
0:37:21,360 --> 0:37:26,960
that there are an estimated 9 million Americans living abroad for work of retirement where

340
0:37:26,960 --> 0:37:32,560
they're temporary trap. I'm based in Southeast Asia for work. I can return, but for many Americans,

341
0:37:32,560 --> 0:37:36,880
it's too expensive or dangerous. The US State Department has failed to respond to this group,

342
0:37:37,520 --> 0:37:42,480
something that would be easy to address via the embassies and consulates. I've written to Dr.

343
0:37:42,480 --> 0:37:47,840
Francis Collins requesting this issue be raised. My question is if we can ship millions of vaccines

344
0:37:47,840 --> 0:37:52,400
to India, why can't we also take care of at risk Americans currently residing outside the US? I've

345
0:37:52,400 --> 0:37:56,800
written to the New York Times and Washington Post with no response. I would appreciate you raising

346
0:37:56,800 --> 0:38:01,040
the issue on Twiv and forwarding my message to those persons you believe could be helpful in moving

347
0:38:01,040 --> 0:38:06,800
this forward. And I mean, you're, you're making really good points here. Um, we do know, right,

348
0:38:06,800 --> 0:38:11,120
that the State Department has shipped vaccines to those embassies to vaccinate their staff.

349
0:38:11,120 --> 0:38:20,080
My brother-in-law is actually in the State Department stationed in Ukraine with his family. So Tim

350
0:38:20,080 --> 0:38:25,440
Juliet and their three kids. And actually, people may know my other connection to the State Department.

351
0:38:25,440 --> 0:38:32,160
My wife's father was a US ambassador. He was Career State Department. And yeah, this is a tough

352
0:38:32,160 --> 0:38:38,960
situation. The they are, they have sent limited amounts of vaccines to vaccinate State Department

353
0:38:38,960 --> 0:38:44,240
personnel. But they really haven't, you know, expanded that out to the millions of expats that

354
0:38:44,240 --> 0:38:50,000
you describe. And I'm not sure what the political thinking is, is behind that. I mean, these are,

355
0:38:50,000 --> 0:38:54,320
these are American citizens. We're supposed to be looking out for them. And right now in the middle

356
0:38:54,320 --> 0:39:01,360
of a pandemic, looking out for someone is getting them access to a vaccine. So yeah, well, I guess

357
0:39:01,360 --> 0:39:06,640
our listeners can all hear, hear this letter read on the air and hopefully something will happen.

358
0:39:06,640 --> 0:39:10,400
Joy writes, there's an active clinical trial for use of monoclonals.

359
0:39:10,400 --> 0:39:14,800
The Laronlem app for treating long haulers. I signed up for it in last January, but got

360
0:39:14,800 --> 0:39:19,520
reinfected again before the trial began. I think there are a couple of other trials being conducted

361
0:39:19,520 --> 0:39:24,640
since there are no treatment options for long COVID, M-I-S-C-P-A-S-E. I'm wondering,

362
0:39:24,640 --> 0:39:30,080
why are they not testing Regeneron, etc. for that purpose? Us long haulers know who we are.

363
0:39:30,080 --> 0:39:35,440
Sadly, many of us are being gaslit by the medical community. My doc has known me for most of my

364
0:39:35,440 --> 0:39:40,080
life and didn't recognize this as a condition until recently. After more than a year, I'm deeply

365
0:39:40,080 --> 0:39:45,920
sad and this isn't getting enough attention. After 18 months, still no medical code. My doctor

366
0:39:45,920 --> 0:39:50,240
doesn't even know how to refer me to a specialist for it. My insurance will cover the long-term

367
0:39:50,240 --> 0:39:55,440
effects were being denied care because our doctors are unable to code for it. I was unable to get

368
0:39:55,440 --> 0:40:01,120
monoclonals after my most recent infection because my doctor didn't know how to prescribe the infusion

369
0:40:01,120 --> 0:40:05,840
regarding PASK. Hope you can give us long haulers some hope and insight because the public health

370
0:40:05,840 --> 0:40:13,440
and medicine system is moving too slow. Joy? Yeah. Joy, it is moving too slow. I'm going to

371
0:40:13,440 --> 0:40:19,600
echo that. I mentioned last time, and maybe you can write this down and tell your physician,

372
0:40:20,320 --> 0:40:28,640
but we were encouraged to currently use the code B94.8 to identify these individual, and that is for

373
0:40:28,640 --> 0:40:34,720
sequelae of other specified infections and parasitic diseases. We are hoping in October, and I think

374
0:40:34,720 --> 0:40:41,200
this is always shocking to me. We're hoping in October we'll be using U09.9, but what are we

375
0:40:41,200 --> 0:40:45,520
supposed to do in the meantime? It reminded me of one of the discussions at one of the hospitals

376
0:40:45,520 --> 0:40:48,880
where they felt like one medicine was not really effective, and they said, we're going to stop

377
0:40:48,880 --> 0:40:53,760
using it on Friday. And I'm like, I'm going to stop using it today. So why don't we have a code

378
0:40:53,760 --> 0:40:58,720
and start using it today, crazy as that seems. What I will say, and this is encouraging,

379
0:40:58,720 --> 0:41:04,400
is there's a lot of money, and there's a lot of interest in trying to find treatments for

380
0:41:05,040 --> 0:41:10,160
you, for the people suffering with long COVID. A big thing is we want to do it right. What did

381
0:41:10,160 --> 0:41:14,880
we learn over the last 18 months? We can spend a lot of money and do a lot of trials and find

382
0:41:14,880 --> 0:41:20,080
out nothing. It's very easy to do a bad trial. So that was actually what was triggering my

383
0:41:20,080 --> 0:41:25,840
conversation with Melissa Stockwell, is there's a lot of centers that are now in stage one phase,

384
0:41:25,840 --> 0:41:31,280
and it's going to then move into stage two. And there will be centers all around the country,

385
0:41:31,280 --> 0:41:38,320
PASC, so post-acute squelly of COVID centers, where patients will go for treatment. They will

386
0:41:38,320 --> 0:41:44,240
also go for the opportunity to participate in research, because we do not have a lot to offer.

387
0:41:44,240 --> 0:41:48,880
I think I mentioned in the past, there was this suggestion that we would send people to these

388
0:41:48,880 --> 0:41:54,480
centers of excellence. Well, it's not a center of excellence until we can provide excellence.

389
0:41:55,040 --> 0:41:59,520
And we're not there yet. We don't have a lot of answers. The research, the clinical trials that

390
0:41:59,520 --> 0:42:04,560
are all being set up are going to give us those answers, and then we will have centers of excellence.

391
0:42:04,560 --> 0:42:09,920
So I want to say I'm very optimistic, but yeah, it is moving too slowly. And if you have long

392
0:42:09,920 --> 0:42:15,200
COVID, it's moving much too slowly. Tom writes, our son will turn 12 early July plans to get

393
0:42:15,200 --> 0:42:19,920
vaccinated on his birthday during your show last week. You mentioned the study on college athletes

394
0:42:19,920 --> 0:42:25,120
responded to a parent email about myocarditis, pointing out that the long-term risk from natural

395
0:42:25,120 --> 0:42:29,600
infection is much greater than from vaccination. We're also hearing some doctors saying that the

396
0:42:29,600 --> 0:42:35,600
first dose might be okay, but too for a child, too much, too risky. How much does the first dose of

397
0:42:35,600 --> 0:42:41,920
vaccine decrease the infection risk compared to the second dose? How much does the myocarditis risk

398
0:42:41,920 --> 0:42:46,960
from the vaccine increase between first and second dose? Are you recommending one dose or two for a

399
0:42:46,960 --> 0:42:54,880
12-year-old male? Yeah, so we are. I am recommending two doses of the mRNA vaccine for a 12-year-old.

400
0:42:55,840 --> 0:43:01,760
And the reason we say that is all the evidence has suggested that this is a true prime boost

401
0:43:01,760 --> 0:43:08,320
vaccination series. So that initial vaccination gets us a little bit of T cell, a low level of

402
0:43:08,320 --> 0:43:13,840
antibodies. We've seen some of the data out of the UK, particularly against the delta variant,

403
0:43:13,840 --> 0:43:19,040
not a lot of protection. You get that second dose, and you really get a boost. The antibodies

404
0:43:19,040 --> 0:43:26,240
really go up, and the real-world data suggests that then you are protected. So we see the myocarditis

405
0:43:26,240 --> 0:43:31,520
after that second dose. We now see that there is a certain connection here. It's been sort of,

406
0:43:32,480 --> 0:43:37,680
I guess, pinned down, and we have a sense of what the rate is, what to expect. But if you want that

407
0:43:37,680 --> 0:43:44,320
protection against COVID-19, maybe for a lifetime in an adolescent, I encourage two shots.

408
0:43:44,320 --> 0:43:51,520
And Lori writes, Lori's a Canadian working in Kazakhstan. They received two doses of Sputnik,

409
0:43:51,520 --> 0:43:56,160
but now when they come back to Canada, they're not recognized. The vaccine is not recognized by

410
0:43:56,160 --> 0:44:02,320
Health Canada, so they have to be revaccinated. And so the question is, we had two doses of Sputnik

411
0:44:02,320 --> 0:44:09,360
in May is two doses of another vaccine in July, bad for the body. I wouldn't say bad for the body.

412
0:44:10,400 --> 0:44:16,320
You may experience some reactogenicity. I would expect that. We're seeing lots of people in the

413
0:44:16,320 --> 0:44:20,800
situation you're in in Canada and the United States, other places that have the same policy.

414
0:44:21,920 --> 0:44:28,000
You're going to get a little bit of extra protection, maybe. But I think it's fine to go ahead. I think

415
0:44:28,000 --> 0:44:35,040
it's safe and will be effective. That's COVID-19 clinical update number 69 with Dr. Daniel Griffin.

416
0:44:35,040 --> 0:45:04,880
Thank you, Daniel. Thank you, Vincent. Thank you, everyone, and be safe.
