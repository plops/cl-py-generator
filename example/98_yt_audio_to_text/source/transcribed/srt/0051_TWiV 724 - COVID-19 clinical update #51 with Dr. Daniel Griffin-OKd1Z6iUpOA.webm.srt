This week in virology, the podcast about viruses, the kind that make you sick.

2
0:00:10,320 --> 0:00:23,040
From Microbe TV, this is Twiv, this week in virology, episode 724, recorded on February 25th, 2021.

3
0:00:23,040 --> 0:00:28,240
I'm Vincent Rackeniello, and you are listening to the podcast all about viruses.

4
0:00:28,240 --> 0:00:31,920
Joining me today from New York, Daniel Griffin.

5
0:00:33,120 --> 0:00:39,600
Hello, everyone. This is clinical update 51, Daniel, moving into the second year. Maybe

6
0:00:39,600 --> 0:00:46,320
we will not have to go another year, right? You know, I'm hoping we don't, actually, to be honest.

7
0:00:46,320 --> 0:00:53,760
I mean, we're coming up on some dates that about a year ago. We were just a few days from before

8
0:00:53,760 --> 0:00:59,760
we identified, or I should say, before we could prove that we had identified the first case of

9
0:00:59,760 --> 0:01:05,280
community transmission of COVID in New York City. People may remember it was a leap year. It was

10
0:01:05,280 --> 0:01:10,800
Sunday. I was on a call with all the pro-health clinicians, hundreds of them. We actually have

11
0:01:10,800 --> 0:01:14,800
about 1,000 in New York alone, and then more, if you look at the whole tri-state area.

12
0:01:15,520 --> 0:01:19,760
And it was when the call came in, yes, the Westchester patient has tested positive.

13
0:01:19,760 --> 0:01:25,360
I don't know if people remember that, but he was one of our patients. We were getting concerns

14
0:01:25,360 --> 0:01:29,840
in November that we were seeing a lot of respiratory illnesses that we could not identify.

15
0:01:30,720 --> 0:01:35,920
And then this gentleman got quite ill back and forth. We're not able to get him tested

16
0:01:35,920 --> 0:01:42,080
initially. And then finally, February 29th got the result back. And then he ended up being taken

17
0:01:42,080 --> 0:01:48,640
care of by some of my colleagues at Columbia, which that was about a year ago. Well, when this

18
0:01:48,640 --> 0:01:54,800
drops, it'll be right about a year ago that that happened. Let's get going. We have a lot to cover

19
0:01:54,800 --> 0:02:01,600
today. But let me start off with my quotation. You wouldn't worry so much about what others think

20
0:02:01,600 --> 0:02:08,320
of you if you realized how seldom they do. And that's Eleanor Roosevelt. I was just

21
0:02:09,280 --> 0:02:13,280
rereading that and trying to figure out if she meant that they didn't think a lot or they didn't

22
0:02:13,280 --> 0:02:18,400
think about you a lot or how exactly to interpret that. But what an amazing woman Eleanor

23
0:02:18,400 --> 0:02:25,600
Roosevelt. But the reason I picked that is that just to shout out to all the people that have been

24
0:02:25,600 --> 0:02:31,920
will say, speaking truth, keeping us focused on the science and the evidence during this really

25
0:02:31,920 --> 0:02:38,320
difficult year. And actually, I'll say sort of all the abuse that those people have taken because

26
0:02:38,320 --> 0:02:44,720
they were willing to stand up and speak the truth. So a shout out to everyone that has done that.

27
0:02:44,720 --> 0:02:51,760
Vincent, I put you in that crowd. So thank you for suffering the slings and arrows and keeping

28
0:02:51,760 --> 0:02:57,840
keeping on point. My three quotations, never miss an opportunity to vaccinate, never miss an

29
0:02:57,840 --> 0:03:04,240
opportunity to test, never waste a vaccine dose. And I guess maybe the last should be, we don't need

30
0:03:04,240 --> 0:03:10,560
freezers, we need arms. Over half a million people have died here in the US from COVID.

31
0:03:10,560 --> 0:03:18,160
And I think that's been a very difficult number for a lot of people to grasp. I really enjoyed

32
0:03:18,160 --> 0:03:23,840
the most recent wave and I think people should listen to it. Really trying to get a human face

33
0:03:23,840 --> 0:03:29,600
on this. It's not just about numbers. I recently took care of a father and a daughter with COVID.

34
0:03:29,600 --> 0:03:36,800
They both died. The daughter was significantly younger than I am. So we can't we can't forget

35
0:03:36,800 --> 0:03:43,440
what a terrible disease COVID is, even as I think we're making progress. Another thing I wanted to

36
0:03:43,440 --> 0:03:49,840
reinforce and I try to bring this up repeatedly is that COVID is largely an outpatient disease.

37
0:03:50,560 --> 0:03:55,440
I think we're getting even better at keeping it that way at decreasing the percent of people

38
0:03:55,440 --> 0:04:00,240
that end up requiring hospitalization. But the majority of COVID encounters

39
0:04:00,240 --> 0:04:06,720
have been in the outpatient setting. In the New York, tri-state area, it's been urgent

40
0:04:06,720 --> 0:04:13,280
care centers. It's at primary care centers. I would talk more about outpatient therapies.

41
0:04:13,280 --> 0:04:17,600
And I try to when I can, if there were more studies helping to guide us. And I think

42
0:04:17,600 --> 0:04:23,760
a lack of a network to get evidence-based guidance is a failing. And hopefully one that gets corrected

43
0:04:23,760 --> 0:04:30,080
prior to the next pandemic. I also think there's a lack of appreciation that COVID is mainly

44
0:04:30,080 --> 0:04:35,040
an outpatient disease when we see the vaccine rollout. And I know I've had some conversations

45
0:04:35,040 --> 0:04:41,680
with politicians about the fact that I know we focused a lot on frontline hospital personnel.

46
0:04:42,240 --> 0:04:50,240
But can you imagine if we lost those frontline staff and clinicians in the urgent care centers,

47
0:04:50,240 --> 0:04:54,720
in the primary care centers that have really been stemming the tide, giving people

48
0:04:54,720 --> 0:05:01,760
care without them having to go to ERs and hospitals. So I am happy to see the vaccination centers

49
0:05:01,760 --> 0:05:05,680
finally being set up in zip codes that were hardest hit by the pandemic. So I see that as

50
0:05:05,680 --> 0:05:11,360
being something positive. And I will say, right along in this area, when we get to monoclonals,

51
0:05:11,360 --> 0:05:16,960
when they initially were being studied, right, when Steve Katani and I had that conversation with

52
0:05:16,960 --> 0:05:23,520
Regeneron in early April, we basically said, hey, let's make this happen. And I think it's been

53
0:05:23,520 --> 0:05:29,280
tremendous as we'll get to some of the recently published data that we have really effective

54
0:05:29,280 --> 0:05:35,520
antiviral monoclonals that we can use that are really tremendously effective. Also, my other

55
0:05:35,520 --> 0:05:41,360
disclaimer, I also want to remind our listeners that my goal here is to provide the latest

56
0:05:41,360 --> 0:05:48,480
evidence-based guidance on COVID-19. And I discuss whatever new data comes out. I also discuss

57
0:05:48,480 --> 0:05:55,360
data in preprint form. So I'll have a chance to talk about that as we go further. But there

58
0:05:55,360 --> 0:06:00,480
isn't good new data for me to bring up and discuss, then we just really don't have an opportunity to

59
0:06:00,480 --> 0:06:08,080
discuss those subjects. So pre-exposure period, New York City is now recommending two masks instead

60
0:06:08,080 --> 0:06:14,640
of just one. But I'll go a little bit into this. One thing is I'm going to recommend we outlaw

61
0:06:14,640 --> 0:06:21,600
beards. My wife actually and my daughter Eloise had an experience where, fortunately, my daughter

62
0:06:21,600 --> 0:06:27,280
Eloise has really severe migraines. And they were in an ER at a hospital where a gentleman was there

63
0:06:28,160 --> 0:06:33,760
with acute COVID waiting for his bambling of a map to be set up. And he had, you know,

64
0:06:33,760 --> 0:06:43,120
large face, a large beard. It's very hard to get a tight, proper fit of a mask if you have a beard.

65
0:06:43,120 --> 0:06:46,240
So sorry about that. I used to have a beard when I was younger. And I have to admit,

66
0:06:46,240 --> 0:06:51,200
why did I shave off my beard? It was so that the N95 mask would fit better when I was seeing

67
0:06:51,200 --> 0:06:57,840
tuberculosis patients. So you do want to make sure that you have a mask that fits properly.

68
0:06:58,880 --> 0:07:04,960
You can wear an K and 95 alone. So if you'd really don't want to go to the double masking,

69
0:07:04,960 --> 0:07:10,560
which is now being recommended in New York City, you can just get a K and 95. They're actually

70
0:07:10,560 --> 0:07:16,320
reasonably comfortable. And actually, now it sounds like there's going to be a public

71
0:07:16,320 --> 0:07:22,720
transportation mask mandate, a little bit more on the masking testing. There was actually a nice

72
0:07:22,720 --> 0:07:30,800
paper in CID modeling effectiveness of testing strategies to prevent COVID-19 in nursing homes,

73
0:07:30,800 --> 0:07:36,720
United States 2020. And it's a very interesting paper looking at the potential impact of different

74
0:07:36,720 --> 0:07:44,480
testing frequency and resulting delays on preventing COVID-19 cases. Can you guess what the conclusion

75
0:07:44,480 --> 0:07:51,760
was? Frequency is more important than sensitivity. Getting results right away is really critical.

76
0:07:51,760 --> 0:07:58,640
Those resulting delays have a really negative impact. So very similar to results to what we

77
0:07:58,640 --> 0:08:05,280
demonstrated for the school testing with frequency being more important than sensitivity. And over

78
0:08:05,280 --> 0:08:12,080
92% of cases being prevented with daily point of care testing in this study.

79
0:08:13,280 --> 0:08:19,280
We had some several papers demonstrating that certain approaches can reduce COVID-19

80
0:08:19,280 --> 0:08:25,520
in this particular nursing home population. So I published a paper along with Scott

81
0:08:25,520 --> 0:08:32,400
Shimatsu, Ariel Johnson, and Ethan Burke in the February volume 27 number two of the CDC MMWR.

82
0:08:32,400 --> 0:08:41,120
Hey, that's this month. This was not a modeling, but an actual observation of a 17-fold lower

83
0:08:41,120 --> 0:08:45,760
case rate, the neighboring facilities with the introduction of testing strategies and other

84
0:08:45,760 --> 0:08:52,800
measures. That's COVID-19 infection control measures in long-term care facility, Pennsylvania USA.

85
0:08:52,800 --> 0:08:58,160
I know right now there's a lot going on with the nursing homes, a lot of attention there.

86
0:08:58,160 --> 0:09:03,920
But I just to point out, we can keep this population safe. Testing appears to be critical as part of

87
0:09:03,920 --> 0:09:09,040
these plans. And I think, you know, a lot of people say, and maybe I agree with this. I do agree with

88
0:09:09,040 --> 0:09:15,840
this. You can judge a society by how we treat our most vulnerable. Active vaccination. More

89
0:09:15,840 --> 0:09:24,160
information here suggesting that people who previously had COVID get a very robust boost with just one

90
0:09:24,160 --> 0:09:29,120
vaccine dose. There are a couple papers, but the one I thought that was the most compelling was

91
0:09:29,840 --> 0:09:36,400
robust spike antibody responses and increased reactor genicity in seropositive individuals

92
0:09:36,400 --> 0:09:43,200
after a single dose of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine. It was posted as a preprint at a melt Sinai.

93
0:09:43,840 --> 0:09:48,640
And they reported that the antibody response to the first vaccine dose in individuals with

94
0:09:48,640 --> 0:09:55,600
pre-existing seropositivity was equal to or actually exceeded the titers found in naive

95
0:09:55,600 --> 0:10:01,600
individuals after the second dose. They put forth a short report on 109 individuals,

96
0:10:02,320 --> 0:10:10,080
68, zero negative, 41, zero positive. And the antibody titers with pre-existing seropositivity

97
0:10:10,080 --> 0:10:15,600
exceeded the median antibody titers in naive individuals after the second vaccine dose by more

98
0:10:15,600 --> 0:10:22,720
than 10 fold. So there's some complexity here. This is not a recommendation. We're not saying

99
0:10:22,720 --> 0:10:28,160
people who've been previously infected should only get one dose. The recommendation is still

100
0:10:28,160 --> 0:10:35,760
for two doses, but just we're getting information here. And we'll look forward to seeing how this

101
0:10:35,760 --> 0:10:41,200
all pans out. Jay and Jay, very exciting. By the time this drops, we're expecting that they'll be

102
0:10:41,200 --> 0:10:48,560
EUA for this one and done, add no viral vector-based vaccine. Come next week, we'll have all the data

103
0:10:48,560 --> 0:10:53,040
presented to the FDA. So I promise to take a deeper dive. We're really going to go into the

104
0:10:53,040 --> 0:10:59,120
details of what we know. And apparently, there's some rumors that there's some data on reduction

105
0:10:59,120 --> 0:11:05,600
in asymptomatic cases. So that's going to directly speak to potential for transmission

106
0:11:05,600 --> 0:11:11,120
and, you know, behaviors that people who are vaccinated and get past that period of time

107
0:11:11,760 --> 0:11:17,600
might be able to engage in. And along those lines, I'm going to comment on what we call

108
0:11:17,600 --> 0:11:22,960
what is vaccine alarmism? What is this? And this is this idea that maybe we're underselling

109
0:11:22,960 --> 0:11:26,880
the vaccine. And a lot of people are saying, well, if I can't change behavior, if it doesn't

110
0:11:26,880 --> 0:11:33,760
change anything, well, why am I even bothering to do this? And there's been a parallel drawn

111
0:11:33,760 --> 0:11:38,320
between masks and vaccines. So perhaps people remember, back in March, when there was the

112
0:11:38,320 --> 0:11:43,520
mask controversy, you know, if masks aren't effective, why did doctors and nurses need them?

113
0:11:44,320 --> 0:11:49,920
And then later, when there was endorsement of masks, people were kind of upset. So sort of

114
0:11:49,920 --> 0:11:55,280
maybe some credibility damage there. But I know that people that work in the government

115
0:11:55,920 --> 0:12:01,680
really have to stick to the party line. And there's a real, let's not get in front of the

116
0:12:01,680 --> 0:12:07,360
science, let's not oversell, let's not have to walk anything back. But I will say we're getting

117
0:12:07,360 --> 0:12:14,160
more and more encouraging information. We do live in a community. If you get a vaccination,

118
0:12:14,160 --> 0:12:20,960
yes, there's really impressive data on your safety. We're learning more and we suspect and the data

119
0:12:20,960 --> 0:12:26,080
is supporting that you are probably less likely to transmit it to others. But remember, there's a

120
0:12:26,080 --> 0:12:30,480
lot of people who have not had an opportunity to get vaccinated yet. It's a decent thing to

121
0:12:30,480 --> 0:12:35,840
continue to wear a mask. And I think I'm probably preaching to the choir based up on who listens to

122
0:12:35,840 --> 0:12:44,400
Twiff. But in mid January, less than half of the vaccines were in arms. It was actually Andy Slavitt

123
0:12:44,400 --> 0:12:52,960
was saying it was 46% as of the January 20th. We are now at over 80% of those vaccines are in

124
0:12:52,960 --> 0:12:59,760
arms. Weekly distributions are up over 60% from mid January. We're hearing prediction of

125
0:12:59,760 --> 0:13:04,800
increased production and distribution going forward. And actually, as long as everything goes

126
0:13:04,800 --> 0:13:11,040
smoothly with J and J, we're expecting millions of doses of J and J to be added to the supply as

127
0:13:11,040 --> 0:13:17,120
early as next week, and then ramp up from there to the period of detectable viral replication or

128
0:13:17,120 --> 0:13:23,120
that viral symptom phase. As I started off, despite so much focus on hospitals and ICUs,

129
0:13:23,120 --> 0:13:31,120
80 to 90% of COVID patients never require hospitalization. And the number that end up in the ICU,

130
0:13:31,120 --> 0:13:36,560
the percentage is really only in the single digits. This is predominantly an outpatient disease.

131
0:13:36,560 --> 0:13:43,440
This is the ideal time in that first week to jump in and do something. So we discussed the Eli Lilly

132
0:13:43,440 --> 0:13:50,560
data previously. When it was announced, it's now published in JAMA. And this was the article

133
0:13:50,560 --> 0:13:58,240
effect of bamlinibimab as monotherapy or in combination with a test of a map on viral load

134
0:13:58,240 --> 0:14:04,080
in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19, a randomized clinical trial. And really nothing

135
0:14:04,080 --> 0:14:10,640
surprising, pretty much similar to what we had heard last time. They reported an 84% reduction

136
0:14:10,640 --> 0:14:16,640
in COVID-19 related hospitalizations or ED visits. And those going on to require hospitalization,

137
0:14:16,640 --> 0:14:22,560
no escalation ICU in the treatment group. There was a patient who got placebo who ended up in

138
0:14:22,560 --> 0:14:29,200
the ICU. This is really a game-changing, tremendously powerful therapeutic that we have.

139
0:14:29,200 --> 0:14:34,240
I know we've been, everyone's been learning a new vocabulary. Maybe it's useful to think of these

140
0:14:34,240 --> 0:14:39,760
as our monoclonal antivirals. People say, where are the antivirals? This is our most effective

141
0:14:39,760 --> 0:14:44,400
antiviral. And you're basically, you got to do the numbers. You can't let someone get sick.

142
0:14:44,400 --> 0:14:50,160
We're having tremendous success. I think I've mentioned our United in research, my COVID-19

143
0:14:50,160 --> 0:14:57,120
plan, which now has 450,000 people enrolled. The option to get tested in the home, hundreds of

144
0:14:57,120 --> 0:15:03,520
people are getting bamlinibimab monoclonal infusions in the home. But this is really going to take,

145
0:15:03,520 --> 0:15:09,760
I think, continued education. If someone is carrying that extra weight, be a migrator than 35

146
0:15:09,760 --> 0:15:14,240
kidney disease, diabetes, immunosuppressive disease, or immunosuppressive treatment.

147
0:15:14,960 --> 0:15:20,240
You're 65 or older, or you're 55 with heart disease, lung disease, hypertension,

148
0:15:20,960 --> 0:15:25,680
or you have a major health issue. You are at high risk. Don't wait till you're sick. Don't

149
0:15:25,680 --> 0:15:31,360
let that window close. Let's go ahead and make sure we keep people out of the hospital.

150
0:15:32,800 --> 0:15:36,960
The last night, my wife was actually asking me, she's standing. Are you okay? You look like

151
0:15:36,960 --> 0:15:43,120
you're not okay. As I told Vincent before the show, my comment, my reply was, you noticed.

152
0:15:44,000 --> 0:15:52,800
I usually try to keep a positive outward appearance, but no, this is devastating to see all these

153
0:15:52,800 --> 0:16:00,320
people end up in the hospital and on ventilators. We can keep a large percentage of people out of

154
0:16:00,320 --> 0:16:05,280
the hospital. If you listen, if you're aware of this, spread the word. Let's make that happen.

155
0:16:05,280 --> 0:16:11,120
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories for COVID. I'll even make sure I jump in on vaccines with that.

156
0:16:11,120 --> 0:16:16,800
Early on, there was a letter from a concerned pediatrician, a group of pediatricians in France

157
0:16:16,800 --> 0:16:24,160
about not using ibuprofen or napkin or aspirin and the like in people with COVID. But we now know

158
0:16:24,160 --> 0:16:31,680
that it is safe to use ibuprofen, napkin, aspirin, Tylenol to help with the myelgis, the headaches,

159
0:16:31,680 --> 0:16:38,720
the fevers. And there was a nice paper that made it into print, peer reviewed article in the BMJ

160
0:16:38,720 --> 0:16:44,640
annals of rheumatic diseases, use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and risk of death from

161
0:16:44,640 --> 0:16:52,240
COVID-19, an open safely cohort analysis based on two cohorts. This was very robust data. They

162
0:16:52,240 --> 0:16:59,520
looked at over 2.5 million individuals, and they observed no evidence of difference in risk of

163
0:16:59,520 --> 0:17:06,320
COVID-19 related deaths with NSAID use. So really, really powerful, robust data.

164
0:17:06,320 --> 0:17:09,920
Another article that I've been getting a lot of questions about, and this was an article posted

165
0:17:09,920 --> 0:17:16,720
as a preprint that is generated a lot of questions, inhaled butesenite in the treatment of early

166
0:17:16,720 --> 0:17:24,400
COVID-19 illness, a randomized control trial. So what is butesenite? This is an inhaled steroid.

167
0:17:24,400 --> 0:17:31,200
This was a randomized open label trial of inhaled butesenite compared to usual care. So the

168
0:17:31,200 --> 0:17:36,240
physicians are aware, the patients are aware who's getting treatment, who isn't. It was in

169
0:17:36,240 --> 0:17:42,080
adults within seven days of that first week when we usually are thinking we don't want to expose

170
0:17:42,080 --> 0:17:48,240
folks to steroids. The primary endpoint was whether or not there was an urgent care visit,

171
0:17:48,240 --> 0:17:55,280
an emergency department assessment, or hospitalization. The trial was stopped early, and the primary

172
0:17:55,280 --> 0:18:01,280
outcome occurred in 10 participants and one participant in the usual care, and the bedesenite

173
0:18:01,280 --> 0:18:10,160
arms respectively. The difference in proportions 0.131. The number needed to treat per this report

174
0:18:10,880 --> 0:18:16,880
to reduce COVID-19 deterioration was eight. Clinical recovery was one day shorter for their

175
0:18:16,880 --> 0:18:22,560
report and then bedesenite arm compared to the usual care. So medium seven versus eight. So that

176
0:18:22,560 --> 0:18:28,080
one day difference there. If your participants randomized to bedesenite had persistent symptoms

177
0:18:28,080 --> 0:18:34,000
at day 14 versus 28. So I dug through the data a little bit to try to pull out the objective

178
0:18:34,000 --> 0:18:39,440
measures because a lot of the data you're seeing here was based upon questionnaire responses.

179
0:18:39,440 --> 0:18:43,760
And remember that doctors and the patients knew whether they got it or not. So the proportion of

180
0:18:43,760 --> 0:18:50,560
days with oxygen saturations less than 94% during the first 14 days was 19 versus 22.

181
0:18:51,280 --> 0:18:59,280
Butesenite versus the control arm. During the first 14 days 59 and 58% in the butes

182
0:18:59,280 --> 0:19:04,880
and control arms at least one day with oxygen sets less than 94%. So not seeing a huge difference

183
0:19:04,880 --> 0:19:14,000
there. They did look at the the CT values for the SARS-CoV-2 viral loads at day 07 and 14 right

184
0:19:14,000 --> 0:19:18,720
because we would have concerns that maybe giving steroids would interfere with the body's ability

185
0:19:18,720 --> 0:19:22,880
to control the virus. They were not seeing differences here. But what I could not find

186
0:19:22,880 --> 0:19:29,840
was a good breakdown of this large outcome of urgent care, emergency department or hospitalizations

187
0:19:29,840 --> 0:19:35,200
right. There's a small study and there's a big difference in my mind between whether or not you

188
0:19:35,200 --> 0:19:39,680
go to an urgent care department whether you end up in the hospital. I'd also like to see a little

189
0:19:39,680 --> 0:19:44,400
more information on the viral load and a larger end. Yeah, in a small study it's hard to show

190
0:19:44,400 --> 0:19:49,280
a statistically significant difference. So hard to know if there really was. And then the other

191
0:19:49,280 --> 0:19:54,080
and this really bothered me about the study is that to be included in the study you didn't actually

192
0:19:54,080 --> 0:20:00,880
need to have a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. You just needed symptoms suggested suggestive of

193
0:20:00,880 --> 0:20:06,960
COVID-19. So I would certainly like to see a larger study where you actually were confirmed

194
0:20:06,960 --> 0:20:12,320
that you were looking at folks with COVID-19. So prior larger studies looking at patients with

195
0:20:12,320 --> 0:20:17,840
chloronic lung disease such as asthma have not seen a signal along these lines. So I put this in

196
0:20:17,840 --> 0:20:23,360
is it interesting but not standard of care changing. And I really felt that their statement and that

197
0:20:23,360 --> 0:20:28,640
their study demonstrated that inhaled steroids were equivalent to the efficacy seen following the use

198
0:20:28,640 --> 0:20:34,480
of COVID-19 vaccines was a bit of a stretch. And I'm not sure that that's going to end up in the

199
0:20:34,480 --> 0:20:39,120
final peer reviewed publication. So just to mention that there we'll keep an eye and see

200
0:20:40,000 --> 0:20:44,560
not ready for prime time early inflammatory phase. I wanted to start by raising concern about the

201
0:20:44,560 --> 0:20:50,240
vitamin D data that we discussed on the last update. The study that we discussed was taken down

202
0:20:50,240 --> 0:20:56,480
and there's now an investigation into the research. So we'll keep an eye on this as we go forward.

203
0:20:56,480 --> 0:21:02,160
But I know our longtime listeners are familiar with my personal stance on preprints and how I'm

204
0:21:02,160 --> 0:21:08,000
not a particularly huge fan of doing that myself. But as you're seeing through this pandemic,

205
0:21:08,000 --> 0:21:14,640
we've been actually using preprints quite a bit trying to review them. And the reality is these

206
0:21:14,640 --> 0:21:19,680
have not gone through a peer review process. And this is actually really critical. And I think this

207
0:21:19,680 --> 0:21:26,240
reinforced by this, even with the peer review process, right? We've had papers that were later

208
0:21:26,240 --> 0:21:32,000
retracted from journals as prestigious as the Lancet. This was the Lancet preprint server where

209
0:21:32,000 --> 0:21:37,600
this was pulled from. But it was very interesting to see it started to undergo something of a public

210
0:21:37,600 --> 0:21:43,760
peer review process. People were commenting. And what they realized here was that the randomization

211
0:21:43,760 --> 0:21:50,320
was suspect. It wasn't as though patients were getting placebo or vitamin D. People on certain

212
0:21:50,320 --> 0:21:55,920
wards were getting vitamin D, potentially wards with healthier patients were getting vitamin D,

213
0:21:55,920 --> 0:22:01,760
wards with less healthy patients were not getting vitamin D. There actually were more deaths than

214
0:22:01,760 --> 0:22:07,760
escalations to ICU level care, which seemed a little suspect as well. And then right about the

215
0:22:07,760 --> 0:22:13,600
same time that this got pulled, a peer reviewed paper on vitamin D was published in JAMA effect

216
0:22:13,600 --> 0:22:19,760
of a single high dose of vitamin D three on hospital lengths of stay in patients with moderate

217
0:22:19,760 --> 0:22:28,480
to severe COVID-19, a randomized clinical trial. So this was a proper multi center, double blind,

218
0:22:28,480 --> 0:22:35,280
randomized placebo control trial conducted at two sites in Sao Paulo, Brazil. And the study

219
0:22:35,280 --> 0:22:41,120
included 240 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who were moderately to severely ill at the time

220
0:22:41,120 --> 0:22:48,960
of enrollment. 237 were included in the primary analysis. And we do have baseline 25 hydroxy

221
0:22:48,960 --> 0:22:55,520
vitamin D levels, which were 20.9 nanograms per milliliter with standard deviation of 9.2.

222
0:22:56,240 --> 0:23:01,840
So people were coming in on average vitamin D deficient. No significant differences were seen

223
0:23:01,840 --> 0:23:09,600
in length of stay in hospital mortality admission to the intensive care unit or need for mechanical

224
0:23:09,600 --> 0:23:14,880
ventilation. The means your vitamin D levels actually were significantly increased.

225
0:23:15,600 --> 0:23:20,400
They're treating these individuals with a hundred thousand units on admission.

226
0:23:21,200 --> 0:23:26,800
So they were actually bringing them up to a level of 44.4 nanograms per milliliter.

227
0:23:26,800 --> 0:23:32,800
And so as they concluded among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, a single high dose of

228
0:23:32,800 --> 0:23:38,080
vitamin D three compared with placebo did not significantly reduce hospital length of stay.

229
0:23:38,080 --> 0:23:42,720
The findings did not support the use of high dose vitamin D three for treatment of moderate

230
0:23:42,720 --> 0:23:47,440
to severe COVID-19. So I'm going to use a Mark Chris slip line here. People listen to the

231
0:23:47,440 --> 0:23:53,440
podcast. This intervention was safe and showed a non significant association with study outcomes

232
0:23:53,440 --> 0:24:00,160
or let me translate this into it didn't do squat or to be more specific in a proper peer review

233
0:24:00,160 --> 0:24:04,960
well-designed study. There was no benefit to vitamin D. So this really brings us back to this

234
0:24:04,960 --> 0:24:10,240
earlier perspective. There's no benefit to being vitamin D deficient. But again, we don't have

235
0:24:10,240 --> 0:24:15,360
good data suggesting that starting vitamin D once you end up in the hospital is associated

236
0:24:15,360 --> 0:24:22,000
with improved outcomes more on remdesivir repurposed antiviral drugs for COVID-19.

237
0:24:22,000 --> 0:24:26,960
The interim WHO solitary trial results. We again saw little to be excited about with

238
0:24:26,960 --> 0:24:32,800
remdesivir with more results coming out of this large trial conducted at 405 hospitals in 30

239
0:24:32,800 --> 0:24:41,120
countries, 11,330 adults underwent randomization, 2,750 were assigned to receive remdesivir. And

240
0:24:41,120 --> 0:24:48,080
they found remdesivir had little to no effect on hospitalized patients with COVID-19 as indicated

241
0:24:48,080 --> 0:24:54,720
by overall mortality initiation of ventilation and duration of hospital stay. So at $3,000 per

242
0:24:54,720 --> 0:24:59,760
five day treatment, it begs the question of how much of this is medical theater at high expense

243
0:24:59,760 --> 0:25:04,480
rather than any kind of effective intervention. When a local hospital is here, there's still

244
0:25:04,480 --> 0:25:09,360
admitting patients for a 10 day course as their standard of care. We certainly does not seem

245
0:25:09,360 --> 0:25:16,080
supported by the current data moving on to the tail phase in the JAMA network open the paper

246
0:25:16,080 --> 0:25:22,880
sequelae in adults at six months after COVID-19 infection was published. A superior view article

247
0:25:22,880 --> 0:25:32,000
looked at 177 participants. They were mean age about 48, but a range of 18 to 94, 57% of them

248
0:25:32,000 --> 0:25:38,240
were women. As far as their initial COVID, and I think this is important, 6% were asymptomatic,

249
0:25:39,360 --> 0:25:45,680
84.7% were outpatients with mild illness, and only 9% had moderate or severe disease

250
0:25:45,680 --> 0:25:52,720
requiring hospitalization. The follow up was completed at a median of 169 days,

251
0:25:53,680 --> 0:26:00,400
and they found that approximately 30% reported persistent symptoms. Remember, these are mostly

252
0:26:00,400 --> 0:26:04,960
people who did not end up in the hospital. Some of these patients even had initial asymptomatic

253
0:26:04,960 --> 0:26:12,160
disease. The most common persistent symptom was fatigue, about 14%, loss of smell or taste,

254
0:26:12,160 --> 0:26:18,720
about 14%, brain fog, about 2%, and a number of other symptoms. Scientists are referring to

255
0:26:18,720 --> 0:26:27,680
long COVID now. There's a name, the post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection or P-A-S-C,

256
0:26:27,680 --> 0:26:33,360
and they're actually $1.5 billion has been allocated by the NIH specifically for research on this

257
0:26:33,360 --> 0:26:38,080
subject. And I thought Ginger Campbell on the last web did a really good job of pointing out

258
0:26:38,080 --> 0:26:45,040
that there is a sort of a chronic fatigue post-COVID, but there's really a tremendous

259
0:26:45,040 --> 0:26:49,200
spectrum of disability that patients who have survived COVID are experiencing.

260
0:26:49,840 --> 0:26:54,640
And I think this gets back to things like the monoclonals. Death is not the only end point to

261
0:26:54,640 --> 0:27:01,840
be concerned about. If a person ends up intubated, we know that you've basically lost about 10 years

262
0:27:01,840 --> 0:27:08,480
of cognitive decline. You've lost about 8.5 IQ points. A lot of individuals are having issues

263
0:27:09,280 --> 0:27:15,520
with exercise tolerance, with going up a flight of stairs. We now actually are hearing

264
0:27:15,520 --> 0:27:21,120
guidelines for younger athletes before they return to activity, getting full cardiac evaluation,

265
0:27:21,120 --> 0:27:26,400
because we're having impacts upon sports performance. We're seeing long COVID in younger

266
0:27:26,400 --> 0:27:32,480
individuals. So we need to start looking at ways of preventing that. So I always like to keep an eye

267
0:27:32,480 --> 0:27:40,640
on this. The post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 is not just the fatigue. It's not just the cognitive

268
0:27:40,640 --> 0:27:45,520
function. It's a really broad. We have people with fibrous scarred lungs. We have people with

269
0:27:45,520 --> 0:27:52,240
significant impacts on cognitive function. We have the hair loss. We have the cardiac manifestations.

270
0:27:52,240 --> 0:27:58,080
And around the country, it's springing up all these specialty centers. This is really the second

271
0:27:58,080 --> 0:28:04,240
pandemic that's really ahead of us. All the people who are hopefully not permanently,

272
0:28:04,240 --> 0:28:09,680
but at least right now, still suffering the sequelae. So before I finish, and we hit some emails,

273
0:28:10,320 --> 0:28:14,880
just remind everyone that the months of February and March, February is a short month here,

274
0:28:15,520 --> 0:28:20,720
donations made to parasites without borders will be matched and doubled and donated to the American

275
0:28:20,720 --> 0:28:25,520
Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene. And what we're trying to do here as part of our

276
0:28:26,000 --> 0:28:34,160
support is include scholarships to the annual meetings for three women from low-income parts of

277
0:28:34,160 --> 0:28:41,120
the world, really to help sort of move into the future. Right now, I know a lot of us are focused

278
0:28:41,120 --> 0:28:46,640
on vaccines and we're focused on ending this pandemic. But let's invest in the future. Let's

279
0:28:46,640 --> 0:28:51,920
help us invest in these young women, early career scientists, early career global health.

280
0:28:51,920 --> 0:28:58,640
All right. If you'd like to send an email to Daniel Daniel at microbe.tv. Ross is a

281
0:28:59,520 --> 0:29:07,760
pharmacist in Minnesota who's indebted to Daniel for having his vaccine clinics very successful.

282
0:29:07,760 --> 0:29:13,360
He personally preaches the never miss an opportunity to vaccinate and you don't need

283
0:29:13,360 --> 0:29:17,440
freezers. You need arms and everyone on my team has now been introduced to your podcast. Thank

284
0:29:17,440 --> 0:29:23,200
you for all you do. I have a question. My neighbor is 59. She's healthy. However, she's had three

285
0:29:23,200 --> 0:29:28,400
episodes of Bell's palsy looking at the data in the Moderna and Pfizer trials. It appears both

286
0:29:28,400 --> 0:29:33,680
trials had incidences. However, the rate in both trials was roughly equivalent to what you would

287
0:29:33,680 --> 0:29:38,160
expect to see in the general population. CDC currently has the following guidance cases of Bell's

288
0:29:38,160 --> 0:29:44,080
palsy were reported in participants in the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine trials. However, the FDA does not

289
0:29:44,080 --> 0:29:48,800
consider these to be above the rate expected in the general population. They have not concluded

290
0:29:48,800 --> 0:29:54,080
these cases were caused by vaccination. Therefore, persons who have previously had Bell's palsy

291
0:29:54,080 --> 0:30:00,640
may receive an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Interpreting this data can be challenging for a small number

292
0:30:00,640 --> 0:30:04,960
of cases of a rare condition. However, I find it more challenging to assess whether someone

293
0:30:04,960 --> 0:30:09,520
with a history of Bell's like my neighbor would be more susceptible to another event,

294
0:30:09,520 --> 0:30:15,120
or which he fall into that general population, 0.02% risk group. She's trying to weigh her

295
0:30:15,120 --> 0:30:21,120
dueling concerns of potentially having a paralyzed face for life versus being put in a ventilator

296
0:30:21,120 --> 0:30:25,680
if she were to suffer from a severe case of COVID-19. Two questions I'm hoping you can help me with.

297
0:30:25,680 --> 0:30:31,200
One, if she were your patient, how would you advise her concerns? Two, with the COVID vaccines

298
0:30:31,200 --> 0:30:35,760
that we have information on, which might be safest for a person with a history of Bell's

299
0:30:35,760 --> 0:30:43,840
palsy? I'm glad I'm answering this question in the end of February. Two months of experience,

300
0:30:43,840 --> 0:30:50,000
millions of people having received the vaccines, and we do have active vaccine surveillance

301
0:30:50,880 --> 0:30:57,120
adverse event reporting systems out there. We are not seeing a signal. We are not seeing any

302
0:30:57,120 --> 0:31:03,520
increase in Bell's palsy in people who did not or did get vaccinated. It's the same. I think you

303
0:31:03,520 --> 0:31:10,000
can very confidently let this individual know that there is no increased risk being seen in

304
0:31:10,000 --> 0:31:15,200
millions of people being vaccinated. You can pick up those smaller events now that we're

305
0:31:15,760 --> 0:31:20,400
vaccinating millions of people. Go right ahead. There's no reason not to get the vaccine.

306
0:31:21,200 --> 0:31:25,760
Which vaccine? The nice thing we have with the Pfizer and Moderna right now is millions of

307
0:31:25,760 --> 0:31:30,960
people who are vaccinated. We're not seeing a problem. Right now, these are the two vaccines

308
0:31:30,960 --> 0:31:36,240
with the biggest safety record here in the US with a really robust monitoring system.

309
0:31:36,240 --> 0:31:40,000
Go right ahead. I would recommend either of the mRNA vaccines for this individual.

310
0:31:40,000 --> 0:31:45,440
Jan is a registered nurse working a COVID hotline in Wisconsin. Recently, there have been some of

311
0:31:45,440 --> 0:31:49,440
our primary care physicians telling their patients they need to hold ibuprofen before

312
0:31:49,440 --> 0:31:53,680
and after they receive the vaccine. I recall you touching on this at least once. You noted

313
0:31:53,680 --> 0:31:58,720
there is no issue. Has anything changed? Is there any contradiction having a COVID vaccine

314
0:31:58,720 --> 0:32:02,880
while a patient is on an antibiotic for a bacterial infection assuming their fever

315
0:32:02,880 --> 0:32:08,160
free and symptoms are improving? Yes, this is a great question and really give me a chance to

316
0:32:08,160 --> 0:32:13,840
clarify the guidance here. You do not need to pre-medicate. We don't recommend that you do

317
0:32:13,840 --> 0:32:21,040
pre-medicate. Go in, get your vaccine, see how you do. If that next day, it usually is the next day.

318
0:32:21,040 --> 0:32:24,880
If that next day, you're feeling crummy. You're feeling washed out. You got my algae. You got

319
0:32:24,880 --> 0:32:30,480
fever. You got a headache. Even if it's the night after the vaccine, go ahead. You can take ibuprofen.

320
0:32:30,480 --> 0:32:35,920
You can take napper said and you can take aspirin or Tylenol. There are no concerns. This is what

321
0:32:35,920 --> 0:32:42,720
the CDC is advising across and welcome back CDC. But no reason to take it ahead of time. We actually

322
0:32:42,720 --> 0:32:47,280
say don't take it ahead of time. Don't don't hedge your bet. There's no reason for millions of people

323
0:32:47,280 --> 0:32:53,120
to be pre-medicated. See how you do? Most of us actually do fine. I think I mentioned with my second

324
0:32:53,120 --> 0:32:58,560
vaccine, I barely noticed. The only was like what? That few minutes of frustration when I open an

325
0:32:58,560 --> 0:33:03,520
email from my colleague, which I now think was content driven. Mary Ellen writes, my friend had

326
0:33:03,520 --> 0:33:08,800
been donating convalescent plasma. It was told after he was vaccinated with one of the mRNA vaccines,

327
0:33:08,800 --> 0:33:14,480
he could no longer donate. Why not? Why are the antibodies generated from the disease considered

328
0:33:14,480 --> 0:33:19,520
more valuable than the ones generated by vaccine? I understand the vaccine antibodies would be

329
0:33:19,520 --> 0:33:24,720
only against spike. But if the antibodies protect my friend, why won't they protect patients?

330
0:33:25,680 --> 0:33:30,720
This is fantastic and allow me to go into the weeds because this is an exciting question.

331
0:33:30,720 --> 0:33:37,600
We actually suspect that post vaccination serum will actually have higher levels

332
0:33:37,600 --> 0:33:44,720
of neutralizing antibodies, higher levels of antibodies, just in general. So I don't think

333
0:33:44,720 --> 0:33:50,880
there's any kind of science here other than the fact that what did we study? We studied convalescent

334
0:33:50,880 --> 0:33:57,520
plasma after natural infection. So you're sort of stepping out of what was studied. But in parts

335
0:33:57,520 --> 0:34:02,080
of the world that maybe aren't going to have access to monoclonal therapy in the future,

336
0:34:02,080 --> 0:34:08,240
we'll be potentially looking at post vaccination serum, post vaccination plasma,

337
0:34:08,960 --> 0:34:14,640
this hyperimmune globulin as a therapeutic. But I have to say here in the US, most of the data

338
0:34:14,640 --> 0:34:22,320
is basically saying the next generation, convalescent plasma 2.0, is actually these monoclonals.

339
0:34:23,040 --> 0:34:28,720
The best data we saw for convalescent plasma in keeping people out of the hospital was that

340
0:34:28,720 --> 0:34:36,000
study in Brazil, given within 72 hours, high-tighter neutralizing antibody, and only a 50% reduction

341
0:34:36,000 --> 0:34:41,760
in progression. When you see the most recent data, which I just discussed with the monoclonal

342
0:34:41,760 --> 0:34:49,280
antibody cocktail from Eli Lilly, 85% reduction in progression being given out to seven to 10 days,

343
0:34:49,280 --> 0:34:53,120
so even a wider window. So that would be my answer there.

344
0:34:53,120 --> 0:34:58,880
All right, one more from Mary. I've been told to wait 90 days before vaccination because I was

345
0:34:58,880 --> 0:35:05,360
given convalescent plasma. Should I wait? This is going to be one of those situations where yes,

346
0:35:06,160 --> 0:35:13,280
there's a break here. People who receive monoclonal antibodies or people who receive convalescent

347
0:35:13,280 --> 0:35:18,480
plasma, there's concern that those therapeutics will interfere with the efficacy of the vaccines.

348
0:35:18,480 --> 0:35:25,120
And that is different from someone who's had natural infection. Natural infection, we say that you

349
0:35:25,120 --> 0:35:31,440
are unlikely to get reinfected within the next 30, 90 days. So some people are saying there's no

350
0:35:31,440 --> 0:35:37,760
rush, but that actually speaks to exposure to the original wild-type virus. Now that we're seeing

351
0:35:37,760 --> 0:35:42,400
increased invariance, now that there's the potential that those variants are being driven by people

352
0:35:42,400 --> 0:35:50,480
who have waning antibodies, the CDC has said no minimal interval between infection and getting

353
0:35:50,480 --> 0:35:55,120
your vaccination. So as soon as you feel better, we're encouraging people to get vaccinated.

354
0:35:55,120 --> 0:36:01,840
That's COVID-19 clinical update number 51 with Dr. Daniel Griffin. Thank you, Daniel.

355
0:36:02,720 --> 0:36:08,160
Oh, thank you so much. And everyone, spring is just a couple months away. Let's be safe. I know

356
0:36:08,160 --> 0:36:11,760
that the governors and everyone are trying to open things up. But if you could give us another

357
0:36:11,760 --> 0:36:20,160
month or two just to get to May, that would be great.
