This week in virology, the podcast about viruses, the kind that make you sick.

2
0:00:10,240 --> 0:00:21,280
From Microbe TV, this is Twiv, this week in virology. Episode 695, recorded on December 17, 2020.

3
0:00:21,920 --> 0:00:26,560
I'm Vincent Rack and Yellow, and you're listening to the podcast All About Viruses.

4
0:00:26,560 --> 0:00:32,800
Joining me today from New York, Daniel Griffin. Hello, everyone.

5
0:00:33,760 --> 0:00:39,920
Historic Week, Daniel. It is actually, and this time the voting was a little bit quicker,

6
0:00:39,920 --> 0:00:45,520
but I'll get to that. But yeah, let's start because I've got a lot to say,

7
0:00:45,520 --> 0:00:51,200
and we want to keep this under 30 minutes for all the busy folks that want a quick update.

8
0:00:51,200 --> 0:01:00,560
So my quotation, at this historic moment, Shirley, not one of us is too busy, too young, or too old to play a part.

9
0:01:01,440 --> 0:01:06,880
And that was actually King George VI, the father of Elizabeth II.

10
0:01:07,920 --> 0:01:14,080
And he was actually speaking about D-Day. And I think this is appropriate, right? We are now

11
0:01:14,080 --> 0:01:20,000
launching massive vaccination campaigns. And this is going to take a lot of effort,

12
0:01:20,000 --> 0:01:24,400
a lot of coordination, and a lot of people are going to need to be involved to make sure that

13
0:01:24,400 --> 0:01:31,520
this actually goes from manufacturing to actually people's arms. So start a little bit with some

14
0:01:31,520 --> 0:01:39,920
patient updates. I think everyone realizes that the projected post-Thanksgiving rise is what we're

15
0:01:39,920 --> 0:01:46,880
seeing. We're setting records, numbers of people who are getting sick, numbers of people who are

16
0:01:46,880 --> 0:01:56,800
dying per day. It's quickly approaching 4,000. It's well over 3500. And I'm not in the best of

17
0:01:56,800 --> 0:02:02,880
moods when my patients die. And I had earlier this week, gentlemen, no medical problems in his

18
0:02:02,880 --> 0:02:10,080
30s who died, just had another gentleman died today. I have a teenager in the ICU who I don't

19
0:02:10,080 --> 0:02:17,200
think she's going to make it. So this is a horrible disease. Each one of these people who dies is

20
0:02:17,200 --> 0:02:24,480
someone that people love, that people care about. The vaccine is here. I just heard about an ICU

21
0:02:24,480 --> 0:02:30,080
nurse who just got diagnosed today. And I mean, the vaccines are here. So I know it's Christmas.

22
0:02:30,080 --> 0:02:35,280
I know everyone's hoping to get together. But I'm going to be the Grinch, right? And I'm going to

23
0:02:35,280 --> 0:02:40,000
say please, you know, postpone Christmas. Can we do that? I just want people to be safe.

24
0:02:41,120 --> 0:02:44,800
Yeah. I mean, I try not to be judgy, but when I see this many people dying and you know,

25
0:02:44,800 --> 0:02:49,120
I see families, they got together. They were doing nothing wrong. This is not a moral issue.

26
0:02:49,120 --> 0:02:54,720
This is just, it's really dangerous. So all right, let's go to the pre-exposure period.

27
0:02:55,680 --> 0:03:00,880
And I always like to touch on testing and a little shout out here to Rachel, the special

28
0:03:00,880 --> 0:03:07,840
assistant to the NH director of COVID-19 Diagnostics. She let me know that they appreciate the updates,

29
0:03:08,560 --> 0:03:13,200
you know, because for them, it's nice to get some feedback what's happening on the ground. So

30
0:03:13,200 --> 0:03:18,560
happy to hear that. And I'm going to give some feedbacks here and feedback. Yeah, no plural on

31
0:03:18,560 --> 0:03:27,840
that. Just feedback. This is an update, the FDA updated its FAQs on testing. And I was communicating

32
0:03:27,840 --> 0:03:33,920
a little with one of the New York Times reporters who may drop a story on this, but I told her that

33
0:03:33,920 --> 0:03:40,400
she has until Saturday morning when this episode drops. But actually, the FDA basically went ahead

34
0:03:40,400 --> 0:03:46,800
and said, okay, these tests are not approved. These PCR tests are not approved for quantitative,

35
0:03:46,800 --> 0:03:52,800
saying the quantity of virus. But go ahead, you can share those CT values with clinicians.

36
0:03:52,800 --> 0:03:58,720
And there's a bunch of caveats in there. But for me, as a practicing clinician, this is exciting.

37
0:03:59,280 --> 0:04:04,400
This is a helpful update. And there's a number of qualifications. And I think those qualifications

38
0:04:04,400 --> 0:04:10,240
are appropriate. So what are the things that sort of gives some background here? We use a

39
0:04:10,240 --> 0:04:16,240
measurement of the amount of virus of the viral load, so to speak. We look at these cycle threshold

40
0:04:16,240 --> 0:04:23,520
values when we manage a number of viral diseases. So CMB, cytomegalovirus, we use it for HIV, the

41
0:04:23,520 --> 0:04:28,880
virus that causes AIDS, we use it for hepatitis. And we're used to some degree of variability.

42
0:04:29,600 --> 0:04:33,520
We're actually careful to say, like, oh, are these, we're treading something over time,

43
0:04:33,520 --> 0:04:37,200
is that being done in the same lab, because there can be some interlab variability.

44
0:04:38,880 --> 0:04:44,880
But there's also an extra bit of variability here, right? We're used to doing blood tests,

45
0:04:44,880 --> 0:04:48,640
and someone draws a certain amount of blood, and a certain amount of blood is then put on the

46
0:04:48,640 --> 0:04:53,680
machine. But here, we're actually doing swabs. And those swabs could be taken from different

47
0:04:53,680 --> 0:04:58,320
sites. It could be one of those deep brain biopsy swabs, where it's really pushed in there,

48
0:04:58,320 --> 0:05:03,600
and it's twirled around, sort of a blind procedure. And it could be left in there for a proper,

49
0:05:03,600 --> 0:05:08,400
you know, 15 seconds, appropriate number of twists, where it could be sort of in and back out.

50
0:05:08,400 --> 0:05:14,800
It could be taken from the front, sort of just inside the nose, 15 seconds each side,

51
0:05:14,800 --> 0:05:20,400
making sure you get a good sample, or not, right? It's operator-dependent. It could be actually a

52
0:05:20,400 --> 0:05:26,400
swab from the mouth, or even the back of the throat. So the collection can actually affect

53
0:05:26,400 --> 0:05:31,040
these things. And we know a few things. We know that you tend to get the highest amount of virus,

54
0:05:31,040 --> 0:05:37,120
if you swab deep in that middle-terminate swab, the NP swab that we started with. If you do the

55
0:05:37,120 --> 0:05:42,640
front of the nose, it comes up about three cycles later, right? So about a 10-fold difference.

56
0:05:43,520 --> 0:05:48,880
If you do it in the mouth, it's actually about 10 cycles different. So, you know, there's a lot

57
0:05:48,880 --> 0:05:54,080
of caveats, and we're going to have to do a little bit here to make sure we interpret that. But at

58
0:05:54,080 --> 0:05:59,920
the ends of the spectrum, I think we can make sense of this. You know, if you get the report

59
0:05:59,920 --> 0:06:07,520
that that CT value is less than 24, that you're translating that into millions of RNA copy numbers,

60
0:06:08,240 --> 0:06:12,240
you're probably dealing with someone in that height of infection. You're probably dealing

61
0:06:12,240 --> 0:06:17,680
with someone who's very infectious. This is someone rush home. Don't pass go. Don't go get

62
0:06:17,680 --> 0:06:23,200
those groceries. You can order them. And at the other end of the spectrum, let's say it comes up

63
0:06:23,200 --> 0:06:30,640
37, 38, so past 36. And then we want to ask a few more questions. Was it collected properly?

64
0:06:30,640 --> 0:06:36,800
Where was it from? Because here we want to calculate, is this, you know, due to poor sample procurement,

65
0:06:36,800 --> 0:06:41,520
or is it actually really that they're kind of either the tail end of illness or right in the

66
0:06:41,520 --> 0:06:47,360
beginning? So, you know, the ends of the spectrum, I think we can really work with this. You know,

67
0:06:47,360 --> 0:06:50,800
there's going to be gray areas in the middle. It comes up at about 30. That might be a little

68
0:06:50,800 --> 0:06:57,040
harder to interpret. But for us as clinicians, this is helpful. I had a case, well, I have a case,

69
0:06:57,040 --> 0:07:01,680
gentleman, a gentleman from Nigeria, right? One of the few people who actually appreciates

70
0:07:01,680 --> 0:07:05,520
that I own cows, right? So I showed him a couple of cows, and then he wanted to know how many

71
0:07:05,520 --> 0:07:14,000
wives I had so. And he had actually been sick really for several weeks, right? Two plus weeks.

72
0:07:14,000 --> 0:07:18,400
And, you know, first he tried azithromycin, and then he tried bactrum, and then he wasn't

73
0:07:18,400 --> 0:07:23,920
getting better and ended up in the hospital. And, you know, his first test was negative. But it

74
0:07:23,920 --> 0:07:28,720
just didn't seem right. It really seemed like this was a viral syndrome. We tested again. This

75
0:07:28,720 --> 0:07:33,520
time it was positive. So my suspicion, right, is that it's right sort of on the edge here of

76
0:07:33,520 --> 0:07:38,320
detection probably high 30. So, you know, being able to get a CT value in a context like that,

77
0:07:38,320 --> 0:07:41,520
that's actually helpful. So, oh, and by the way, just one wife.

78
0:07:41,520 --> 0:07:49,360
The CT values are going to be available for all nucleic acid tests. So not, and this is actually

79
0:07:49,360 --> 0:07:54,480
an excellent question, Vincent, not all the machines actually allow you to get those values.

80
0:07:55,120 --> 0:08:00,560
It's actually cheaper to buy a machine that just gives you a yes or no, basically just at the end

81
0:08:00,560 --> 0:08:05,760
of, we'll say 40 cycles says yes or no. The more sophisticated machines, right? Apparently,

82
0:08:05,760 --> 0:08:11,360
the ones that the Broad Institute or the ones that Fauci is using those actually give you CTs

83
0:08:11,360 --> 0:08:16,240
all the time. I hate to say we call them this gentleman, the machine that the assay was run on

84
0:08:16,240 --> 0:08:21,840
did not have access to the CT values. But again, it sort of shows you, you know, it would be great

85
0:08:21,840 --> 0:08:26,640
spend that little bit of extra money and give us something that helps us in sort of figuring this

86
0:08:26,640 --> 0:08:32,080
out. So as I mentioned, we've tried to move a little bit away from those deep NP swabs,

87
0:08:32,080 --> 0:08:38,800
the brain biopsies, but still in some settings, we're doing those NP swabs, you know, particularly

88
0:08:38,800 --> 0:08:44,560
with kids, we like to do it in the anterior inaries, particularly if you're going to be doing repeat

89
0:08:44,560 --> 0:08:48,880
testing, because, you know, the blind procedure, we've had issues with triggering migraines, with

90
0:08:48,880 --> 0:08:56,480
bleeding trauma, things like that. But actually some pretty exciting stuff here. We've really

91
0:08:56,480 --> 0:09:01,600
moved ahead with access to rapid testing. And I don't know if I mentioned last time, but some

92
0:09:01,600 --> 0:09:09,120
of our sites are doing over 6,000 tests a day. And what's, you know, when you start seeing, oh,

93
0:09:09,120 --> 0:09:16,240
five, six percent or tests are positive, we're picking up hundreds of infected people per

94
0:09:16,240 --> 0:09:21,600
site. And then we're actually getting them from spreading it to other people. So that's really

95
0:09:21,600 --> 0:09:25,920
tremendous. I have to say, I'm excited to see this happening. I mean, testing saves lives.

96
0:09:25,920 --> 0:09:34,000
As far as what tests do we have access to, the BD varitor is in reasonably good supply. We can

97
0:09:34,000 --> 0:09:39,680
get reagents, we can get access to that. We have quite a bit of the Abbott ID now machines, but I

98
0:09:39,680 --> 0:09:43,920
have to say I've talked to a lot of my colleagues who, you know, those are back ordered. It's hard

99
0:09:43,920 --> 0:09:49,280
to get those now. There's such demand. There's also some, you know, other tests that people are

100
0:09:49,280 --> 0:09:56,000
hearing about. The Abbott by neck by next now, right? That's supposed to be this $5 test. The

101
0:09:56,000 --> 0:10:01,520
government has heavily invested in that. So most of us in the say the private sector are not getting

102
0:10:01,520 --> 0:10:09,280
access to that. But now an approved at home over the counter test, no prescription needed. And I

103
0:10:09,280 --> 0:10:13,680
think that's fantastic. I don't think a doctor needs to be standing between you and your ability

104
0:10:13,680 --> 0:10:20,480
to get a COVID test. And this is by a lume. And it's a rapid antigen test. And it actually has the

105
0:10:20,480 --> 0:10:24,480
ability has like this Bluetooth connection. And it's really kind of neat. So people, you know,

106
0:10:24,480 --> 0:10:31,840
if you're not driving after this, just go ahead and Google E L L U M E COVID test. And for,

107
0:10:31,840 --> 0:10:36,080
they say $30, you're going to be able to walk into your local pharmacy. You'll, you'll get this a

108
0:10:36,080 --> 0:10:40,480
little kid. There's a video, right? So you're going to use, you need a smartphone, you know,

109
0:10:40,480 --> 0:10:44,800
but you provide that. So you go on your smartphone, you watch a little video, it shows you how to do

110
0:10:44,800 --> 0:10:50,400
this. There's a little sterile nasal swab, you're going to swab your nose. They actually say in the

111
0:10:50,400 --> 0:10:54,480
kit, it's going to be an NP. They're actually going to expect you to put that back in there. So that's

112
0:10:54,480 --> 0:11:00,240
going to be interesting to see how tolerated that is. There's a little droppers and processing fluid.

113
0:11:00,240 --> 0:11:05,920
It connects via Bluetooth to your phone. And it walks you through it and in about 15 minutes,

114
0:11:05,920 --> 0:11:13,200
you get an answer. So we're now sort of increasing the number of options and making it cheaper for

115
0:11:13,200 --> 0:11:20,480
testing in the, in the home. We talked before about the Lucia, a little battery powered molecular test.

116
0:11:20,480 --> 0:11:27,440
Now we have this hopefully soon to be available $30 over the counter antigen test. And there's

117
0:11:27,440 --> 0:11:34,560
actually some talk about the, the binacs now being an at home option as well. So we're moving in

118
0:11:34,560 --> 0:11:38,400
the right direction. We're not quite there at the price point. A lot of us are looking at, but this

119
0:11:38,400 --> 0:11:43,920
is, I think it's exciting stuff. Schools, I always got to talk about schools. Really a nice piece

120
0:11:43,920 --> 0:11:51,920
in the CDC MMWR. And this was titled estimating resource resource costs for implementation of

121
0:11:51,920 --> 0:11:59,600
CDC's recommended COVID-19 mitigation strategies in pre kindergarten through grade 12 public schools,

122
0:11:59,600 --> 0:12:05,840
United States 2020 to 21 school year. And they actually, it was really interesting. They went

123
0:12:05,840 --> 0:12:10,320
through, and you know, to point out, this is not free. If you're going to say we're going to,

124
0:12:10,320 --> 0:12:14,160
we're going to open our schools, we're going to send kids to the schools. You can't just do it

125
0:12:14,160 --> 0:12:18,160
like it's 2019. You've got to do it like we're in the middle of a pandemic if you're even going

126
0:12:18,160 --> 0:12:22,960
to consider this. And they actually went through and they found and made estimates. You need to

127
0:12:22,960 --> 0:12:30,320
invest an average of $55 per student, sort of minimum. But then it goes up to about $440,

128
0:12:31,280 --> 0:12:37,600
you know, with increased staffing, shields, mass hand sanitizer wipes, the pulse oximeters,

129
0:12:37,600 --> 0:12:43,040
signage. So there's a lot involved. This is not just you say, oh, we're sending kids back to school,

130
0:12:43,040 --> 0:12:48,880
we hear it's safe. If you're thinking about doing it, there's there are ways to approach this challenge,

131
0:12:48,880 --> 0:12:55,440
but it takes money, it takes a plan. So I always try to reinforce the point that in-person schooling

132
0:12:55,440 --> 0:13:01,040
is a goal, but you can't just jump there. You get there with education, you get there with resources,

133
0:13:01,760 --> 0:13:05,200
and you know, and financial assistance, right? We dumped a lot of money, I would say into the

134
0:13:05,200 --> 0:13:09,920
stock market. If we think we're going to send kids to school, if we think we're going to ask

135
0:13:09,920 --> 0:13:15,600
teachers to go there, then we're going to actually have to have to put the money in. And I think

136
0:13:15,600 --> 0:13:20,000
this was good analysis of schools can really understand what those costs should be. And hopefully,

137
0:13:20,000 --> 0:13:25,600
we'll say policymakers can make the decisions to make this happen, because, you know, you look

138
0:13:25,600 --> 0:13:32,000
at $440 per student, and you think about that enabling to, you know, parents to work, enabling

139
0:13:32,000 --> 0:13:40,480
that child to get the benefits of education, I'll sort of leave it there. All right, vitamin D and

140
0:13:40,480 --> 0:13:46,240
Ivermectin seems a lot to people want me to discuss this. So here's what I'm going to say.

141
0:13:46,240 --> 0:13:53,280
I'm doing a better job of remembering to take my vitamin D. And if this podcast goes viral and

142
0:13:53,280 --> 0:13:58,640
we get above 20,000 YouTube views, I promise to discuss Ivermectin next week. But we got way

143
0:13:58,640 --> 0:14:03,600
too much other stuff for today. And why do we have too much other stuff vaccines? This has been an

144
0:14:03,600 --> 0:14:11,280
exciting week for vaccines. Last week at Long Island Jewish Hospital, this is where I did my

145
0:14:11,280 --> 0:14:18,320
training, also where I see a lot of patients. The first person, an ICU nurse, received the Pfizer

146
0:14:18,320 --> 0:14:23,520
vaccine. And this was exciting, right? I mean, I think I was, you know, I'm always critical,

147
0:14:23,520 --> 0:14:27,600
right? And so I'm looking and the fact that it's an ICU nurse and not a physician, I thought that

148
0:14:27,600 --> 0:14:32,000
was pretty cool. The fact that physician was giving the vaccine seemed a little odd, because I'm not

149
0:14:32,000 --> 0:14:37,840
sure we know how to do that. That's actually nurses are much better at that. So, but somehow

150
0:14:37,840 --> 0:14:42,160
that doctor did well and the nurse claimed it didn't hurt. So we'll take your word for that.

151
0:14:43,040 --> 0:14:48,000
And there was there was the tall Irishman, Michael Dowling, the head of Northwell was there. And

152
0:14:49,040 --> 0:14:53,520
yeah, that was nice that, you know, there there's the Irish there. So, you know, we always sort of

153
0:14:53,520 --> 0:14:57,440
the side of history. So that was exciting. Were you there, Daniel? Did you go?

154
0:14:57,440 --> 0:15:00,880
No, no, you know, I actually was busy taking care of patients.

155
0:15:01,760 --> 0:15:05,520
Okay. You know, and I did make the comment like, yeah, this is great that you've got the

156
0:15:05,520 --> 0:15:08,880
media appearance. But come on, let's start pushing out the vaccine. It's here. Let's get it into

157
0:15:08,880 --> 0:15:16,400
arms. Last week was all about Pfizer. And this week, the focus changes to Moderna. And so what do we

158
0:15:16,400 --> 0:15:21,840
do about what do we know about Moderna? And as people may remember, last week, when Vincent

159
0:15:21,840 --> 0:15:30,480
wanted to start Twiv, I was like, I can't. I'm watching. It's the vote. And so I did watch it again

160
0:15:30,480 --> 0:15:34,640
today. You know, I guess I'm a, you know, if people listen to Twiv, they should have been tuned in.

161
0:15:34,640 --> 0:15:40,880
If you want to hear a bunch of really smart nerds talk about stuff, it was great. I was loving it.

162
0:15:40,880 --> 0:15:44,480
And they really, these are brilliant scientists. These are, you know, and it's not just scientists

163
0:15:44,480 --> 0:15:51,280
and people looking at, you know, the whole equity aspect, etc. And what do we know? We got efficacy

164
0:15:51,280 --> 0:15:56,480
data out of this. And it's right about, you know, the same as Pfizer. It's right about 95%

165
0:15:57,680 --> 0:16:03,360
for preventing people from getting disease. Talk a little bit about what I mean. And they

166
0:16:03,360 --> 0:16:08,880
really said it looked like it's close to 100% at preventing severe COVID-19. So I'm going to go a

167
0:16:08,880 --> 0:16:16,320
little bit into that. People also are always interested in the immunological data, I guess I'll

168
0:16:16,320 --> 0:16:22,400
say some T cell responses. So we know that we're getting great antibody responses. But they also

169
0:16:22,400 --> 0:16:29,280
commented that the CD4 positive T-rays T cell responses were strongly biased as we wanted

170
0:16:29,280 --> 0:16:35,680
towards TH1 cytokines, minimal TH2 cytokine expression. And so this is reassuring, right? Because this

171
0:16:35,680 --> 0:16:40,320
is our way to predict the future. We're going to have any issues, vaccine induced disease.

172
0:16:40,320 --> 0:16:47,200
As far as reactogenicity, hopefully our listeners remember this. This is not a side effect. This is,

173
0:16:47,200 --> 0:16:51,600
I got the vaccine. And this is, you know, evidence that my immune system is working and evidence

174
0:16:51,600 --> 0:16:56,800
that I can feel when people poke me with a needle. So it's pretty similar. The majority of people

175
0:16:56,800 --> 0:17:02,800
said, yeah, it hurt when they stuck it into my, to my deltoid, unlike the nurse who claimed

176
0:17:02,800 --> 0:17:07,760
the doctor poked her with minimal pain. You know, it's funny. The majority people,

177
0:17:07,760 --> 0:17:13,280
the two days afterwards said they feel tired. Well, it's not funny, Dr. Griffin. What was funny

178
0:17:13,280 --> 0:17:17,280
is that actually, if you ask the placebo people somewhere between a third and a half said, yeah,

179
0:17:17,280 --> 0:17:22,720
I feel tired. So just to say, I haven't gotten my vaccine yet and I feel tired. So fatigue was

180
0:17:22,720 --> 0:17:28,400
very common, but only lasting usually a day or two. Headache was reported, muscle pain,

181
0:17:28,400 --> 0:17:32,800
some joint pain, some chills, and then a minority of people had fever. But again,

182
0:17:32,800 --> 0:17:39,760
this was more after the second dose than the first dose. And interesting enough, the older you are,

183
0:17:40,480 --> 0:17:46,480
the less you complain, the less reported side effects. And this seemed very similar when I went

184
0:17:46,480 --> 0:17:52,480
through the numbers with Pfizer. What came up a bit in the discussion today was the issue of

185
0:17:52,480 --> 0:17:59,600
Bell's palsy, right? There were a few cases of this in the Pfizer study. There were three cases of

186
0:17:59,600 --> 0:18:06,480
this in the mode RNA vaccine group and one in the controls. And there was a whole discussion

187
0:18:06,480 --> 0:18:11,440
about whether is that really background? Can we really say that with confidence? So that's

188
0:18:11,440 --> 0:18:17,680
something that will be being monitored. Another part of the discussion that was quite interesting

189
0:18:18,560 --> 0:18:24,800
and this will be addressed going forward was the issue about correlates of immunity. So what

190
0:18:24,800 --> 0:18:32,400
they're hoping the Moderna vaccine trial will do is actually give us the ability to do blood

191
0:18:32,400 --> 0:18:37,200
test to tell, do we have to worry about someone getting infected again? Also, it may help us with

192
0:18:37,200 --> 0:18:41,840
timing about re-vaccination. And it was a slightly different discussion than Pfizer because

193
0:18:42,720 --> 0:18:46,720
really this trial is being financed by the US government, right? This is very much under

194
0:18:47,280 --> 0:18:52,400
Operation Warp Speed. So several times they'd say, well, we are paying for this trial. So this

195
0:18:52,400 --> 0:19:00,320
is what we would like. Very interesting. But here are our vocabulary for today. So we have three

196
0:19:00,320 --> 0:19:09,120
words I want people to learn about infection, disease, and severe disease. So I'm going to throw

197
0:19:09,120 --> 0:19:13,440
in, we got a little bit of information about infection. I think this is important because

198
0:19:13,440 --> 0:19:19,040
this is going to tie in with transmission. So the end point was not whether or not people got

199
0:19:19,040 --> 0:19:23,040
infected. The secondary endpoint was not whether or not people got infected. It was whether or not

200
0:19:23,040 --> 0:19:28,080
they get disease or whether or not it was severe disease. So what's infection? Can you get infection

201
0:19:28,080 --> 0:19:32,960
without getting disease? And this is I think an important point. Our 12 listeners probably know

202
0:19:32,960 --> 0:19:37,520
this, but it's good to sort of go through. So you've got the elevator response ready to go.

203
0:19:37,520 --> 0:19:44,160
Sometimes a pathogen, a virus in this case, can actually infect us, use the same wording,

204
0:19:44,160 --> 0:19:49,040
can actually go and start replicating. But we don't know it. We have no symptoms. We have no

205
0:19:49,040 --> 0:19:55,840
fever. We have no headache. We are infected asymptomatically. The concern there is that if that

206
0:19:55,840 --> 0:20:01,040
happens, if the vaccine does not prevent that, you could have people getting infected, walking

207
0:20:01,040 --> 0:20:07,680
around feeling fine. They've got the virus replicating in their nasopharynx. They might wipe their nose,

208
0:20:07,680 --> 0:20:12,160
they might talk, they might potentially transmit it and they feel fine. They're coming to work.

209
0:20:12,160 --> 0:20:17,040
So there actually was a little bit of suggestion. Some data here was discussed on the last 12,

210
0:20:17,040 --> 0:20:22,800
if people want to listen to that, that there may actually be a protection against infection.

211
0:20:22,800 --> 0:20:28,000
And that's ideal if we're ever going to look at herd immunity. The second is disease. This is

212
0:20:28,000 --> 0:20:34,960
you get sick, right? This is a subset of infected. You have the virus doing its thing and you either

213
0:20:34,960 --> 0:20:42,080
have a sign or a symptom. Either you have a sign such as a measurable temperature, an abnormal chest

214
0:20:42,080 --> 0:20:48,160
x-ray, or you have a symptom. You feel bad. You've got a cough. And then severe disease in COVID

215
0:20:48,160 --> 0:20:53,520
really means that your oxygen level drops that you require hospitalization. And so in this study,

216
0:20:53,520 --> 0:21:00,400
we saw some preliminary suggestion that there may be a decrease in infection. We saw some really

217
0:21:00,400 --> 0:21:06,640
compelling evidence of about a 95% reduction in disease. And we saw what looks like close to 100%

218
0:21:07,440 --> 0:21:13,920
protection against severe disease. So this is exciting. And they actually talked about moving

219
0:21:13,920 --> 0:21:17,680
forward. They're planning. They talked about this at the beginning today. They're planning a

220
0:21:17,680 --> 0:21:24,960
transmission study with the mode RNA vaccine this fall at university campuses, which I thought was

221
0:21:24,960 --> 0:21:29,120
really interesting. So they're going to take a campus. These will be individuals who maybe have

222
0:21:29,120 --> 0:21:33,280
not been vaccinated yet. And they're going to have half of them get vaccinated. Half of them

223
0:21:33,280 --> 0:21:38,880
not get vaccinated. We blind it all the rest. And they're going to do really close contact tracing.

224
0:21:38,880 --> 0:21:45,200
And they're also going to do repeated swaps looking at levels of virus. So very important

225
0:21:45,200 --> 0:21:49,760
questions when we talk about herd immunity. Because if a vaccine protects you against disease,

226
0:21:49,760 --> 0:21:54,480
but not infection, if it doesn't knock down levels and interrupt transmission,

227
0:21:54,480 --> 0:21:58,320
then we really have to step back. We talk about herd immunity.

228
0:21:58,320 --> 0:22:04,800
Daniel, what was the percentage in the prevention of asymptomatic infection? You didn't give us that.

229
0:22:04,800 --> 0:22:10,720
You gave us the disease. I know. I believe it was 67%. Is that correct? Am I remembering that?

230
0:22:10,720 --> 0:22:15,680
Yeah. So it's not great, right? So a lot of people are still going to not be protected from

231
0:22:15,680 --> 0:22:23,440
infection, right? Yeah. And I think actually, I'm glad you, you know, so 67%. That's a problem.

232
0:22:23,440 --> 0:22:29,120
Because if if it's only 67% and it's a binary system, is that enough to get us herd immunity,

233
0:22:29,120 --> 0:22:33,520
right? If you say, OK, 100% of the population agrees to get vaccinated. I'm not sure what planet

234
0:22:33,520 --> 0:22:41,280
that occurs on. And it's 67% effective at blocking infection. That's like right at the edge of

235
0:22:41,280 --> 0:22:46,480
giving us herd immunity. You drop down to 90% and you're probably below herd immunity. So this

236
0:22:46,480 --> 0:22:51,440
is a problem. And I think maybe sort of, you know, and the transmission research is so important,

237
0:22:51,440 --> 0:22:55,520
because infection is one thing. But let's say you get infected, but it's at such a low level

238
0:22:55,520 --> 0:22:59,920
you can't transmit. That's OK. And so I think that's what we'll get. Hopefully this fall.

239
0:23:01,120 --> 0:23:04,000
No, it's actually people probably wanted to know that 67. So thank you.

240
0:23:04,880 --> 0:23:09,520
All right. So we're getting lots of questions, right? The vaccines are out there. First question

241
0:23:09,520 --> 0:23:15,280
I always get is Dr. Griffin, which is better. Is it Pfizer or Moderna? And we were joking about

242
0:23:15,280 --> 0:23:18,880
this because, you know, saying, well, you know, it's kind of like the Android phone versus the,

243
0:23:18,880 --> 0:23:23,600
you know, Apple iPhone, which one I get. I said, kind of like the Moderna, right? I think it's got

244
0:23:23,600 --> 0:23:27,680
sort of nicer packaging, you know, the way Apple does that thing. And I said, but you know, to be

245
0:23:27,680 --> 0:23:30,800
honest, if someone called me right now and said, Hey, Dr. Griffin, we've got your Pfizer

246
0:23:30,800 --> 0:23:35,120
dose come running down. And I was like, yeah, probably just go get it. And so, and of course,

247
0:23:35,120 --> 0:23:38,800
that day, like I got the call like, Hey, you know, Dr. Griffin, you want to schedule your Pfizer

248
0:23:38,800 --> 0:23:45,040
vaccine as a guest. So I think the data is pretty compelling. You know, they're very, very similar

249
0:23:45,040 --> 0:23:51,280
as far as efficacy as far as safety. So I, I think when you get your golden ticket, as we say,

250
0:23:51,280 --> 0:23:57,520
the doctors are nurses and staff are getting their vaccines. I go ahead, take the opportunity

251
0:23:57,520 --> 0:24:04,880
to get the vaccine. What about pregnant or breastfeeding? And this is, you know, this is an

252
0:24:04,880 --> 0:24:09,440
E way. It's not a fully FDA approved vaccine. So I don't think we should be fighting with

253
0:24:09,440 --> 0:24:15,680
anti-vaxxers. And the anti-vaxxers shouldn't be fighting with anyone at this point. We have not

254
0:24:15,680 --> 0:24:22,320
tested this vaccine technology in pregnant or breastfeeding women, you know, humans, or even

255
0:24:22,320 --> 0:24:27,600
animals for that for that matter. So it's unknown. There's there's no mechanism to think this is

256
0:24:27,600 --> 0:24:30,880
an issue. There's no signal to think this is an issue. As we talked about last time,

257
0:24:30,880 --> 0:24:38,400
the, the scientific advisory board and the FDA has made it really clear. This is a woman's decision.

258
0:24:38,400 --> 0:24:43,840
This is not a man's decision. It's not the FDA's decision. The information is there,

259
0:24:43,840 --> 0:24:49,360
and women have the ability to make this choice. And as we move forward, we're going to learn more.

260
0:24:49,360 --> 0:24:53,280
So if you're, you know, if you're an ICU nurse and you're, you're involved in people getting

261
0:24:53,280 --> 0:24:58,720
intubated and you're in high risk, or maybe you work in an ER or an urgent care, you may decide

262
0:24:58,720 --> 0:25:04,160
I want to, I want to go right now. And, or you may decide, you know, hey, I'm, I'm doing more

263
0:25:04,160 --> 0:25:08,560
administrative stuff. I have limited patient contact. You may decide you want to wait a little bit. So

264
0:25:09,280 --> 0:25:14,320
again, we, that's, that's what we have. And people are, I think it's important that we respect

265
0:25:14,320 --> 0:25:20,800
people's decisions here. What about autoimmune disease? We have seen no signal suggesting there's

266
0:25:20,800 --> 0:25:27,200
a problem here. So again, the encouragement is, it seems, you know, that, that the scientific

267
0:25:27,200 --> 0:25:34,000
evidence and totality favors vaccinating, getting vaccinated. What if I previously got infected?

268
0:25:34,640 --> 0:25:38,480
I'm going to talk about that a little bit, but I think it was very clear in the discussion

269
0:25:38,480 --> 0:25:43,920
today by the independent scientific advisory board. I just sort of to quote, is we know people get

270
0:25:43,920 --> 0:25:48,640
reinfected. We sometimes see the reinfection is worse than the primary infection.

271
0:25:50,080 --> 0:25:55,520
We actually had people get a mild case and then die the second time. So the encouragement was

272
0:25:55,520 --> 0:26:00,640
that you should go ahead and get vaccinated. We have no, no correlates of immunity. There's no

273
0:26:00,640 --> 0:26:05,600
blood tests that we can do right now to tell you you're going to be okay. What about distribution?

274
0:26:05,600 --> 0:26:12,480
I was asked about this. Right now we still don't have as much product as demand. But that's going

275
0:26:12,480 --> 0:26:18,240
to, we expect to quickly change, particularly, it sounds like we'll have six million doses of

276
0:26:18,800 --> 0:26:24,160
Moderna or mode RNA vaccine coming out next week and other three million of Pfizer will ship.

277
0:26:24,160 --> 0:26:28,720
And so I think that I think pretty soon we're going to get to the point where we can meet that

278
0:26:28,720 --> 0:26:32,560
demand. And there's really a lot of people, as I mentioned, all hands on deck to try to make this

279
0:26:32,560 --> 0:26:37,920
happen. As there have been some reports, I think three allergic reactions to the Pfizer vaccine.

280
0:26:37,920 --> 0:26:43,520
Can you illuminate? Yeah. So the one in the US, I think that got a little bit of press as they

281
0:26:43,520 --> 0:26:49,520
gave it to an individual up in Alaska, right? And there were a couple in the UK that early on.

282
0:26:49,520 --> 0:26:55,200
So there is that that warning that we say that if you have had a previous

283
0:26:55,200 --> 0:27:00,640
anaphylactic reaction to a vaccine, you should speak to your physician,

284
0:27:00,640 --> 0:27:06,080
consider premedication, don't just sort of run in there and get the vaccine. And I think that's

285
0:27:06,080 --> 0:27:11,760
the important. It is a previous severe reaction to a vaccine. It's not egg allergy. It's not,

286
0:27:11,760 --> 0:27:16,640
I have issues with pollen. It's not peanuts. It's not an antibiotic issue. It's just, you know,

287
0:27:16,640 --> 0:27:20,960
and that's the question. Have you had a previous severe reaction to a vaccine? If the answer is no,

288
0:27:21,600 --> 0:27:26,000
you can move ahead. After you get a vaccine, you shouldn't you be observed for 15 minutes to make

289
0:27:26,000 --> 0:27:31,120
sure nothing happens? Yeah, they've actually extended it in a lot of the places here to 30

290
0:27:31,120 --> 0:27:37,360
minutes. But the recommendation is observation for a minimum of 15 minutes. And as we learn more,

291
0:27:37,360 --> 0:27:48,560
we'll see. But yeah, that's recommended. The two shots, right? So the Pfizer-BioNTech is a 0.3 milliliter

292
0:27:48,560 --> 0:27:55,600
shot, given 21 days apart, you get a second shot. So it's two shots. Interesting thing people have

293
0:27:55,600 --> 0:28:00,400
probably heard about is, Oh my gosh, there's more doses in that vial than we knew. So I'll

294
0:28:00,400 --> 0:28:05,040
talk a little bit about that. I was asked one of our pharmacists who's been actually reconstituting

295
0:28:05,040 --> 0:28:11,920
this today. And these vials, when you actually thought of there's about 0.2 milliliters of

296
0:28:11,920 --> 0:28:16,320
liquid in there about 0.2, right? So there's a certain amount of the product in there,

297
0:28:16,320 --> 0:28:21,920
and there's a certain amount of volume that that comes up. You add 1.8 milliliters,

298
0:28:21,920 --> 0:28:26,800
you can do the math. That gives you about two milliliters. They're always slightly overfilled.

299
0:28:27,600 --> 0:28:32,240
So you say, well, I'm going to do the math in my head here, Dr. Griffin, 0.3 times 5, 1.5,

300
0:28:32,240 --> 0:28:37,920
that leaves half a milliliter of fluid in every vial or so. And that's what was actually noticed.

301
0:28:38,960 --> 0:28:43,440
So Pfizer was alerted. Pfizer said, listen, we're not going to give any specific recommendation,

302
0:28:43,440 --> 0:28:48,480
but your hospital might make a decision about this. And what a lot of the hospitals have done,

303
0:28:48,480 --> 0:28:54,080
and the health care system where I'm working, has actually said they will draw an extra dose

304
0:28:54,080 --> 0:28:58,160
out of that vial, if possible, if there's an extra 0.3 in there, which there always is.

305
0:28:58,160 --> 0:29:06,400
And sometimes there's even another dose in there, because we say about 0.2. So sometimes it's

306
0:29:06,400 --> 0:29:12,560
about 2.1 at the end. But they do say, don't draw a little bit out of 1, a little bit out of another

307
0:29:12,560 --> 0:29:20,000
worried about cross-contamination infection risks. But that's the mystery there. The Moderna is

308
0:29:20,000 --> 0:29:24,880
actually a slightly larger volume. And we've always talked about from a nursing point. We have to

309
0:29:24,880 --> 0:29:30,800
be careful that people are just sort of straight with how much they draw. So the Moderna is 0.5 ml,

310
0:29:30,800 --> 0:29:37,280
so it's a little bit larger amount that goes in. Again, two shots, about 28 days apart. And then I

311
0:29:37,280 --> 0:29:42,720
guess just to wrap that off, Pfizer is being sent around in those cool thermal shippers.

312
0:29:42,720 --> 0:29:47,360
They monitor until they arrive and then switches over, someone else monitors it. So they can

313
0:29:47,360 --> 0:29:50,640
actually be kept in those thermal shippers. So we're not going to necessarily need everyone in

314
0:29:50,640 --> 0:29:56,320
the world to have an ultra cold. Moderna can be shipped around at negative 20 and then kept in

315
0:29:56,320 --> 0:30:01,680
a fridge. We think it's going to be for about a month. So good stuff there on excess and getting

316
0:30:01,680 --> 0:30:08,560
it around. All right, incubation period. I want to make sure I hit this. Remember, a test does not

317
0:30:08,560 --> 0:30:14,000
predict the future. Just on the phone again with a dad who said, you know, his one son got sick,

318
0:30:14,000 --> 0:30:21,760
tested positive, isolated for his 10 days. You know, he and the other boys had a test a couple

319
0:30:21,760 --> 0:30:26,400
days after the first son tested positive. So, you know, his comment was, we should be all good to

320
0:30:26,400 --> 0:30:31,280
go. And it's like, actually, your last contact was, you know, 10 days ago. So you're still within

321
0:30:31,280 --> 0:30:37,200
the 14 day quarantine. That test a couple days after your son got sick, that doesn't quite work.

322
0:30:38,080 --> 0:30:43,120
Naturally, a CDC has said you can finish that quarantine at day seven with a negative test

323
0:30:43,120 --> 0:30:49,680
within 40 hours. New York State's still sticking with its 14 day quarantine. And I have to say,

324
0:30:49,680 --> 0:30:54,240
we're being really strict. I got, you know, another call from the NHL with it was this,

325
0:30:55,200 --> 0:30:59,840
this, you know, question about, you know, do they have to be PCR negative? Or can we switch over

326
0:30:59,840 --> 0:31:05,120
to this 10 days 21 days? And I know if people are familiar with this, but in youth hockey,

327
0:31:05,120 --> 0:31:10,160
something about the dynamic of the ice makes it the highest risk situation for transmission

328
0:31:10,160 --> 0:31:15,040
of virus from one person to another in a sporting context. So still sticking with a

329
0:31:15,920 --> 0:31:22,560
really strict no tolerance policy for professional hockey. So expect another great season next year.

330
0:31:22,560 --> 0:31:28,000
Period of detectable viral replication. Here I'm going to talk about the other type of vaccination,

331
0:31:28,000 --> 0:31:33,120
passive vaccination, right? And this is the type of vaccine that the president, Ben Carson,

332
0:31:34,080 --> 0:31:39,440
Chris Christie, Rudy Giuliani, and now many, many other people are getting. And I'm now starting

333
0:31:39,440 --> 0:31:44,880
to see a significant number of people who go for this. Some of them end up in the hospital,

334
0:31:44,880 --> 0:31:51,040
right? This is not 100%. First person I saw was a gentleman, right? Got it on day four,

335
0:31:51,040 --> 0:31:56,000
two days later, felt great. Another gentleman got it on day nine. Didn't really notice much,

336
0:31:56,000 --> 0:32:02,240
ended up in the hospital. But we're seeing a lot of people get this. The earlier they get it seems

337
0:32:02,240 --> 0:32:07,920
to be consistent with what we knew from before. The suggestion is, if you get these monoconal

338
0:32:07,920 --> 0:32:14,640
antibodies within the first week, there's about a 70% reduction in progressing to hospitalization.

339
0:32:15,440 --> 0:32:23,120
The U.S. government is actually distributing 65,000 doses every week. But only about 20% of

340
0:32:23,120 --> 0:32:28,400
them are getting used. So there's a problem here. Hopefully people are listening to this.

341
0:32:28,400 --> 0:32:35,360
Let's get the word out. So the BAM linibimab, the BAM BAM, is really widely available. But

342
0:32:35,360 --> 0:32:39,040
people don't know about it, actually, to the point where even people that don't qualify

343
0:32:39,760 --> 0:32:43,040
are actually getting it through a lottery system because the hospitals are sitting

344
0:32:43,040 --> 0:32:48,720
with these vials not being used. So Eli Lilly has a place. You could actually go to the Eli Lilly

345
0:32:48,720 --> 0:32:54,160
page. And there's numbers. And actually here in New York, I get lots of calls. I send them the

346
0:32:54,160 --> 0:32:59,760
hotline. There's a hotline you call. I just had another patient today, actually a fellow clinician,

347
0:32:59,760 --> 0:33:05,840
elderly gentleman or senior gentleman. I don't know if elderly is the right word, but an older adult above 65.

348
0:33:05,840 --> 0:33:11,920
And he was being arranged to get the BAM linibimab in fusion today. So this is one of those tools.

349
0:33:11,920 --> 0:33:18,640
This does have some data behind it. And as people may know, I'm working on a trial, a post-EUA

350
0:33:18,640 --> 0:33:24,640
trial to really get solid data. This is still EUA based on phase one, too. We're hoping to get

351
0:33:24,640 --> 0:33:32,640
more solid data to move forward with this. What about reinfection? So I wanted to ask this question.

352
0:33:32,640 --> 0:33:36,640
I wanted to say, OK, so what about reinfection? And what I wanted to really be curious about,

353
0:33:36,640 --> 0:33:42,560
do people get reinfected and potentially shed it to others? So we now have a lot of cases

354
0:33:42,560 --> 0:33:46,880
in the literature of really well-documented reinfection. So what I wanted two things.

355
0:33:46,880 --> 0:33:51,600
I wanted them to be young. I wanted them to be in their 20s with no medical problems.

356
0:33:51,600 --> 0:33:55,600
And two, I wanted them to be health care workers. So I wanted them to be in a situation where,

357
0:33:55,600 --> 0:34:00,240
potentially, they got it. They got it again. And they also, you're ready. My last was,

358
0:34:00,240 --> 0:34:04,480
I wanted CT values. I wanted to know, did they have enough virus that I would be concerned that

359
0:34:04,480 --> 0:34:10,880
they would transmit? So I found a nice article by Gupta V et al, asymptomatic reinfection in

360
0:34:10,880 --> 0:34:18,400
two health care workers from India with genetically distinct SARS-CoV-2. One was a 25-year-old man,

361
0:34:18,400 --> 0:34:25,760
PCR positive 5th of May, 2020. CT value at the time 36, right? So a few thousand bits of RNA when

362
0:34:25,760 --> 0:34:33,440
he's initially diagnosed. They isolate him. They wait till his PCR is negative. They get him back

363
0:34:33,440 --> 0:34:42,000
at work. August 17th. Now he's got a positive PCR with a CT value of 16.6. So that would be

364
0:34:42,000 --> 0:34:46,480
millions and millions of RNA copy numbers. So something we would think that we'd be worried

365
0:34:46,480 --> 0:34:53,280
about for transmission. Other 28-year-old woman found PCR positive also back in May. CT value

366
0:34:53,280 --> 0:35:01,840
at that point in the 20s. She did the institution. She became PCR negative. September 5th. CT value

367
0:35:01,840 --> 0:35:09,520
of 16.9. So again, very high levels of RNA. So this raises the couple issues that we got back

368
0:35:09,520 --> 0:35:15,760
to with our vocabulary. This was an issue of reinfection. They were asymptomatic. So there was no disease.

369
0:35:15,760 --> 0:35:20,160
There was no severe disease. But they had really high levels suggesting potential

370
0:35:21,040 --> 0:35:29,200
for transmission in these settings. Early inflammatory phase. I want to reinforce the timing of steroids.

371
0:35:29,200 --> 0:35:33,920
I got to call the other day. It was like, Dad, the steroids here to be doing really well for our

372
0:35:33,920 --> 0:35:38,000
patients in the hospital. I got a person who just got COVID. Should I call in a script for steroids?

373
0:35:38,000 --> 0:35:43,520
Steroids are the second week. They're in select individuals who are hypoxic, who are starting to

374
0:35:43,520 --> 0:35:50,560
develop more significant disease. They're not for everyone. It's not COVID steroids. It's just

375
0:35:50,560 --> 0:35:56,480
select people. It's a select dose. A little judgment here. Secondary infection phase.

376
0:35:57,280 --> 0:36:03,280
We talked a little bit about the ferritin procalcitonin ratio. But I want to point out that the timing

377
0:36:03,280 --> 0:36:10,320
seems to me to be the most helpful. I just had a woman today. Procalcitonin was less than 0.05.

378
0:36:10,320 --> 0:36:16,240
The FPR, the ferritin procalcitonin ratio, was super high, suggesting not bacterial.

379
0:36:16,880 --> 0:36:21,600
But she had staph aureus in the blood. Why can't it went up? She wasn't looking right.

380
0:36:22,480 --> 0:36:27,120
So I still find that you want to be vigilant. You want to understand the phases of disease.

381
0:36:27,120 --> 0:36:31,840
And when something starts to change, think about the complications that happen in that phase of

382
0:36:31,840 --> 0:36:41,040
disease. The tail phase, which often ends up with the long COVID, I was actually speaking with a nurse

383
0:36:41,040 --> 0:36:47,120
this week. It's really tough. We're seeing individuals who are now six, seven, eight months out,

384
0:36:47,120 --> 0:36:52,320
really getting pretty far out from initial disease, still suffering. And some of the employers are

385
0:36:52,320 --> 0:36:57,120
starting to get tired and say, hey, what's going on here? And I think we talked about this a little

386
0:36:57,120 --> 0:37:02,720
last time. There really isn't a great chronic diagnosis here. It puts these people in a really

387
0:37:02,720 --> 0:37:10,160
tough situation. But it's very clear. COVID is not just binary. You can get sick. You can die.

388
0:37:10,160 --> 0:37:14,000
You could get sick. You could not die. And you might have prolonged suffering. You might have

389
0:37:14,000 --> 0:37:19,360
prolonged disability. So I want to leave it there. I want to thank everyone for all the hard work

390
0:37:19,360 --> 0:37:23,520
everyone's doing. Hang in there. Keep doing it. And for everybody who's been coming to parasites

391
0:37:23,520 --> 0:37:27,840
with that borders.com and helping us. That's fantastic. Thank you. We're continuing to help the

392
0:37:27,840 --> 0:37:33,680
P scores HIV and AIDS programs. Because remember, that virus has not gone away. All right, Daniel,

393
0:37:33,680 --> 0:37:40,400
a couple of quick questions. First one is Ellen from Johns Hopkins, assuming one has been vaccinated

394
0:37:40,400 --> 0:37:46,560
and then becomes infected with SARS-CoV-2. One, do we know the degree to which that person's virus

395
0:37:46,560 --> 0:37:53,680
shedding is infectious? And two, can that person become a long hauler? Oh, that was fantastic.

396
0:37:54,240 --> 0:37:59,760
Because that hits right into what we were talking about. We don't know yet. And we're going to get

397
0:37:59,760 --> 0:38:03,680
this data. This is actually the planned transmission studies that we heard about. They're going to

398
0:38:03,680 --> 0:38:08,480
be taking individuals and vaccinating, comparing them to non-vaccinated individuals. And they're

399
0:38:08,480 --> 0:38:15,520
actually going to be doing quantitative viral load testing and coupled with transmission

400
0:38:15,520 --> 0:38:19,760
contact tracing. So we're going to get answers to this. We don't know yet. And I think this is

401
0:38:19,760 --> 0:38:24,720
really critical. A lot of people I saw this early on in the pandemic, they get the COVID.

402
0:38:24,720 --> 0:38:29,360
They'd say, oh, I'm fine. The mask would be off. They would feel like they had some special

403
0:38:29,360 --> 0:38:36,480
invisible magic shield. We don't know. The vaccine may protect you from infection. We've seen

404
0:38:36,480 --> 0:38:42,960
evidence for that. It seems very compelling that it infects you from disease and severe disease.

405
0:38:42,960 --> 0:38:47,760
But we don't know. You could very well get infected. You could have high enough viral

406
0:38:47,760 --> 0:38:51,440
level that you could then infect your loved ones of your patients. So until we know that,

407
0:38:51,440 --> 0:38:54,800
you got to keep washing your hands. You got to keep wearing your mask. You got to keep acting

408
0:38:54,800 --> 0:38:59,440
like we're in the middle of a pandemic. All right. So Alan asked about allergic reactions after

409
0:38:59,440 --> 0:39:04,880
vaccination. We already covered that. So we can skip that. And then Dr. Hasanane says,

410
0:39:04,880 --> 0:39:09,760
can someone like President Trump who received monoclonal antibodies get the vaccine now?

411
0:39:09,760 --> 0:39:14,080
Or will he have antibodies that may neutralize the spike protein once formed?

412
0:39:14,080 --> 0:39:18,960
Yeah. So we think that that's a concern. And we're actually recommending that people wait

413
0:39:18,960 --> 0:39:25,040
90 days. And that's based upon, we'll say, the half-life of the monoclonal

414
0:39:25,040 --> 0:39:29,760
bammative about by Eli Lilly is 21 days. So we're waiting for that to get low enough.

415
0:39:29,760 --> 0:39:34,960
Because otherwise, the concern is you get the vaccine and you actually will not get the benefit

416
0:39:34,960 --> 0:39:40,720
of vaccination. The half-life is pretty similar for the cocktail from Regeneron. The GSK product

417
0:39:40,720 --> 0:39:44,240
hasn't made it to market yet. That doesn't even longer half-life. So that may really

418
0:39:44,240 --> 0:39:49,520
prevent you from getting active vaccination for some time. But the current recommendation is to

419
0:39:49,520 --> 0:39:57,200
wait 90 days. One more from Nicholas as a health care worker myself on the front lines every day

420
0:39:57,200 --> 0:40:01,360
who has suffered from COVID-19. What are the recommendations for vaccination? Should I move

421
0:40:01,360 --> 0:40:06,400
myself to the back of the list since I may have antibodies? Are there any concerns for

422
0:40:06,400 --> 0:40:10,640
someone to get the vaccine after having suffered from COVID-19?

423
0:40:11,600 --> 0:40:16,240
Yeah. So there's two questions here that I'll sort of tease out. One is there's no risk that

424
0:40:16,240 --> 0:40:20,480
we're aware of that a person is going to get the vaccine and have a problem because they had

425
0:40:20,480 --> 0:40:25,840
COVID before, right? And Pfizer had a number of people who had been previously infected,

426
0:40:25,840 --> 0:40:32,560
get vaccinated, the chat-ox study, the Oxford AstraZeneca also had a similar where people were

427
0:40:32,560 --> 0:40:38,560
fine to get the vaccine. The other is a prioritization issue. Should I get this? Should I wait and let

428
0:40:38,560 --> 0:40:44,240
all my colleagues get it first? The hospital's health care systems, this is a monumental challenge

429
0:40:44,240 --> 0:40:48,240
to get everyone vaccinated. I've basically been telling people if they call your number,

430
0:40:48,240 --> 0:40:52,720
if your golden ticket comes up and it's time to get vaccinated, go ahead, get vaccinated.

431
0:40:52,720 --> 0:40:57,760
Try to get all the health care workers at least their first dose this month. So just go ahead,

432
0:40:57,760 --> 0:41:02,560
keep the logistics flowing. Make sure you jump in the lifeboat before we run out type thing.

433
0:41:03,760 --> 0:41:08,400
So don't wait. Just go ahead, get vaccinated. I'm encouraging people to do that.

434
0:41:08,400 --> 0:41:14,560
That's COVID-19 clinical update number 41 with Dr. Daniel Griffin. Thank you, Daniel.

435
0:41:14,560 --> 0:41:22,880
Oh, thank you. Everyone, take care and be safe.
