0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:06,960
This week in virology, the podcast about viruses, the kind that make you sick.

2
0:00:10,400 --> 0:00:21,280
From Microbe TV, this is Twiv, this week in virology, Episode 767, recorded on June 10, 2021.

3
0:00:21,840 --> 0:00:28,160
I'm Vincent Racken Yello, and you are listening to the podcast all about viruses joining me today

4
0:00:28,160 --> 0:00:34,240
from New York, Daniel Griffin. Hello, everyone. Well, Daniel, you got another

5
0:00:34,240 --> 0:00:40,800
wide-body aircraft, 767. That's what I was hoping. So I'm happy with that. You know,

6
0:00:40,800 --> 0:00:44,000
you got to take what you can. What's the biggest aircraft do we know?

7
0:00:45,280 --> 0:00:50,480
Is it Alan? We need Alan to be known as the biggest aircraft ever. I don't know. I have no idea.

8
0:00:51,520 --> 0:00:57,040
When I was a kid, I actually flew as a kid, but I preferred gliders. I always been that like

9
0:00:57,040 --> 0:01:02,160
sailing gliders. And it's just something amazing about being up there without an engine,

10
0:01:02,160 --> 0:01:09,440
and then catching the thermals spiraling up. Gliding looks great, but I don't want to do it.

11
0:01:09,440 --> 0:01:17,040
I'm good. All right, let's start with our quotation. The idea that some lives matter less is the

12
0:01:17,040 --> 0:01:22,480
root of all that is wrong with the world. And that's Paul Farmer. I don't know if people are

13
0:01:22,480 --> 0:01:28,480
familiar with Paul Farmer. He's actually the co-founder and chief strategist of Partners in

14
0:01:28,480 --> 0:01:34,880
Health, which is a pretty significant international nonprofit organization that's existed since the

15
0:01:34,880 --> 0:01:41,840
1980s, providing health care services, but also involved in research and advocacy.

16
0:01:42,480 --> 0:01:48,400
And I have to admit, my first exposure to Paul Farmer was reading the book Mountains Beyond

17
0:01:48,400 --> 0:01:53,680
Mountains by Tracy Kitter. And that's really a must read for. I was going to say for people

18
0:01:53,680 --> 0:01:59,280
going into global health, but I'm just going to say it's a must read, just a really impressive,

19
0:01:59,280 --> 0:02:04,320
inspiring individual. And really, my wife and I were actually talking about Paul Farmer the

20
0:02:04,320 --> 0:02:11,200
other night, just about how he truly lives this message. He really treats every human being

21
0:02:12,320 --> 0:02:17,040
as if they're the most important person in the world. My wife says that she and I are a little

22
0:02:17,040 --> 0:02:23,120
too tribal. Our kids come first, and everyone else second. For Paul, I think he treats everyone

23
0:02:23,120 --> 0:02:29,120
like they're his son, his daughter. So I think as we're going into the next phase, we're going to

24
0:02:29,120 --> 0:02:37,760
have to realize that the developed nations, the nations with more resources really need to be

25
0:02:37,760 --> 0:02:44,080
there for everyone. You know, you can't have J&J vaccines expiring while people are still

26
0:02:44,080 --> 0:02:49,440
dying in many parts of the world without access. So I thought I would start with that as our quotation,

27
0:02:50,160 --> 0:02:59,120
but let me give an update. Today was a milestone at the two hospitals where I spent my

28
0:03:00,000 --> 0:03:06,720
morning, earlier part of the day, not a single COVID case, not a single active COVID case in

29
0:03:06,720 --> 0:03:12,000
either hospital. You know, over at some of the other hospitals, there are still some COVID cases,

30
0:03:12,000 --> 0:03:19,520
but boy, COVID has fallen off a cliff here in my immediate area. You know, the weather's getting

31
0:03:19,520 --> 0:03:25,040
better. There's a combination of vaccines and also boy, a bunch of people got infected already.

32
0:03:25,040 --> 0:03:30,000
So we really have things going in the right direction. And what I'm going to start with is

33
0:03:30,000 --> 0:03:36,800
actually we have learned a lot. So we have a lot of evidence based recommendations now, which

34
0:03:36,800 --> 0:03:41,520
really makes my world a lot better. So I was just going to start with sort of the executive

35
0:03:41,520 --> 0:03:47,040
summary of the ID Society of America's guidelines, just what they're recommending for and against,

36
0:03:47,040 --> 0:03:52,400
but I'm going to give a little context. So there's there's 19 recommendations, some of them are kind

37
0:03:52,400 --> 0:03:58,560
of, you know, combinations, so to speak. So recommendation number one, hydroxychloroquine

38
0:03:58,560 --> 0:04:07,680
against recommendation to hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin also against not using

39
0:04:07,680 --> 0:04:14,320
lopinovir azithromycin, not using lopinovir ritonovir. The next recommendation four and five

40
0:04:14,320 --> 0:04:22,880
dexamethasone, not in the outpatient, but recommended in the inpatient setting if a person has a

41
0:04:22,880 --> 0:04:30,800
oxygen saturation less than 94%. Recommendation seven for those hospitalized patients with

42
0:04:30,800 --> 0:04:37,760
progressive severe COVID-19 with elevated markers of systemic inflammation, escalation in that

43
0:04:37,760 --> 0:04:44,400
oxygen requirement, suggesting the use of toselism map, right, the IL six receptor blocker among

44
0:04:44,400 --> 0:04:51,760
patients hospitalized with COVID-19 recommending against convalescent plasma. As far as the ambulatory

45
0:04:51,760 --> 0:04:58,320
patients want to get some more studies on that, but not not just doing it as a standard remdesivir

46
0:04:58,320 --> 0:05:05,360
falling into that same criteria, the hospitalized patient less than 94%. But if that patient actually

47
0:05:05,360 --> 0:05:11,360
is more severe, invasive ventilation recommending against it, people actually do worse. So timing

48
0:05:11,360 --> 0:05:19,440
current theme really matters here and recommending five days, not 10. So five days across the board,

49
0:05:19,440 --> 0:05:25,920
if you're going to be using remdesivir, again, only in the right patient jumping to femotidine,

50
0:05:25,920 --> 0:05:31,920
pepsid, you know, those antacids that are going to cure your COVID recommending against

51
0:05:31,920 --> 0:05:39,360
femotidine, then we get into our monoclonals. And actually now the ID Society of America

52
0:05:40,080 --> 0:05:44,320
is recommending they've been doing this for a little while, but they are recommending using

53
0:05:44,320 --> 0:05:50,400
combination monoclonals, such as the BAM, BAM, a testament map in areas with appropriate

54
0:05:50,400 --> 0:05:58,000
susceptibilities, or the Regeneron Cocktail, Cassie M. Devamap, but not monotherapy with BAM

55
0:05:58,000 --> 0:06:04,640
LIVAMap. And they haven't quite added the VRGSK monoclonal, which is our third, you know, EUA

56
0:06:04,640 --> 0:06:11,040
approach. What about barit to sit to nib, right? We haven't really talked too much about that.

57
0:06:12,000 --> 0:06:17,840
This is actually a therapy that is in there as a recommendation. But as people have probably

58
0:06:17,840 --> 0:06:23,280
noticed, it really hasn't gotten a lot of uptake, limited evidence that maybe a shortened hospital

59
0:06:23,280 --> 0:06:28,400
stay by about a day. But it's not something a lot of us are particularly comfortable using,

60
0:06:28,400 --> 0:06:33,440
but it just, I will give it some mention there. No one's complete without a mention of Ivermectin,

61
0:06:33,440 --> 0:06:38,640
right? So we are going to return to Ivermectin. But basically they're saying at this point,

62
0:06:38,640 --> 0:06:42,880
we still need clinical trials. This isn't something that should be used outside of clinical trials,

63
0:06:42,880 --> 0:06:48,960
we need those clinical trials. But we will get back to Ivermectin. Okay, children and COVID,

64
0:06:48,960 --> 0:06:54,400
as I like to say, children are at low risk, but they're not at no risk. And I think that's

65
0:06:54,400 --> 0:07:00,320
reasonable. I think that's accurate. Someone recently suggested to me that now that we're aware that

66
0:07:00,320 --> 0:07:06,640
every year, over 100 children here in the US die from flu, perhaps now people will be more

67
0:07:06,640 --> 0:07:11,120
motivated to get their children and themselves vaccinated. I'll never comprehend the lesson

68
0:07:11,120 --> 0:07:17,360
warm comments I get when I talk about children and and COVID here. But I actually, we are actually

69
0:07:17,360 --> 0:07:21,200
pointing out some things that maybe people didn't realize. I know early on people said, Oh, we've

70
0:07:21,200 --> 0:07:25,600
we've been comfortable with 100 children dying every year. I'm not comfortable with 100 children

71
0:07:25,600 --> 0:07:30,560
dying every year of the flu. And I'm certainly not comfortable with 300 to 500 children having

72
0:07:30,560 --> 0:07:35,520
died of COVID. You know, I've been working with a lot of schools, summer programs, sporting programs,

73
0:07:35,520 --> 0:07:41,760
businesses, trying to translate this science into safe mitigation practices, really for

74
0:07:42,400 --> 0:07:48,880
over a year now. And I do like to reinforce that in all these different settings where I've

75
0:07:49,440 --> 0:07:55,120
offered free advice, right? Sometimes it wasn't free actually. I think the NHL is supposed to

76
0:07:55,120 --> 0:08:00,720
send me a paycheck at some point. But we haven't had any we haven't had any transmission. This is

77
0:08:00,720 --> 0:08:04,880
something that can be done safely. But as I always point out, it's also something that can be done

78
0:08:04,880 --> 0:08:13,120
unsafely. So more from the CDC MMWR. And this article got quite a bit of press. Hospitalization

79
0:08:13,120 --> 0:08:21,920
of adolescents age 12 to 17 with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 COVID net 14 states, March 1st,

80
0:08:21,920 --> 0:08:30,160
2020, April 24, 2021. And this came out as an early release. And the authors reported that COVID-19

81
0:08:30,160 --> 0:08:37,600
adolescent hospitalization rates peaked at 2.1 per 100,000 in early January. Then we're headed

82
0:08:37,600 --> 0:08:43,920
in the right direction with this declining to 0.6 in mid March. However, in April 2021,

83
0:08:43,920 --> 0:08:51,840
the rate more than doubled up to 1.3 per 100,000. Among hospitalized adolescents, nearly one-third

84
0:08:51,840 --> 0:08:59,760
were admitted to the ICU and 5% required invasive mechanical ventilation. No associated deaths

85
0:08:59,760 --> 0:09:03,040
were reported during this period of time. A couple of things I want to say about this.

86
0:09:04,480 --> 0:09:12,240
This is accurate. What they said is true. But doubling from 0.6 per 100,000 up to 1.3 per 100,000,

87
0:09:13,360 --> 0:09:21,360
the numbers are still low. In my mind, a single preventable death or hospitalization is one too

88
0:09:21,360 --> 0:09:29,280
many. I already mentioned the comparator to the flu deaths that we see. But this continues

89
0:09:29,280 --> 0:09:34,880
to be low. And actually, it looks like it's dropping, right? Look at the number of cases.

90
0:09:35,760 --> 0:09:41,840
It's dropping all across the board. So I think we've learned that the fact that masks and

91
0:09:41,840 --> 0:09:47,280
social isolation and many other aspects of the pandemic have had a very negative impact on our

92
0:09:47,280 --> 0:09:53,920
children. So a lot of discussion now and reasonable about moving forward now that the rates are

93
0:09:53,920 --> 0:10:00,800
very low in a lot of our populations and also that we're rolling out expanding our vaccination

94
0:10:00,800 --> 0:10:06,320
effort. So I want to say things look good relative to our children. Things look really good relative

95
0:10:06,320 --> 0:10:12,960
to the summer and next fall. Pre-exposure period transmission. This remains a hot topic.

96
0:10:14,320 --> 0:10:20,640
I think rightfully so. I recently was emailing a bit with Michael Mena. I think some of our

97
0:10:20,640 --> 0:10:27,040
listeners know him of the liquor stick and just talking about how, for science communication,

98
0:10:27,040 --> 0:10:35,040
the concept of aerosol and airborne has been quite difficult. We say, hey, one in 10,000 cases are

99
0:10:35,920 --> 0:10:41,520
attributable to contact. So oh my gosh, that means COVID is contact transmission. Well,

100
0:10:41,520 --> 0:10:47,120
it is, but it is usually not in that situation. We've talked about the number of cases that occur

101
0:10:47,120 --> 0:10:52,400
within the three to six feet in close contact. But we've also clearly discussed that there are

102
0:10:52,400 --> 0:10:57,200
a number of cases that occur even when you're outside those six feet. And we've talked about

103
0:10:57,200 --> 0:11:03,680
the role of ventilation improvements where you're clearly beyond that six feet, improving the risk

104
0:11:03,680 --> 0:11:10,400
reducing the risk of transmission. So hopefully we will get a little better, better language that

105
0:11:10,400 --> 0:11:14,640
we will have less confusion and controversy and we can really focus on what's important,

106
0:11:14,640 --> 0:11:19,600
which is keeping people safe and communicating the essential messages on how to do that.

107
0:11:19,600 --> 0:11:23,520
Why are we talking about Michael Mena? He actually just published another paper.

108
0:11:24,400 --> 0:11:29,840
And this was out of his group estimating epidemiological dynamics from cross-sectional

109
0:11:29,840 --> 0:11:36,720
viral load distributions. And this was published in science. And the authors suggest that the

110
0:11:36,720 --> 0:11:43,840
population distribution of viral loads observed in the form of CT values, right, the cycle threshold

111
0:11:43,840 --> 0:11:53,120
values that you get from the ECR testing actually changes during a pandemic. And they argue that the

112
0:11:53,120 --> 0:12:00,320
CT values, even from limited numbers of random samples, can provide estimates of an epidemic's

113
0:12:00,320 --> 0:12:03,920
trajectory, right? So they're trying to say, this might be a tool we can use.

114
0:12:04,800 --> 0:12:09,440
Should we see the next pandemic or even in this pandemic? They go on to demonstrate that

115
0:12:09,440 --> 0:12:15,120
combining data from multiple samples can improve the precision and robustness of this estimation.

116
0:12:15,840 --> 0:12:20,800
And they looked at CT values from surveillance conducted during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic

117
0:12:20,800 --> 0:12:27,440
in a variety of settings. And they offer alternative approaches for real-time estimates

118
0:12:27,440 --> 0:12:34,320
of the epidemic trajectories for this outbreak management based on these values. What they're

119
0:12:34,320 --> 0:12:39,920
really trying to suggest is they bring up the observed CT values and the fact that they have

120
0:12:39,920 --> 0:12:47,760
varied over the course of the pandemic and saying you do not need to invoke fitness changes,

121
0:12:47,760 --> 0:12:53,680
necessarily genetic changes in the virus. There actually can be a trajectory of the pandemic.

122
0:12:53,680 --> 0:12:59,840
So this is, I have to say, it is a complicated paper, but it is worth reading. So we'll get it up

123
0:12:59,840 --> 0:13:06,000
there on our website. And I'm going to suggest again that sharing this information, I think it

124
0:13:06,000 --> 0:13:10,960
should be a standard part of every PCR report, whether it's positive or negative, but also at

125
0:13:10,960 --> 0:13:16,640
what level it's positive or negative. The more this information is out there and shared. I think

126
0:13:16,640 --> 0:13:23,280
we're all smart enough, educated enough that we can handle that information and try to make

127
0:13:23,280 --> 0:13:30,000
something of it. Active vaccination, never miss an opportunity to vaccinate and vaccines are how

128
0:13:30,000 --> 0:13:39,360
this pandemic ends. And I'm going to try to throw some stories in here. I was throwing these

129
0:13:39,360 --> 0:13:46,880
stories where a clinician has maybe not managed to patient as best as they might have. And I do

130
0:13:46,880 --> 0:13:52,160
that as a way of teaching, sort of bringing out people. So I would never do that. And hopefully

131
0:13:52,160 --> 0:13:56,720
that sticks in their minds. But I do, I get a lot of communication from a lot of really,

132
0:13:56,720 --> 0:14:02,400
I'm going to say really, really at really hardworking primary care clinicians across the country

133
0:14:03,040 --> 0:14:08,800
that are not making these mistakes. So I really apply this has been a really tough 18 months and

134
0:14:08,800 --> 0:14:13,600
a lot of say a lot of our 12 listeners, a lot of physicians out there are really putting in

135
0:14:13,600 --> 0:14:20,000
those extra hours and staying up to date. We're still seeing these individuals come in. I just

136
0:14:20,000 --> 0:14:26,160
grabbed an individual last week. I mentioned that the two hospitals I went to today had no COVID,

137
0:14:26,160 --> 0:14:34,160
but my partner, Anujali just admitted a woman late 50s diabetic, not vaccinated. She was exposed

138
0:14:34,160 --> 0:14:41,120
because her dad was ill also in the hospital, sort of missed the window for vaccine, missed the window

139
0:14:41,120 --> 0:14:48,080
for the monoclonals. So I think that we've got to keep hammering on this. You know, this is a

140
0:14:48,080 --> 0:14:54,400
the Hail Mary as some people like to say for the unvaccinated. Let's talk about not only vaccines,

141
0:14:54,400 --> 0:15:02,000
but what about prior infection? So there was a paper incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection,

142
0:15:02,000 --> 0:15:07,520
according to baseline antibody status in staff and residents of 100 long-term care

143
0:15:07,520 --> 0:15:14,720
facilities, Vivaldi, a prospective cohort study. And this was published in the Lancet

144
0:15:14,720 --> 0:15:21,520
Healthy Longevity Journal. Now, I do not subscribe to this journal for disclosure, but perhaps I should.

145
0:15:22,240 --> 0:15:29,680
I mean, who does not want healthy longevity? But this was a prospective cohort study of SARS-CoV-2

146
0:15:29,680 --> 0:15:36,080
infection in staff less than 65 years of age. Interesting enough. And the residents were all

147
0:15:36,080 --> 0:15:43,360
over age 65. And they looked at 100 long-term care facilities in England between October 1,

148
0:15:43,360 --> 0:15:50,880
2020 and February 1, 2021. Now that sounds like a lot, right? But at the end of the day,

149
0:15:51,440 --> 0:15:56,720
they only ended up looking at 682 residents from 86 of the long-term care facilities

150
0:15:57,600 --> 0:16:04,960
and 1,429 staff members from 97 long-term care facilities, just, you know, who met criterion

151
0:16:04,960 --> 0:16:14,800
who could be included. At baseline, IgG antibodies to nuclear capsid were detected in 226 of the

152
0:16:14,800 --> 0:16:23,520
682 residents, so about a third and 408, so 29%, about a third of the 1,429 staff members.

153
0:16:23,520 --> 0:16:32,720
They then observed that 20% of the 456 residents who are antibody negative and included at baseline

154
0:16:32,720 --> 0:16:40,560
went on to have a positive PCR test compared with 2% of the 226 residents who were antibody

155
0:16:40,560 --> 0:16:48,320
positive at baseline. What about the staff? 11% of the staff that were antibody negative at the

156
0:16:48,320 --> 0:16:54,080
beginning went on to have a positive versus 2% of the staff who were antibody positive at baseline.

157
0:16:54,640 --> 0:17:01,920
So they give us adjusted hazard ratio for the serology positive residents of 0.15.

158
0:17:01,920 --> 0:17:08,480
And for staff, 0.39. Now, what were sort of the interesting things about this study?

159
0:17:09,200 --> 0:17:16,960
One was that this study had to be kind of impacted because we have the rapid rollout of vaccines

160
0:17:16,960 --> 0:17:23,280
long-term care facilities in England starting December 8th. So mixed in here is single-dose

161
0:17:23,280 --> 0:17:28,320
vaccine protection in previously infected, and then the data seems a little bit less clear.

162
0:17:28,320 --> 0:17:33,520
And this is going to bring up what I think is important challenge for us going forward,

163
0:17:33,520 --> 0:17:40,400
trying to collect data about the impact of natural infection compared to vaccines,

164
0:17:41,120 --> 0:17:47,680
and also the issue that we're going to come up to. What about variants? So there was a research

165
0:17:47,680 --> 0:17:52,960
letter that hit you with another right in here in this section, assessment of SARS-CoV-2

166
0:17:52,960 --> 0:18:01,040
reinfection in Lombardi, Italy. So now we're moving from UK to Italy. And here the authors are

167
0:18:01,040 --> 0:18:07,200
reporting on the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 primary infection and reinfection among individuals who

168
0:18:07,200 --> 0:18:14,160
during the first wave of the pandemic in Italy underwent diagnostic PCR testing. And the results

169
0:18:14,160 --> 0:18:20,720
of this study suggested that patients who had recovered from SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19 had a lower

170
0:18:20,720 --> 0:18:26,800
risk of reinfection, and there appeared to be a protective effect out to about a year.

171
0:18:27,520 --> 0:18:33,840
And the authors here did comment that this observation all ended right before we started

172
0:18:33,840 --> 0:18:40,400
to see the SARS-CoV-2 variants enter Italy. Now there's a study that actually has gotten a

173
0:18:40,400 --> 0:18:45,600
lot of attention, so we'll spend a little bit of time on this. And this was a preprint,

174
0:18:45,600 --> 0:18:52,320
so this is not peer reviewed, and it needs some peer review, necessity of COVID-19 vaccination

175
0:18:52,320 --> 0:18:58,560
in previously infected individuals. So this preprint was a study looking at employees of

176
0:18:58,560 --> 0:19:04,960
the Cleveland Clinic Health System. Now fortunately from a science standpoint, but unfortunately

177
0:19:04,960 --> 0:19:10,560
from a public health standpoint, it did not look like there was great success in terms of vaccine

178
0:19:10,560 --> 0:19:17,120
uptake. The authors reported that the majority of employees that had been previously infected

179
0:19:17,120 --> 0:19:24,000
did not get vaccinated, and only 59% of the other employees got vaccinated.

180
0:19:24,000 --> 0:19:28,480
So not a great job of employees getting vaccinated out there at the Cleveland Clinic.

181
0:19:29,200 --> 0:19:36,240
They also reported that 5% of their employees ended up getting infected with COVID-19 prior

182
0:19:36,240 --> 0:19:41,360
to the start of this study. So far, not really great stuff for the Cleveland Clinic here.

183
0:19:42,240 --> 0:19:49,200
What they did is they performed a retrospective cohort study, and what they obtained was a waiver

184
0:19:49,200 --> 0:19:53,920
of informed consent, so they did not need any of the employees to actually consent for their data

185
0:19:53,920 --> 0:19:59,600
to be used here. They got a waiver of HIPAA authorization so that these researchers could

186
0:20:00,160 --> 0:20:04,800
go ahead and access all these employees' personal health information and records.

187
0:20:04,800 --> 0:20:11,280
And then the authors compared four groups. So you have group one. These are previously infected,

188
0:20:11,280 --> 0:20:19,520
unvaccinated, previously infected, vaccinated, not previously infected, unvaccinated, and not

189
0:20:19,520 --> 0:20:24,960
previously infected, vaccinated. And then they followed these individuals over five months.

190
0:20:25,600 --> 0:20:30,400
And there's a plot. It's a Simon Makuk plot. Looks a lot like those Kaplan-Meyer curves we

191
0:20:30,400 --> 0:20:37,200
see over time, the rates of infection. And it's sort of striking to the eyes that the only area

192
0:20:37,200 --> 0:20:42,720
where you're seeing significant rates of new infection are in the not previously infected,

193
0:20:42,720 --> 0:20:48,560
unvaccinated population. Now, the authors make several allowances. They do comment that their

194
0:20:48,560 --> 0:20:56,000
results are quite a bit different from a large study out of Denmark looking at, well, actually,

195
0:20:56,000 --> 0:21:03,200
it was a population of 4 million PCR tested individuals in Denmark study. So that paper,

196
0:21:03,200 --> 0:21:08,480
assessment of protection against reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 among 4 million PCR tested

197
0:21:08,480 --> 0:21:15,680
individuals in Denmark in 2020, a population level observational study. The authors commented

198
0:21:15,680 --> 0:21:23,680
that that study suggested only about an 80.5% reduction and only a 47.1% reduction in those

199
0:21:23,680 --> 0:21:30,880
over the age of 65. So they comment that their results in this preprint are quite a bit different,

200
0:21:30,880 --> 0:21:36,800
quite a bit more rosy and encouraging than we saw in that study. Their study also was only a

201
0:21:36,800 --> 0:21:41,280
five-month follow-up, right? So we sort of have this idea that you don't test people for the first

202
0:21:41,280 --> 0:21:45,760
three. So a lot of people have asked me about, was it really just a two-month follow-up? So

203
0:21:46,400 --> 0:21:52,000
you got to look at that in terms of the numbers. And they also comment, I think this is really

204
0:21:52,000 --> 0:21:57,520
critical all across the board. It is not known how well these results will hold if or when some

205
0:21:57,520 --> 0:22:03,120
of the newer variants of concern become prominent. So we're getting, we're getting, I think,

206
0:22:03,120 --> 0:22:09,520
encouraging information, you know, which we expected about a lower risk of being infected

207
0:22:09,520 --> 0:22:14,080
if you've been infected in the past. But unfortunately, the data we're seeing now is the

208
0:22:14,080 --> 0:22:19,600
majority of infections now in the US are not with the original variant. They're with the new

209
0:22:19,600 --> 0:22:25,280
variant. So we are in that world that was discussed here of newer variants. And that's the infections

210
0:22:25,280 --> 0:22:31,200
we're seeing. It becomes a whole new question. We know the vaccines, we have better and better data

211
0:22:32,080 --> 0:22:38,640
on vaccine efficacy against variants. We do not have as great data suggesting that people with

212
0:22:38,640 --> 0:22:45,280
prior infection are going to fare well with the new variants. So I continue to recommend to my

213
0:22:45,280 --> 0:22:51,360
patients who've been previously infected that they go ahead with the vaccine. Now this is going

214
0:22:51,360 --> 0:22:56,880
to be a sort of a tricky one here. I didn't realize how complicated this was. But what do we as

215
0:22:56,880 --> 0:23:04,400
clinicians do now when people come from overseas and they got some sort of vaccine outside the US?

216
0:23:04,400 --> 0:23:12,160
How do we handle that? Well, fortunately, thanks, the CDC has given us a playbook on how to do this.

217
0:23:12,160 --> 0:23:18,720
And if you go to the CDC, they have a section where they basically talk about what to do for

218
0:23:18,720 --> 0:23:24,800
a person who received a COVID-19 vaccine outside the US. And they break this down into really, I'm

219
0:23:24,800 --> 0:23:29,840
going to say three basic categories. But this is coming up. I get calls from clinicians all the

220
0:23:29,840 --> 0:23:35,440
time. So I'm going to send them to this 12 and the answers will be here. But let's take a category

221
0:23:35,440 --> 0:23:42,800
number one. This is a person who has received all the recommended doses of a COVID-19 vaccine

222
0:23:42,800 --> 0:23:50,640
that is listed for emergency use by the WHO. What do we do? Nothing. We consider them vaccinated.

223
0:23:50,640 --> 0:23:56,000
This is not just restricted to the FDA. Three that we have. These are any of those vaccines

224
0:23:56,000 --> 0:24:03,840
on the WHO list, which I will go through scenario number two. The person has not gotten all the doses.

225
0:24:03,840 --> 0:24:11,040
But they did start on one of these series of what's considered a WHO approved vaccine.

226
0:24:11,760 --> 0:24:16,960
You go ahead in that case and just offer them to the opportunity to complete one of our FDA

227
0:24:16,960 --> 0:24:22,880
authorized COVID-19 vaccine series. So let's hit a little scenarios here. Let's say they got a

228
0:24:22,880 --> 0:24:29,600
Moderna, a Pfizer overseas. You can give them that second Moderna or Pfizer dose here in the US,

229
0:24:29,600 --> 0:24:35,840
considered completed. What if they got an AstraZeneca overseas? You can then

230
0:24:36,480 --> 0:24:42,240
give them a two dose of the mRNA or you can give them a J&J. So little subtlety there.

231
0:24:42,240 --> 0:24:48,320
What if they received a vaccine that you've never heard of that is not on the WHO list? So

232
0:24:48,320 --> 0:24:53,360
they come and they said, you know what? I got my CO vaccine, inactivated vaccine produced by

233
0:24:53,360 --> 0:25:00,160
the biotech into India. What do you do? In that case, we just go ahead. We treat them as if they

234
0:25:00,160 --> 0:25:06,720
were unvaccinated and we just recommend it going ahead with an FDA authorized COVID-19 vaccine series.

235
0:25:06,720 --> 0:25:14,000
So those are our three scenarios here. A little subtlety. You want to wait at least 28 days after

236
0:25:14,000 --> 0:25:21,520
that last dose of a vaccine that is not on the WHO list. And what are the current vaccines on

237
0:25:21,520 --> 0:25:28,880
that list as of May 13th when it was last updated? That's their Pfizer BioNTech, the AstraZeneca,

238
0:25:28,880 --> 0:25:37,440
the J&J, Moderna, Sinopharm, and Sinovac. Questions? Go to the CDC website. All right.

239
0:25:38,000 --> 0:25:43,200
The period of detectable viral replication, the viral symptom phase, the time for monitoring

240
0:25:43,200 --> 0:25:47,360
and monoclonals. And as I like to say, where you get your test is where you should be able to get

241
0:25:47,360 --> 0:25:54,960
your monoclonals. So we had some exciting news. On June 4th, Regenera announced that the FDA

242
0:25:54,960 --> 0:26:03,440
authorized lower 1,200 milligram intravenous and subcutaneous dose regen cove. So that's the

243
0:26:03,440 --> 0:26:11,360
Casa Rivemab and the MDebemab antibody cocktail to treat patients with COVID-19. And it was the

244
0:26:11,360 --> 0:26:16,320
subcutaneous part that got me the most excited because this means we can really start expanding

245
0:26:16,320 --> 0:26:22,080
access to these impressive medications. I know a lot of the hospitals are going to sort of stick

246
0:26:22,080 --> 0:26:26,480
with what they've got. A lot of them, I know in the New York area have switched over to Regeneron.

247
0:26:26,480 --> 0:26:30,560
But this is potentially a chance for those urgent care, some of those primary care sites

248
0:26:31,280 --> 0:26:36,560
to go ahead. It was a little bit harder than I wish it was. It is a smaller volume, but it's

249
0:26:36,560 --> 0:26:42,320
still four shots. But that's a lot less than having to get something out of the freezer,

250
0:26:42,320 --> 0:26:50,560
set up an IV. So I think that that's great. All right. So I'm going to throw a little story.

251
0:26:50,560 --> 0:26:56,800
I'll call this missed opportunity. And this is this is a woman that we're currently taking care of.

252
0:26:56,800 --> 0:27:01,440
I sort of alluded a woman in her late 50s, carrying a little bit of extra weight,

253
0:27:02,880 --> 0:27:08,080
diabetes, just recently diagnosed with COVID. This is not the woman admitted this morning.

254
0:27:08,080 --> 0:27:14,720
She was unvaccinated, sort of part of a group of individuals who are also unvaccinated. And that

255
0:27:14,720 --> 0:27:23,600
was the exposure. At the time of diagnosis, monoclonals were not offered. And I think I told a little bit

256
0:27:23,600 --> 0:27:30,320
about how this woman ended up doing poorly. So just kind of keep this in mind. She ended up saying,

257
0:27:30,320 --> 0:27:36,720
like, I don't want to expose my family and ended up in the hospital. Unfortunately, now she's on

258
0:27:36,720 --> 0:27:43,280
a ventilator. So just keep in mind, if you decide not to get vaccinated, you can still get monoclonals.

259
0:27:43,280 --> 0:27:49,200
An article, Co-infections, secondary infections, and antimicrobial use in patients hospitalized

260
0:27:49,200 --> 0:28:00,160
with COVID-19 during the first pandemic wave from the ISA-RIC WHO, CCP UK study. This is a multi-center

261
0:28:00,160 --> 0:28:06,400
prospective cohort study published in the Lancet Microbe. And I have to say when I read this paper,

262
0:28:06,400 --> 0:28:18,720
it made me sad. Really what they observed was that 85.2% of patients with COVID ended up receiving.

263
0:28:18,720 --> 0:28:24,720
They did not require, but they ended up receiving one or more antimicrobials, antibiotics at some

264
0:28:24,720 --> 0:28:30,000
point during their admission. And there was a lot of use of broad spectrum agents, a lot of use of

265
0:28:30,000 --> 0:28:35,200
carbapenums, rather than the carbapenum sparing alternative. So really using those top shelf

266
0:28:35,200 --> 0:28:42,880
restricted antibiotics in the context of a viral illness. All right, Ivermectin, yet another paper

267
0:28:42,880 --> 0:28:50,080
on Ivermectin. And this one was published in the journal Viruses. And this was effects of a single

268
0:28:50,080 --> 0:28:57,200
dose of Ivermectin on viral and clinical outcomes in asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects,

269
0:28:57,200 --> 0:29:04,880
a pilot clinical trial in Lebanon. This was a randomized control trial conducted in 100 asymptomatic

270
0:29:04,880 --> 0:29:12,640
subjects in Lebanon that had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, five days after having come in contact

271
0:29:12,640 --> 0:29:20,000
with a suspected or positive case. So we really had good timing here. This is looking at early

272
0:29:20,000 --> 0:29:25,440
treatment. The authors reported that at baseline, the two groups had similar viral loads as assessed

273
0:29:25,440 --> 0:29:35,760
by CT values. So 15.13 versus 14.2. The treatment group received a single dose of Ivermectin. So

274
0:29:35,760 --> 0:29:43,520
this is a single dose of Ivermectin adjusted by weight. They also received what is the standard

275
0:29:43,520 --> 0:29:50,080
of care in Lebanon, which is zinc and vitamin C as well. And the authors reported two findings.

276
0:29:50,080 --> 0:29:55,840
At 72 hours after the regimen was started, the increase in CT values was significantly higher

277
0:29:55,840 --> 0:30:03,280
in the Ivermectin than the control group. So higher CT values, lower viral load. In the Ivermectin

278
0:30:03,280 --> 0:30:10,160
group, the CT increased from 15 to 30 compared to the control group where it only went from 14

279
0:30:10,160 --> 0:30:19,200
to 18.96. Moreover, more subjects in the control group developed symptoms. 6% of the control

280
0:30:19,200 --> 0:30:24,720
population required hospitalization. Nobody in the Ivermectin treated group required hospitalization.

281
0:30:25,440 --> 0:30:31,760
So I'm going to, I'm going to muse a little bit on this here. As, and people should listen to the

282
0:30:32,320 --> 0:30:40,880
Twiv that came right before this big body airplane episode with David Fagan bomb. I mean, David,

283
0:30:40,880 --> 0:30:47,120
David's great. David's another one of these like Paul, Paul, farmer type guys who just really what,

284
0:30:47,120 --> 0:30:53,440
what a just amazing story of a man who has done so much with so many challenges. And he's really

285
0:30:53,440 --> 0:30:59,680
said, listen, Ivermectin is something that we do not know the answer to. We have some studies that

286
0:30:59,680 --> 0:31:04,480
are positive. We have some studies that are negative. We don't have enough data on Ivermectin where I

287
0:31:04,480 --> 0:31:09,760
think it's reasonable to say that, oh my gosh, withholding Ivermectin is a crime against humanity,

288
0:31:09,760 --> 0:31:14,400
a crime against humanity is that we have not done the really good trials that we need to do

289
0:31:14,400 --> 0:31:19,280
to help us in this realm. So we're all fingers crossed that active six in addition to inhaled

290
0:31:19,280 --> 0:31:25,920
steroids, fluvoxamine. Maybe Ivermectin will be in there because one of the issues is that people

291
0:31:25,920 --> 0:31:30,480
are using this widely throughout the world, probably second only to hydroxychloroquine,

292
0:31:30,480 --> 0:31:36,480
which unfortunately some people are still using and they should stop that. And we need to know

293
0:31:36,480 --> 0:31:41,360
either way with a really good trial so that clinicians patients can make decisions about

294
0:31:41,360 --> 0:31:45,040
whether or not this is something that should be included in the treatment.

295
0:31:45,680 --> 0:31:51,760
All right, early inflammatory phase. Did we talk about aspirin before? Well, aspirin,

296
0:31:51,760 --> 0:31:58,960
we finally got the recovery data on aspirin. And aspirin does not seem to be making a difference.

297
0:31:58,960 --> 0:32:04,880
So the aspirin in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 recovery, a randomized control

298
0:32:04,880 --> 0:32:10,560
open label platform trial. This was posted as a preprint. I think all our listeners are familiar

299
0:32:10,560 --> 0:32:17,120
with the big UK recovery trial. Basically, end of the day, aspirin was not associated with

300
0:32:17,120 --> 0:32:23,200
reduction in 28 day mortality or in the risk of progressing to invasive mechanical ventilation

301
0:32:23,200 --> 0:32:31,360
or death. So this is basically 150 milligrams of aspirin once per day versus standard care without

302
0:32:31,360 --> 0:32:38,960
that and not showing a benefit here. So I'm going to just close quickly with a mention of long COVID.

303
0:32:38,960 --> 0:32:44,720
We're trying to find what are the centers of excellence. We're trying to establish some

304
0:32:44,720 --> 0:32:50,640
definitions of what are excellent outcomes. So hopefully we can get patients, unfortunately,

305
0:32:50,640 --> 0:32:56,480
a growing number of patients into those centers. And we are going to continue to support femuric.

306
0:32:57,040 --> 0:33:02,240
So May, June and July, all donations made to parasites without borders will be doubled. We're

307
0:33:02,240 --> 0:33:08,800
hoping to get up to $40,000 to support femuric. So thank you very much. Time for some emails

308
0:33:08,800 --> 0:33:16,560
for Daniel. If you want to send one in, Daniel at microbe.tv. Patty writes any data and or I would

309
0:33:16,560 --> 0:33:21,840
like to know your thoughts on the effectiveness of the Pfizer COVID vaccine on patients who receive

310
0:33:21,840 --> 0:33:30,640
intravenous ocrevis to modulate multiple sclerosis symptoms. Okay, so I've actually gotten a lot

311
0:33:30,640 --> 0:33:36,400
of questions. Actually, ocrevis is one of the one of the culprits that often triggers people to

312
0:33:36,400 --> 0:33:43,360
reach out to me. And what is ocrevis for our listeners? So this is a B cell and plasma cell

313
0:33:43,360 --> 0:33:48,720
depleting therapy. So this targets CD 20. So it's going to get rid of your B cells, your plasma

314
0:33:48,720 --> 0:33:53,840
cells. Basically, you're going to get rid of those antibody producing cells really more of a B cell,

315
0:33:53,840 --> 0:33:59,120
right? You're going to lose your CD 20 when you differentiate the plasma cells. But when someone

316
0:33:59,120 --> 0:34:06,800
gets this, they have very few B cells, they get the vaccine. If you go ahead and check a anti spike

317
0:34:06,800 --> 0:34:13,120
antibody serology, it's going to be negative. Just just to just to say, the B cells are not

318
0:34:13,120 --> 0:34:18,240
there to make those antibodies. So you were relying on a T cell response. What about that T cell

319
0:34:18,240 --> 0:34:24,640
response? I heard there's a T cell test, this T detected by adaptive. The way that that is set

320
0:34:24,640 --> 0:34:31,760
up, the algorithm they use is good for detecting natural infection. It is not yet calibrated to

321
0:34:31,760 --> 0:34:37,760
give us a T cell correlate of immunity. So when these individuals, blood testing is not going to

322
0:34:37,760 --> 0:34:42,960
be helpful. We are concerned, right, that these people have gotten these therapies that they're

323
0:34:42,960 --> 0:34:48,160
not getting the B cell serology response, we hope that we're just relying on T cells.

324
0:34:48,960 --> 0:34:53,680
And we do not know the answer to this. There certainly are people out there giving extra doses

325
0:34:53,680 --> 0:34:59,200
of vaccines. I think we need to study this just like everything else. What we are not seeing,

326
0:34:59,200 --> 0:35:03,360
and I think this is reassuring, we are not seeing these patients ending up in the hospital, right?

327
0:35:03,360 --> 0:35:10,000
I'm not seeing patients who got a crevice. I'm not seeing patients on methadrexate. I'm not seeing

328
0:35:10,000 --> 0:35:16,080
lots of renal transplant or other transplant patients who got vaccinated ending up in the hospital. So

329
0:35:16,080 --> 0:35:22,400
despite a lack of this serological support, we're not seeing the breakthrough that would be as

330
0:35:22,400 --> 0:35:27,920
concerning as people might think in these populations. So I'm a bit reassured in these populations.

331
0:35:27,920 --> 0:35:32,080
I'm also reassured that the level of the virus is going down. But what is the best way to protect

332
0:35:32,080 --> 0:35:36,960
these individuals? It's for everyone else to get vaccinated. Christie from Seattle writes,

333
0:35:36,960 --> 0:35:41,840
is it possible for the COVID vaccine Pfizer to cause an allergy such as cat grass, etc.

334
0:35:41,840 --> 0:35:46,480
To develop a week after my partner got the second shot, he started getting itchy eyes and sneezing

335
0:35:46,480 --> 0:35:51,040
around our cats that we've had for three years. Obviously, there are plenty of coincidental

336
0:35:51,040 --> 0:35:56,080
conditions as you've talked about on the show, and there's still consequences far better than

337
0:35:56,080 --> 0:36:01,520
getting COVID. If possible, why would this happen? Yeah, so this one, you're going to have trouble

338
0:36:01,520 --> 0:36:05,200
doing much of a search on, right? Because everyone's all worried about the anaphylaxis.

339
0:36:06,720 --> 0:36:13,040
I am not sure that there's a relationship here. This has been a particularly bad allergy season.

340
0:36:13,040 --> 0:36:17,040
I have to say I never had allergies before this season. Oh my gosh, I just got COVID shots.

341
0:36:17,040 --> 0:36:21,200
And maybe it's no, no, I'm joking. I don't think there's a connection here. I just think this

342
0:36:21,200 --> 0:36:27,200
is a really bad allergy season. The world's in a slightly better place with how much carbon

343
0:36:27,200 --> 0:36:32,720
mitigation, how much reduction in travel and the rest. We may just be seeing lots of things blooming.

344
0:36:33,280 --> 0:36:40,080
The cat connection, I'm not sure. Joseph writes, in preparing for reopening a program for seniors,

345
0:36:40,080 --> 0:36:45,200
I was asked by my wife to review their reopening policy. Their program provides continuing educational

346
0:36:45,200 --> 0:36:52,640
and recreational programming for seniors. Their program will require COVID vaccination to attend

347
0:36:52,640 --> 0:36:57,280
the program, the average age of the participants about 80 years old. Given their age, the possible

348
0:36:57,280 --> 0:37:01,600
high risk medical conditions of these seniors, would you still recommend that the staff and

349
0:37:01,600 --> 0:37:06,960
participants still mask after vaccination? Yeah, this is a tough one. We've really doubled

350
0:37:06,960 --> 0:37:11,520
down on boy, those vaccines really make a big difference. But I think that you've got to make

351
0:37:11,520 --> 0:37:15,840
individual decisions here. If you're over 80, if you have a number of medical problems,

352
0:37:15,840 --> 0:37:21,120
I think we've talked about people on different medications. That's when if you feel comfortable

353
0:37:21,120 --> 0:37:27,280
continuing to wear a mask, it is a reasonable thing to do. We're still not through this pandemic.

354
0:37:28,000 --> 0:37:34,080
We're only learning about the impact of the vaccines on different variants. Everyone is unique,

355
0:37:34,080 --> 0:37:38,720
as far as their ability to respond to the vaccines, particularly once they get above the age of 80.

356
0:37:38,720 --> 0:37:45,520
So I see no problem continuing with masks. I point out when I go to the gym, I am a robust

357
0:37:45,520 --> 0:37:50,400
healthy individual on no medications with no medical problems in my 50s. I still wear a mask.

358
0:37:51,040 --> 0:37:54,160
I don't think there's a problem with continuing to have extra levels of safety.

359
0:37:54,160 --> 0:37:59,600
And from Stacy, I'm a psychologist in private practice. I have several patients prescribed

360
0:37:59,600 --> 0:38:06,720
either atypical antipsychotics or neuroleptic antipsychotic medication for bipolar disorder,

361
0:38:06,720 --> 0:38:11,440
schizoaffective disorder, borderline personality disorder, and schizophrenia. Their medications

362
0:38:11,440 --> 0:38:18,240
include lithium, clopazine, olanzapine, lemotrigine. Many have expressed concerns about possible

363
0:38:18,240 --> 0:38:22,560
negative interactions between the COVID vaccine and their psychiatric medication.

364
0:38:22,560 --> 0:38:27,760
Several concerns relate to possible toxicity, decrease in efficacy of psychotropics and side

365
0:38:27,760 --> 0:38:31,920
effects. One patient mentioned a fear about the COVID vaccine causing a drop in white blood cells.

366
0:38:31,920 --> 0:38:37,040
I would like to know if there is any evidence to suggest patients on psychotropic medication

367
0:38:37,040 --> 0:38:42,560
should not get vaccinated, and or what resources, research, etc. are available that I can access

368
0:38:42,560 --> 0:38:47,120
to help assure my folks that all the COVID vaccines are safe and effective for individuals

369
0:38:47,120 --> 0:38:52,640
with serious mental illness. Yeah, so I'm going to say you can feel very reassured here.

370
0:38:53,920 --> 0:38:59,360
There's a very robust reporting system, right? Hundreds of millions, over 300 million doses of

371
0:38:59,360 --> 0:39:03,520
COVID vaccines have been given in the United States. We have a robust reporting system.

372
0:39:04,160 --> 0:39:07,840
Any of the concerns, you hear about them. You hear about them in the popular press.

373
0:39:08,880 --> 0:39:15,280
We are really good at watching for these things. We are not seeing any issues in this population,

374
0:39:15,280 --> 0:39:20,000
not seeing any issues with these medications. If there's an issue, we're going to hear about it.

375
0:39:20,000 --> 0:39:25,840
Even if it's something as rare and one in 10 or 20,000, boom, we're going to see that come up on our

376
0:39:25,840 --> 0:39:31,840
adverse reporting systems. I'm going to say very comfortably that this is a safe thing to do.

377
0:39:31,840 --> 0:39:35,600
Being vaccinated is so much safer than not being vaccinated for these individuals.

378
0:39:35,600 --> 0:39:41,600
That's COVID-19 clinical update number 66 with Dr. Daniel Griffin. Thank you, Daniel.

379
0:39:41,600 --> 0:39:55,440
Oh, thank you so much, and everyone be safe.
