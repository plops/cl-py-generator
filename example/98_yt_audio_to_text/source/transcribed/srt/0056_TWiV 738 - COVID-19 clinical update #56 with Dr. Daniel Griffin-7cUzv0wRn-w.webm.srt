0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:06,960
This week in virology, the podcast about viruses, the kind that make you sick.

2
0:00:10,200 --> 0:00:13,320
From Microbe TV, this is Twiv.

3
0:00:13,320 --> 0:00:20,720
This week in virology, episode 738 recorded on April 1st, 2021.

4
0:00:21,240 --> 0:00:26,000
I'm Vincent Draconiello and you're listening to the podcast all about viruses.

5
0:00:26,000 --> 0:00:29,880
Joining me today from New York, Daniel Griffin.

6
0:00:30,520 --> 0:00:31,600
Hello, everyone.

7
0:00:32,080 --> 0:00:34,920
This is update number 56.

8
0:00:34,920 --> 0:00:37,760
What is the situation this week, Daniel?

9
0:00:38,880 --> 0:00:40,880
Um, you know, it's not good.

10
0:00:41,000 --> 0:00:43,840
Um, and, um, I'm going to go, let me just go right into that.

11
0:00:43,840 --> 0:00:45,240
And then I'll give my quotation.

12
0:00:45,240 --> 0:00:47,320
You know, so I have to say I'm getting tired.

13
0:00:47,320 --> 0:00:51,800
This has really been a tough year and it's disappointing.

14
0:00:51,880 --> 0:00:55,320
You know, we've been asking people just give us a little more time.

15
0:00:55,320 --> 0:01:00,920
Um, and Dr. J Varma, he's a senior advisor for public health at City Hall here in New York.

16
0:01:01,320 --> 0:01:02,880
Um, and I'm going to quote him.

17
0:01:03,320 --> 0:01:07,320
He said, the term I've been using is high plateau.

18
0:01:07,880 --> 0:01:10,080
Um, you know, and I think that's what this is.

19
0:01:10,080 --> 0:01:11,280
We're on this high plateau.

20
0:01:11,280 --> 0:01:12,680
The numbers are not going down.

21
0:01:12,680 --> 0:01:17,320
If anything, the numbers of new cases are climbing, a number of deaths are sitting

22
0:01:17,320 --> 0:01:19,360
at a very unacceptable high.

23
0:01:19,800 --> 0:01:21,680
Um, this, this is not good.

24
0:01:21,760 --> 0:01:24,960
Um, we, we are going to get through this.

25
0:01:24,960 --> 0:01:31,240
Um, in the United States, um, with vaccines, um, but at, I think, an unacceptable number

26
0:01:31,240 --> 0:01:38,400
of, um, of loss and unacceptable number of people sick and, uh, dead and, uh, I'm going

27
0:01:38,400 --> 0:01:40,560
to say, um, disabled after this.

28
0:01:40,560 --> 0:01:42,200
So, so not, not good.

29
0:01:42,200 --> 0:01:46,280
It's, I have to say, if you're not frustrated, if you're not upset, you're not paying attention.

30
0:01:47,160 --> 0:01:47,760
Um, all right.

31
0:01:47,760 --> 0:01:50,640
Let's go with our quotation on that wonderful positive note.

32
0:01:50,760 --> 0:01:54,760
Um, we have two lives, the one we've learned with and the one we live

33
0:01:54,760 --> 0:01:55,600
after that.

34
0:01:55,600 --> 0:01:57,760
And that's by, um, Bernard Malamut.

35
0:01:58,360 --> 0:02:03,080
Um, and I had hoped that at this point, uh, we would be past that learning stage and we would

36
0:02:03,080 --> 0:02:06,400
be moving into, um, sort of addressing this with more wisdom.

37
0:02:06,400 --> 0:02:10,840
But, um, as we're seeing people are, well, I understand I'm exhausted too.

38
0:02:10,840 --> 0:02:17,320
Um, we're tired of, uh, not hugging the ones we love, not, not doing the things we like to do.

39
0:02:17,320 --> 0:02:18,120
We're so close.

40
0:02:18,120 --> 0:02:23,320
And I have to say, um, there's been a lot of predictions, um, of the surge in the, in the fall

41
0:02:23,320 --> 0:02:28,520
and winter, which we saw, um, a little bit of a rise here in the spring, which we are now seeing,

42
0:02:29,080 --> 0:02:32,440
um, and then expecting to end up, um, in a much better place this summer.

43
0:02:32,840 --> 0:02:33,640
Um, but that's the US.

44
0:02:33,640 --> 0:02:34,760
That's for a US centric.

45
0:02:34,760 --> 0:02:37,160
I, I don't want to be so US centric.

46
0:02:37,720 --> 0:02:41,560
Um, and I'll point out the rest of the world, um, is not on the way down.

47
0:02:41,560 --> 0:02:44,920
The rest of the world, Europe even, um, is on the way up.

48
0:02:44,920 --> 0:02:46,920
So, uh, things are not looking good.

49
0:02:46,920 --> 0:02:49,240
We really need to move faster with the vaccines.

50
0:02:49,240 --> 0:02:53,240
Um, and people probably heard we had a little bit of a setback there this week.

51
0:02:53,240 --> 0:02:57,000
One of the things, um, you know, as I go through each week, I'm always trying to, uh,

52
0:02:57,000 --> 0:02:58,600
give all the new information.

53
0:02:59,080 --> 0:03:03,960
Um, but I also want to sort of always counter, you know, what people are seeing, um, you know,

54
0:03:03,960 --> 0:03:07,160
in the press, in the media with what I'm actually seeing on the ground.

55
0:03:07,720 --> 0:03:12,760
Um, and also I feel like it's important that I keep reinforcing, um, the current

56
0:03:12,760 --> 0:03:19,000
treatment approaches because I keep seeing, uh, people, um, not addressing COVID-19 based

57
0:03:19,000 --> 0:03:21,240
upon what we've learned over the, yes, last year.

58
0:03:21,240 --> 0:03:25,400
I sometimes feel like I'm, um, back in March of last year when I see, you know,

59
0:03:25,400 --> 0:03:29,480
someone show up at one of the, say, one of the non-pro-health urgent cares,

60
0:03:29,480 --> 0:03:33,720
and they get a Z-pack and, uh, and a whole bunch of steroids on the second day of illness.

61
0:03:34,360 --> 0:03:37,080
Um, so let's, let's kind of go through this.

62
0:03:37,080 --> 0:03:41,880
So, um, my section, Children and COVID, people go sort of both ways on this.

63
0:03:41,880 --> 0:03:45,560
I am glad that, um, I think I'm getting attention on this.

64
0:03:45,560 --> 0:03:51,320
I'm pointing out that, that Children are at low risk, but that they're not at no risk.

65
0:03:51,880 --> 0:03:54,600
Um, but I wanted to give some, um, perspective to this.

66
0:03:54,600 --> 0:03:58,600
I, I do try to say that it's not just about who died.

67
0:03:58,600 --> 0:04:02,680
It's not just about who ended up in the hospital, um, but let's talk about that.

68
0:04:02,680 --> 0:04:08,680
Um, Children have died here in the US from COVID-19, um, and I actually went before, um,

69
0:04:08,680 --> 0:04:13,400
doing this update, uh, to the most current CDC, um, numbers.

70
0:04:13,400 --> 0:04:18,040
Um, and I, I still remember when I first started talking about this and I was saying, listen,

71
0:04:18,040 --> 0:04:22,600
it's, it's March, um, no child under the age of seven has died of COVID.

72
0:04:23,160 --> 0:04:24,920
Um, well, that's not true anymore.

73
0:04:24,920 --> 0:04:29,080
So if you look at zero to four years in the US, over a hundred Children have died.

74
0:04:29,080 --> 0:04:34,040
Um, if you go to the next five to 17 years, over 200 have died.

75
0:04:34,040 --> 0:04:39,000
And when you go a little bit higher, so this is the 18 to 29, you know, and I have an 18-year-old,

76
0:04:39,000 --> 0:04:43,640
I have a 20-year-old over 2000 have died according to the CDC.

77
0:04:43,640 --> 0:04:45,320
Um, and that's just confirmed.

78
0:04:45,320 --> 0:04:47,000
That's just in the US.

79
0:04:47,000 --> 0:04:49,480
I want to point out, um, those are the numbers.

80
0:04:49,480 --> 0:04:51,160
Um, and that's what we're working with.

81
0:04:51,160 --> 0:04:55,400
And, um, you know, that, that's far too many deaths here in the US already.

82
0:04:55,400 --> 0:05:00,120
And what we're seeing now with the positive cases is we're seeing a shift into the younger

83
0:05:00,120 --> 0:05:00,760
population.

84
0:05:00,760 --> 0:05:06,360
We're seeing, um, as I mentioned, um, with the MISC, um, a higher percent of these

85
0:05:06,360 --> 0:05:08,840
individuals are, um, ending up in the ICU.

86
0:05:08,840 --> 0:05:13,160
One of my colleagues just reached out to me saying where they are 3% of the hospital

87
0:05:13,160 --> 0:05:15,960
admissions are now Children under the age of 18.

88
0:05:15,960 --> 0:05:19,880
This is, this is not good, but now a little bit of positive news.

89
0:05:20,760 --> 0:05:28,280
We heard a nice little, uh, press release, um, that Pfizer, um, has been testing its, um,

90
0:05:28,280 --> 0:05:31,000
vaccine on younger, um, individuals.

91
0:05:31,000 --> 0:05:35,000
And we heard some, uh, data on the 12 to 15-year-old population.

92
0:05:35,000 --> 0:05:40,840
Um, and this was, this was very impressive in participants age 12 to 15 years old.

93
0:05:40,840 --> 0:05:47,960
The Pfizer BioNTech vaccine demonstrated a hundred percent efficacy and robust antibody responses.

94
0:05:47,960 --> 0:05:54,680
Um, actually exceeding the antibody responses of older individuals, the 16 to 25-year-old,

95
0:05:54,680 --> 0:05:56,520
um, population.

96
0:05:56,520 --> 0:05:59,160
And it was very well tolerated.

97
0:05:59,160 --> 0:06:03,320
And they plan to submit, um, both to the FDA and the European, uh,

98
0:06:03,320 --> 0:06:06,360
medicines agency for expansion of their EUA.

99
0:06:07,080 --> 0:06:12,360
Um, they also provided updates on the fact that they are looking at, uh,

100
0:06:12,360 --> 0:06:17,560
children, uh, down to as young as six months of age, so the six months to 11-year-old.

101
0:06:17,560 --> 0:06:21,400
Um, so just to go into just a little bit of weeds, um, this was a press release.

102
0:06:21,400 --> 0:06:23,800
This is not, um, a peer-reviewed publication.

103
0:06:24,360 --> 0:06:30,680
Um, but in this study, they looked at 2,260 adolescents in this 15, in this 12 to 15 years

104
0:06:30,680 --> 0:06:37,560
of age in the United States, and they observed 18 cases of COVID in the placebo group, zero

105
0:06:37,560 --> 0:06:39,080
in the vaccinated group.

106
0:06:39,080 --> 0:06:42,360
So this is that 100% efficacy against infection.

107
0:06:42,920 --> 0:06:46,280
Um, they also reported this robust antibody responses.

108
0:06:46,280 --> 0:06:49,800
So, um, this data will be submitted for peer review publication.

109
0:06:49,800 --> 0:06:54,520
And we have that, um, I will be certain to circle back to it, uh, testing.

110
0:06:55,080 --> 0:07:00,040
Um, you know, I want to keep trying to reinforce testing is a major pillar of the current

111
0:07:00,040 --> 0:07:04,040
strategy, um, to defeat COVID-19.

112
0:07:04,040 --> 0:07:08,840
And, uh, one of the major employers city group has actually set up this three times a week

113
0:07:08,840 --> 0:07:10,440
in home testing for its employees.

114
0:07:11,000 --> 0:07:14,200
Um, they're using this $5 per test, um, approach.

115
0:07:14,760 --> 0:07:18,760
Um, it's a rapid self-administered antigen test.

116
0:07:18,760 --> 0:07:20,920
It's applied by the ANOVA medical group.

117
0:07:21,560 --> 0:07:25,960
Um, and this is one of those, um, lateral flows or those pregnancy type tests that people

118
0:07:25,960 --> 0:07:28,360
might be familiar with, but instead of peeing on it, right?

119
0:07:28,360 --> 0:07:33,240
You're going to swab your nose and you put it in a little bit of fluid and then it runs out.

120
0:07:33,240 --> 0:07:39,560
Um, so actually, uh, this is not just the US as actually speaking to a, uh, friend of mine

121
0:07:39,560 --> 0:07:43,320
and, uh, their colleague in London got their three month kit.

122
0:07:43,320 --> 0:07:49,720
So this is a real commitment there to try to, um, use testing, um, coupled with vaccinations,

123
0:07:49,720 --> 0:07:53,720
coupled with mitigation, everything we could do to, uh, to get on top of this.

124
0:07:53,720 --> 0:08:02,840
Um, the FDA also granted EUA, uh, to an at home, um, over-the-counter molecular nucleic

125
0:08:02,840 --> 0:08:04,840
acid amplification test.

126
0:08:04,840 --> 0:08:07,400
This is called the Q COVID-19.

127
0:08:07,960 --> 0:08:10,440
Um, and this is, uh, I'd say kind of a cute little test.

128
0:08:11,000 --> 0:08:15,400
Um, you get this whole kit with a, uh, single use test cartridge.

129
0:08:15,960 --> 0:08:20,680
Um, and this, uh, sample, sample one, basically you're going to swab up your nose.

130
0:08:20,680 --> 0:08:22,520
Um, you're going to put it in this cartridge.

131
0:08:22,520 --> 0:08:28,120
And then that cartridge is going to go in the Q cartridge reader, um, provided separately.

132
0:08:28,120 --> 0:08:31,720
I felt like I'm like back in the 80s with batteries being supplied separately.

133
0:08:31,720 --> 0:08:35,320
Hopefully the reusable batteries are going to, you know, come with this.

134
0:08:35,320 --> 0:08:39,720
But it's really a battery operated, um, home testing kit.

135
0:08:40,680 --> 0:08:43,240
And this, um, gives you results in about 20 minutes.

136
0:08:43,240 --> 0:08:46,600
So the way they sort of market this is you're going to swab your nose while you're getting

137
0:08:46,600 --> 0:08:47,800
ready in the morning.

138
0:08:47,800 --> 0:08:51,640
Go take your shower, brush your teeth, do whatever, come back, make sure your test is

139
0:08:51,640 --> 0:08:57,160
negative before you, uh, go to work or school or any social activities.

140
0:08:57,720 --> 0:09:03,800
And according to the FDA evaluation, the test correctly identified 96% of the positive samples

141
0:09:04,440 --> 0:09:06,360
from individuals that had symptoms.

142
0:09:06,360 --> 0:09:07,720
And I thought this was a little interesting.

143
0:09:08,280 --> 0:09:12,440
A hundred percent of the positive samples from individuals without symptoms.

144
0:09:12,440 --> 0:09:17,320
So really a very sensitive test for both symptomatic and as we're talking here,

145
0:09:17,320 --> 0:09:22,120
asymptomatic screening, uh, for a return to workplace also, I think it's exciting week for

146
0:09:22,120 --> 0:09:29,160
testing the Amazon real-time RTPCR tests for detecting SARS-CoV-2 also got EUA.

147
0:09:29,960 --> 0:09:35,000
And so the very similar, the Amazon COVID-19 test collection kit includes, um,

148
0:09:35,000 --> 0:09:42,280
a nasal swab, uh, collection, uh, tube, biohazard bag, um, instructions and a sample drop off.

149
0:09:42,280 --> 0:09:44,120
So this is not all being done in the home.

150
0:09:44,120 --> 0:09:48,840
This is really a home collection kit, which is then being sent, um, out to a lab.

151
0:09:49,720 --> 0:09:54,840
Um, also wanted to give an update on our T detect T cell test by adaptive, right?

152
0:09:54,840 --> 0:09:57,880
Uh, this is that test that a physician doesn't order.

153
0:09:57,880 --> 0:10:02,440
So actually the patient will go online, um, they'll type in T dash detect,

154
0:10:03,320 --> 0:10:07,960
and it will pop up the adaptive website where the patient themselves goes through,

155
0:10:07,960 --> 0:10:13,000
answers a bunch of questions, um, gets a blood test, um, which tells whether or

156
0:10:13,000 --> 0:10:19,000
not they're T cells, whether you have memory T cells, um, evident of a prior COVID-19 infection.

157
0:10:19,880 --> 0:10:25,960
And the hope, um, that I discussed before is that those, um, individuals who could not get a PCR

158
0:10:25,960 --> 0:10:30,760
test upfront, who maybe are now serology negative can get this test.

159
0:10:31,480 --> 0:10:34,440
Um, but then comes the question that I've gotten from individuals.

160
0:10:34,440 --> 0:10:37,160
What about, um, someone who's got a vaccine?

161
0:10:37,160 --> 0:10:43,720
Um, and as I mentioned, there are thousands of T cell, um, epitopes that we see, um,

162
0:10:43,720 --> 0:10:49,720
that target, um, the spike protein, but there's also TCRs that target other proteins.

163
0:10:49,720 --> 0:10:51,480
Imagine that there's other proteins.

164
0:10:51,480 --> 0:10:55,880
I hope everyone enjoyed that sort of my, if you listen to the rest of Twiv,

165
0:10:55,880 --> 0:10:58,440
you hear our obsession with the spike protein.

166
0:10:59,000 --> 0:11:01,240
And they're actually looking at modifying the algorithm.

167
0:11:01,240 --> 0:11:06,360
So we will be in the future able to tell whether this is a T cell response purely targeted

168
0:11:06,360 --> 0:11:11,480
at spike or whether this also targeting of other, some of the other proteins will be able to use

169
0:11:11,480 --> 0:11:17,320
this also to distinguish vaccination versus vaccination with prior natural infections.

170
0:11:17,320 --> 0:11:18,760
And we'll spend too much time on this.

171
0:11:18,760 --> 0:11:23,000
There's been a lot in the press about some overcharging of some of the New York City, um,

172
0:11:23,720 --> 0:11:27,480
uh, hospitals with regards to testing, $3,000 per test.

173
0:11:28,120 --> 0:11:31,800
I think this is unfortunate and it undermines confidence in testing.

174
0:11:31,800 --> 0:11:34,600
So, um, I'm glad that this is being brought to light.

175
0:11:34,600 --> 0:11:36,200
This really needs to be corrected.

176
0:11:36,200 --> 0:11:39,880
Um, the CARES Act was supposed to guarantee that individuals could,

177
0:11:40,520 --> 0:11:47,640
at no financial risk, go get tested, find out if they have COVID-19 before they spread it to others.

178
0:11:47,640 --> 0:11:50,120
So, um, I hope this all is, is addressed.

179
0:11:50,840 --> 0:11:55,720
All right, active vaccination, um, you know, I know I started off with some negativity,

180
0:11:55,720 --> 0:12:01,400
but here's some really positive news, um, more data from the CDC MMWR.

181
0:12:01,400 --> 0:12:04,440
And this is all about real world vaccine efficacy.

182
0:12:04,440 --> 0:12:11,320
So, we had the interim estimates of vaccine effectiveness of the BNT162B2,

183
0:12:11,320 --> 0:12:15,880
an mRNA 1273 COVID-19 vaccines,

184
0:12:15,880 --> 0:12:19,800
in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare personnel,

185
0:12:19,800 --> 0:12:23,320
first responders, and other essential and frontline workers,

186
0:12:23,320 --> 0:12:27,960
eight US locations, uh, December 2020 to March 2021.

187
0:12:27,960 --> 0:12:33,160
Um, so really this is how well did those RNA vaccines actually work in the real world?

188
0:12:33,720 --> 0:12:40,600
Um, and in this early release publication, um, they prospectively followed 3,950 healthcare personnel,

189
0:12:40,600 --> 0:12:47,480
first responders, another essential and frontline workers, um, that completed weekly SARS-CoV testing

190
0:12:47,480 --> 0:12:50,360
for 13, um, consecutive weeks.

191
0:12:50,360 --> 0:12:55,560
And under real world conditions, mRNA vaccine effectiveness of full immunization,

192
0:12:55,560 --> 0:13:01,720
so greater than 14 days after second dose was 90% against SARS-CoV-2 infections,

193
0:13:02,360 --> 0:13:07,000
um, regardless of symptom status, um, and just with partial immunization.

194
0:13:07,000 --> 0:13:11,880
So, um, this greater than 14 days after first dose, we were already at 80%.

195
0:13:11,880 --> 0:13:17,240
So, we're seeing a growing amount of real world evidence regarding the safety and effectiveness

196
0:13:17,240 --> 0:13:18,280
of vaccines.

197
0:13:18,280 --> 0:13:25,080
We also had an initial report of decreased SARS-CoV-2 viral load after inoculation with BNT,

198
0:13:25,080 --> 0:13:31,000
162 B2 vaccine, um, and this was published in Nature Medicine, um, the authors here presented

199
0:13:31,000 --> 0:13:37,080
data that the previously was out as a preprint describing that in those that had a positive test,

200
0:13:37,080 --> 0:13:41,320
despite vaccination, the viral loads were about, um, four times lower.

201
0:13:41,320 --> 0:13:46,600
Um, so there was an abrupt change at 12 days after vaccinations that went from an average

202
0:13:46,600 --> 0:13:55,240
CT value of 25 up to 27. So remember this, the higher the CT means it takes more cycles to pick

203
0:13:55,240 --> 0:14:02,600
up the RNA. Um, and so the 25 to 27 was for the RNA dependent RNA polymerase primers.

204
0:14:03,240 --> 0:14:09,880
And this roughly translates, right? This, this wasn't set specifically, but about 600,000,

205
0:14:09,880 --> 0:14:16,840
um, down to 150,000, um, ending use of NAT detectable units are RNA copy numbers.

206
0:14:16,840 --> 0:14:21,640
Um, so even a little more encouraging than that initial data that was posted on GitHub that we

207
0:14:21,640 --> 0:14:26,040
discussed back in February. There also were several letters. This was like the week of, uh,

208
0:14:26,040 --> 0:14:33,240
real world experience of in the New England Journal, um, such as BNT, 162 B2 mRNA COVID-19

209
0:14:33,240 --> 0:14:39,400
vaccine effectiveness among healthcare workers, early evidence of the effect of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine

210
0:14:39,400 --> 0:14:45,560
at one medical center and SARS-CoV-2 infection after vaccination in healthcare workers in California.

211
0:14:45,560 --> 0:14:49,960
Um, and basically we're seeing consistently that the vaccines have excellent efficacy

212
0:14:49,960 --> 0:14:56,040
at preventing severe disease, symptomatic disease, asymptomatic disease. Um, and even in these post

213
0:14:56,040 --> 0:15:01,320
vaccination infections, the viral load appears to be substantially lower, suggesting a major

214
0:15:01,320 --> 0:15:05,800
impact on interrupting transmission. Well, what about lessons learned from the vaccine rollout?

215
0:15:05,800 --> 0:15:10,840
So I've suggested before that instead of focusing on who did what wrong, we should focus on what was

216
0:15:10,840 --> 0:15:16,680
done and how we can learn should this not be the last pandemic. So a big part of the vaccination

217
0:15:16,680 --> 0:15:21,720
issues was the logistics getting of vaccines into arms. Um, so there was actually a really nice

218
0:15:21,720 --> 0:15:28,680
piece in Politico on March 29th, exploring this issue entitled Biden administration remakes vaccine

219
0:15:28,680 --> 0:15:34,200
strategy after mass vaccination sites fizzle. Um, and really just to cut to the chase on this.

220
0:15:34,200 --> 0:15:39,880
Um, once they sort of went to the, say, the traditional approaches, they, they let the

221
0:15:39,880 --> 0:15:45,480
backs, um, the pharmacies start vaccinating. We've really seen an escalation in our ability to do

222
0:15:45,480 --> 0:15:52,200
an incredible number of millions of vaccinations per day. So, um, their comment was that, um,

223
0:15:52,200 --> 0:15:56,600
they're moving towards this, um, towards this approach. I wanted to finish this section with

224
0:15:56,600 --> 0:16:01,640
my question of where's Elvis? Um, I was just in a talk this week where there was a, there was an

225
0:16:01,640 --> 0:16:07,080
update on, um, the polio vaccination experience that was kind of trickling and wrong with an

226
0:16:07,080 --> 0:16:14,200
uptake of about 0.6%. Um, and then along comes Elvis and he gets his vaccination. Um, six months

227
0:16:14,200 --> 0:16:20,200
later, the uptake was up to 80%. So, um, I don't, I don't think we're quite there yet at that

228
0:16:20,200 --> 0:16:25,640
greater than 80%, but I'm hoping that we can all work together to get there. All right, passive

229
0:16:25,640 --> 0:16:31,240
vaccination. Um, you know, I, I like to talk about, um, variants of concern in this section,

230
0:16:31,240 --> 0:16:38,120
because my biggest concern, um, is the impact on monoclonal therapies. Um, and I, I like to feel

231
0:16:38,120 --> 0:16:43,560
that if we were, if we were doing a better job with our behaviors of concern, we would be, um,

232
0:16:43,560 --> 0:16:49,480
in a little less, less trouble here. And we actually have a, um, whole bunch of studies going on

233
0:16:49,480 --> 0:16:54,680
where we're trying to update our, um, our sequencing. So, we have a better sense of where we are with

234
0:16:54,680 --> 0:16:59,480
these, with these issues. Um, and along these lines, we actually got a little more, um,

235
0:16:59,480 --> 0:17:06,840
information in the monoclonal arena. Um, I discussed the data for GSK and VIR biotechnology. Um,

236
0:17:06,840 --> 0:17:12,600
and they've actually gone ahead and filed an application to US regulators for EUA for their

237
0:17:12,600 --> 0:17:17,400
antibody. Um, this was based on the data that I previously discussed where they demonstrated an

238
0:17:17,400 --> 0:17:22,920
85% reduction in hospitalizations for deaths. Um, when their therapy was given in the first

239
0:17:22,920 --> 0:17:28,280
seven to 10 days of COVID-19 infection. Um, now this monoclonal therapy, as I mentioned,

240
0:17:28,280 --> 0:17:33,880
it targets an invariant region of the spike protein. Um, so it isn't something that we're

241
0:17:33,880 --> 0:17:39,800
quite as concerned, um, that the virus will mutate away from as far as efficacy. It also has an

242
0:17:39,800 --> 0:17:46,040
extended half life, uh, may last for up to a year. So we may have broader applications here,

243
0:17:46,040 --> 0:17:51,400
because as we're learning, not everyone can mount a really good response to the vaccines.

244
0:17:51,400 --> 0:17:57,160
Not everyone wants to, um, mount a really good response to the vaccines. Um, so this gives us

245
0:17:57,160 --> 0:18:03,960
one more potential, um, therapy to use not only for, um, acute infections, but potentially for the

246
0:18:03,960 --> 0:18:09,560
prophylaxis opportunity. Um, I got a monoclonal vaccine question here that I thought was entertaining,

247
0:18:09,560 --> 0:18:14,120
but I would share it's informative. Um, so it was one of our pro health internists,

248
0:18:14,120 --> 0:18:19,640
Brooke Keene, um, had this question. Um, and this is, this is coming up more and more. So one of

249
0:18:19,640 --> 0:18:27,960
their patients, 66 years old overweight, high BMI, um, and it's seven weeks after the second dose of

250
0:18:27,960 --> 0:18:34,920
the Pfizer COVID vaccine. They end up exposed to COVID, um, a few days later. Um, and I should say

251
0:18:34,920 --> 0:18:41,000
because, uh, Vincent's exposed to SARS-CoV-2, a person who has COVID-19. Um, and a few days later,

252
0:18:41,000 --> 0:18:47,000
this patient starts to develop respiratory symptoms, gets tested and is, um, has a positive test for

253
0:18:47,000 --> 0:18:52,840
SARS-CoV-2. Um, and due to his age and comorbidities, he's actually treated with monoclonal

254
0:18:52,840 --> 0:18:57,160
antibody, um, therapy. Now he's completely fine at this point. And I have to say, this is an

255
0:18:57,160 --> 0:19:01,880
interesting question. Does he go ahead? Does he need a boost? Does he need to be re-vaccinated?

256
0:19:02,520 --> 0:19:07,400
And this is an area that I think is sort of more of our subtleties, right? For some reason, um,

257
0:19:07,400 --> 0:19:14,200
we do see people who get fully vaccinated who then go on to get infected, right? I mean,

258
0:19:14,200 --> 0:19:18,920
our therapies, our trials were not a hundred percent. Um, so in cases where monoclonals are

259
0:19:18,920 --> 0:19:23,320
given less than two weeks after the second dose, um, you know, and we're seeing this,

260
0:19:23,320 --> 0:19:27,080
I do recommend re-vaccinating, but here the interval is a little bit longer, right? Because

261
0:19:27,080 --> 0:19:33,400
you're waiting for that person to, um, recover and you're waiting that three months. But my advice

262
0:19:33,400 --> 0:19:38,520
in this case was to actually go ahead, um, wait that three months, um, and then evaluate this by

263
0:19:38,520 --> 0:19:43,720
getting anybody levels. And actually, um, that point, hopefully we'll have more information about, um,

264
0:19:43,720 --> 0:19:49,320
giving a third dose or in the case of J and J, maybe a booster dose, uh, to individuals who get

265
0:19:49,320 --> 0:19:56,040
infected, um, despite vaccination, um, the incubation pre-exposure period. Um, I, and you keep reminding

266
0:19:56,040 --> 0:20:01,640
people that tests do not predict the future. There still is this two to 14 day incubation period.

267
0:20:01,640 --> 0:20:06,600
Um, even when we do that early test out option, we're still 20, 30% of people are

268
0:20:06,600 --> 0:20:14,280
becoming symptomatic or becoming, uh, PCR positive after that seven days, right? So we want to,

269
0:20:14,280 --> 0:20:18,840
we want to be careful here. Um, I'll say at least here in the New York, particularly the Nassau

270
0:20:18,840 --> 0:20:24,680
County area, we're about a 5% positivity rate. We are, we are actually above rates where we were

271
0:20:24,680 --> 0:20:30,200
in the, the surge of last summer. This is that critical period of detectable viral replication,

272
0:20:30,200 --> 0:20:35,720
the viral symptom phase. Um, this is when I keep shaking my head when I hear the stories of the

273
0:20:35,720 --> 0:20:41,960
experiences that my patients who get admitted, um, have had at some of the care centers. Remember,

274
0:20:41,960 --> 0:20:47,560
the first seven to 10 days that viral symptom phase, this is the time for monoclonals and

275
0:20:47,560 --> 0:20:53,160
monitoring. This is not the time for steroids. This is not the time for antibiotics. Once you

276
0:20:53,160 --> 0:20:59,080
get into that early inflammatory phase, hopefully all our patients that qualify have gotten monoclonals,

277
0:20:59,080 --> 0:21:04,040
but you get into the early inflammatory phase, your patient is monitoring their oxygen level at

278
0:21:04,040 --> 0:21:11,240
home with a pulse oximeter. If the oxygen saturation drops below 94% at rest, then it's time for

279
0:21:11,240 --> 0:21:14,920
steroids. I noticed a lot of people are giving these med roll dose packs, which is really just a

280
0:21:14,920 --> 0:21:21,400
five day course of steroids. Um, we studied dexamethasone, six milligrams, P O Q day times 10 days.

281
0:21:21,960 --> 0:21:28,360
An equivalent would be prednisone, 40 milligrams, P O Q day times 10 days. Um, I'm going to recommend

282
0:21:28,360 --> 0:21:34,440
we stick, um, as much as we can with what we was, we, we studied. Um, I think the 10 days made sense.

283
0:21:34,440 --> 0:21:39,320
That's why it was studied that way. Um, so let's try to try to do that. It's cheaper than the

284
0:21:39,320 --> 0:21:44,040
med roll dose back by the way. Um, and there are millions of people that are still going to need

285
0:21:44,040 --> 0:21:49,960
this therapy in the coming months. Unfortunately, um, oxygen. Um, that's when we start licking it

286
0:21:49,960 --> 0:21:55,480
oxygen. That's when we start licking it. Anticoagulation. That's when we consider remdesivir. I like to

287
0:21:55,480 --> 0:22:00,520
point out the secondary infection phase is not until week three. So this first admission,

288
0:22:00,520 --> 0:22:06,600
it is very rare for them to end up benefiting from antibiotics. Um, but some of the recent data we

289
0:22:06,600 --> 0:22:12,920
saw is the majority of people with COVID-19 admitted in this country. I was publication in IDSA,

290
0:22:12,920 --> 0:22:19,160
receive a course of antibiotics. Um, so I think, um, this is not going to bode well if that's how

291
0:22:19,160 --> 0:22:24,840
we're approaching this viral disease with overuse of antibiotics. So our next, um, Armageddon will

292
0:22:24,840 --> 0:22:29,880
be antibiotic resistant infections. The multi system inflammatory phase, as I mentioned,

293
0:22:29,880 --> 0:22:34,840
a trend towards more severity, more ICU level care for our kids. Um, this is where you really

294
0:22:34,840 --> 0:22:41,720
have to be careful. You want to have a clear diagnosis and then steroids, IVIG supportive care. Um,

295
0:22:41,720 --> 0:22:49,080
and then the, the tail phase long COVID. Um, and I'm going to say the best treatment we have so far

296
0:22:49,080 --> 0:22:55,000
for long COVID appears to be vaccination. Um, I, I got a, I got a, uh, it's actually a text the

297
0:22:55,000 --> 0:23:00,120
other day from, um, one of my colleagues, Justin Aaron at Columbia. And I thought this was very

298
0:23:00,120 --> 0:23:05,960
entertaining. We're seeing now, um, multiple reports of an increased likelihood of a person

299
0:23:05,960 --> 0:23:11,080
getting better reporting improvement in symptoms with long COVID after vaccination.

300
0:23:11,080 --> 0:23:15,320
Um, and it's with all the vaccines now. Initially we saw it with the mRNA vaccines, but we're seeing

301
0:23:15,320 --> 0:23:19,400
it with AstraZeneca and some other countries. We're seeing it with J&J right here in this country.

302
0:23:19,880 --> 0:23:25,720
Um, I was on the Brian Lares there show and one of the J&J, uh, recipients who had, uh,

303
0:23:25,720 --> 0:23:30,840
resolved symptoms called in very enjoyable. Um, but Justin Aaron was relating an individual

304
0:23:30,840 --> 0:23:37,160
who had gone many months without the ability to smell or taste and now, um, was complaining of a,

305
0:23:37,160 --> 0:23:44,920
of a super sense of smell. Um, and I don't think that, um, a vaccine gives you super smell powers.

306
0:23:44,920 --> 0:23:50,040
I just think this individual had forgotten how smelly the world is. Um, and that was complaining

307
0:23:50,040 --> 0:23:55,320
about going into rooms and being overpowered by the amount of perfume. Um, I have to say,

308
0:23:55,320 --> 0:23:59,480
people are using a little bit more perfume than before. Maybe because everyone's wearing masks

309
0:23:59,480 --> 0:24:03,480
and they're trying to overdo it. And here's someone who now got his sense of smell back. So,

310
0:24:04,200 --> 0:24:08,360
it's encouraging to see these people getting better. There's a real drive for these people with

311
0:24:08,360 --> 0:24:13,640
long COVID to, um, want to get an opportunity to get vaccinated. Um, and we're seeing fortunately

312
0:24:13,640 --> 0:24:18,760
across the country a dropping in the age for eligibility and increase in the supply for the

313
0:24:18,760 --> 0:24:24,200
vaccine. So, um, I think I'm going to end here on what is more of a positive note than I started.

314
0:24:24,840 --> 0:24:30,680
But we're still not quite there. Um, and I do want to say we're very US centric, I think,

315
0:24:31,640 --> 0:24:36,680
because here we have vaccines here. Things are getting better. Um, but a lot of the world is

316
0:24:36,680 --> 0:24:42,040
struggling. Um, this isn't just Asia. This isn't just sub Saharan Africa. This isn't just South

317
0:24:42,040 --> 0:24:47,560
America. Um, this is Europe. This is many places throughout the world. Um, and I'm going to say,

318
0:24:47,560 --> 0:24:52,680
as I conclude, um, thank you so much for all the support today. Um, and continue to go to

319
0:24:52,680 --> 0:24:58,040
parasites without borders.com and support us because we are committed that we are going to give, um,

320
0:24:58,040 --> 0:25:02,840
forty thousand dollars to American Society of Tropical Medicine and hygiene, um, to support

321
0:25:02,840 --> 0:25:10,600
scholarships for early career women from low income countries, uh, to attend this fall meeting,

322
0:25:10,600 --> 0:25:14,840
the American Society of Tropical Medicine, who otherwise would not be able to attend.

323
0:25:14,840 --> 0:25:20,440
All right. It's time for some, uh, email. If you want to send Daniel a question, it's Daniel at

324
0:25:20,440 --> 0:25:28,600
microbe.tv and Christian sent a link to a preprint describing, uh, some of the initial

325
0:25:29,400 --> 0:25:35,960
thrombotic events associated with, uh, AstraZeneca vaccination. And I wondered, Daniel, if you had

326
0:25:35,960 --> 0:25:42,360
any thoughts on the nature of those events and what that means? Sure. You know, it's a challenge.

327
0:25:42,360 --> 0:25:47,320
I'm doing a, I'm going to talk later this week for the G six PD community. Um, and they're quite

328
0:25:47,320 --> 0:25:51,880
concerned about, you know, is there one vaccine that might be safer for people with certain

329
0:25:51,880 --> 0:25:56,520
comorbidities, certain people with, you know, red cell disorders? Um, and I have to say it's

330
0:25:56,520 --> 0:26:01,560
really, it's really tough. Cause as we talked about this, um, the, this is one of those where they

331
0:26:01,560 --> 0:26:06,280
said the preponderance of scientific evidence does not support a connection between these

332
0:26:06,280 --> 0:26:12,200
clocks and vaccination. Uh, the rate is that, which is seen, um, you know, background rates.

333
0:26:12,200 --> 0:26:17,000
So we don't know, but despite that, um, despite it only being about a one in a million phenomenon,

334
0:26:17,000 --> 0:26:21,640
which is what we see in the unvaccinated population. Um, there's a lot of names. There's a lot of

335
0:26:21,640 --> 0:26:26,760
descriptions. There's sort of a timing, right? This is happening seven to 14 days after.

336
0:26:26,760 --> 0:26:32,680
Um, so I sort of leave it there. I, I do not know if this vaccine is causing these phenomenon.

337
0:26:32,680 --> 0:26:37,160
I don't know if this is just something, you know, when you give 30 million vaccines, you see 30

338
0:26:37,160 --> 0:26:41,960
events. Um, you know, we talked about, um, I was like to talk about the dog bite thing, you know,

339
0:26:41,960 --> 0:26:46,600
people who didn't get vaccinated were more likely to get bitten by dogs. I do not think vaccinations

340
0:26:46,600 --> 0:26:52,200
prevent you from getting bitten by dogs. Um, so I do not know. Um, and it'll be interesting to

341
0:26:52,200 --> 0:26:57,720
explore, um, 30 cases is very hard to give you enough evidence to really make a connection or

342
0:26:57,720 --> 0:27:04,040
understand this phenomenon well. Daniel and Denmark, they recommend pulling the syringe back to make

343
0:27:04,040 --> 0:27:08,200
sure you're not in a blood vessel. Is that important to do? Yeah, we do that everywhere.

344
0:27:08,840 --> 0:27:15,560
So actually, um, when I, when I posted my getting my vaccination, it was, uh, the pharmacist was

345
0:27:15,560 --> 0:27:19,560
doing it. I think she maybe she was nervous because she was on camera. Um, but that's what you're

346
0:27:19,560 --> 0:27:23,480
supposed to do to make sure you're in the muscle and not in a blood vessel. You, you put it in,

347
0:27:23,480 --> 0:27:27,080
you draw back a little on the syringe, make sure there's no blood coming back and then you give

348
0:27:27,080 --> 0:27:33,320
your IM injection. So, um, actually we recommend that everywhere. So I know actually that was

349
0:27:33,320 --> 0:27:36,680
specifically the idea that, oh, because if it goes in the blood, maybe that's what triggered

350
0:27:36,680 --> 0:27:40,680
those 30 events. I, I don't think there's a connection there, but yeah, you want to properly

351
0:27:40,680 --> 0:27:46,520
give an IM. Okay. Okay. All right. Emma writes, my mom is on multiple rheumatoid arthritis

352
0:27:46,520 --> 0:27:53,560
medications. And she lists a bunch that suppress her T cells received first Moderna vaccine a few

353
0:27:53,560 --> 0:27:58,280
weeks ago. She did talk to the rheumatologist before vaccination. They did not suggest any

354
0:27:58,280 --> 0:28:01,880
changes to her medication. Now she found out that the American college of rheumatology

355
0:28:01,880 --> 0:28:07,000
recommends stopping a bat test sept one week prior to an one week after the first dose,

356
0:28:07,000 --> 0:28:11,320
but continuing the medication for the second dose. Do you think she will have a strong immune

357
0:28:11,320 --> 0:28:15,800
response to the second dose, even if her first may have been dampened by the RA medication or

358
0:28:15,800 --> 0:28:21,240
would stopping a bad test step to one week before and after the second dose be the best option?

359
0:28:22,600 --> 0:28:28,920
Okay. Well, that's a good sophisticated question. So a bad set is actually a drug we use for

360
0:28:28,920 --> 0:28:33,560
treatment of a lot of autoimmune diseases, ones where we think there's a T cell issue.

361
0:28:33,560 --> 0:28:39,960
And basically you're targeting something called CTLA4, which is a co-stimulatory molecule.

362
0:28:39,960 --> 0:28:44,120
So the question here, right, is we've all learned that it's not just about B cells. It's not just

363
0:28:44,120 --> 0:28:49,960
about antibodies. We want to see a nice robust T cell response. And here is an individual who

364
0:28:49,960 --> 0:28:55,160
actually is on a drug that is interfering with appropriate T cell response. So one of the first

365
0:28:55,160 --> 0:29:00,840
things I always like want people to think about is the pharmacokinetics of this therapy. So you

366
0:29:00,840 --> 0:29:05,720
give a therapy and a lot of people, I think maybe they learned this with tosyllizumab,

367
0:29:05,720 --> 0:29:10,600
you give that therapy and it doesn't just work for one day. There's a certain, you know, at half

368
0:29:10,600 --> 0:29:16,760
life, a period before elimination. And the period, the half life of elimination for this drug is

369
0:29:16,760 --> 0:29:23,000
about two weeks, which is actually interesting when you think about gaps between them. So ideally,

370
0:29:23,000 --> 0:29:27,880
you want to have as much of a gap as you can, but you're balancing this against not treating

371
0:29:27,880 --> 0:29:32,360
the disease. So this is what we're doing a lot of times. We're sort of, you know, I guess

372
0:29:32,360 --> 0:29:37,400
on the fly making these recommendations and we're saying, if you can space this out great,

373
0:29:37,400 --> 0:29:43,960
we definitely recommend people with immunosuppressive conditions. Go ahead and get vaccinated. We are

374
0:29:43,960 --> 0:29:49,720
concerned that they may not get as robust a response as we would like. Yeah, the more you

375
0:29:49,720 --> 0:29:55,320
can space it away from those vaccines, the better. Just think about it. If you space it two weeks

376
0:29:55,320 --> 0:30:01,400
away, you've only gotten down to about half the therapeutic level. So that's, I'm going to sort

377
0:30:01,400 --> 0:30:05,720
of leave this with this is going to have to be a judgment call. The more you can space these

378
0:30:05,720 --> 0:30:12,840
therapies away from either the first or the second shot, the better. So Kim writes, I have two little

379
0:30:12,840 --> 0:30:17,160
ones, two and a half years, 12 months in daycare, three days a week, there have been cases,

380
0:30:17,160 --> 0:30:22,040
though not in their classrooms. It's scary as heck nonetheless. I'm wondering if clinicians will

381
0:30:22,040 --> 0:30:27,640
recommend routine antibody testing for youth at some point. There was a toddler in the center who

382
0:30:27,640 --> 0:30:32,600
had MISC, he's out of the hospital and home. There was an exposure, but never tested positive.

383
0:30:32,600 --> 0:30:37,800
No one can be sure that daycare is where the exposure happened, but timing of MISC was five

384
0:30:37,800 --> 0:30:42,200
weeks after the classroom was quarantined. It's a nerve-racking time to be apparent. I'm hopeful

385
0:30:42,200 --> 0:30:45,800
that the Moderna youth trials will go well. I don't know how I'm going to mentally take another

386
0:30:45,800 --> 0:30:52,360
year of this anxiety. Yeah, I know it's tough. The biggest thing here is when can we get our

387
0:30:52,360 --> 0:30:57,560
younger individuals vaccinated, right? So we're saying we're going to have enough vaccines for all

388
0:30:57,560 --> 0:31:03,080
our 16 and up by the end of May. We anticipate by the time we get it to June. I'm going to try

389
0:31:03,080 --> 0:31:08,920
to be honest. I'm not going to do the underpromise overdeliver. I'm going to do the honest. We hope

390
0:31:08,920 --> 0:31:15,880
by June, we have an extension of the EUA to allow us to get down to our 12-year-olds, right? So 12,

391
0:31:15,880 --> 0:31:23,640
13, 14, 15, in addition to 16 and up. So June, we can really offer vaccinations to that population

392
0:31:23,640 --> 0:31:29,320
June and July. But as we know, we are ongoing trials getting us all the way down to six months.

393
0:31:29,320 --> 0:31:34,520
That's going to be critical. Really, what's more important than antibody testing in most situations

394
0:31:34,520 --> 0:31:40,600
is trying to detect the virus, trying to test as many people. And there really is a big effort

395
0:31:40,600 --> 0:31:47,080
and a lot of finance behind this to more rapid testing in addition to PCR testing. The more tests

396
0:31:47,080 --> 0:31:51,480
you do, the more likely you're going to pick things up. But yeah, unfortunately, with the MIS-C,

397
0:31:51,480 --> 0:31:56,360
as this boy out here, a lot of times we don't even catch that acute infection in kids.

398
0:31:56,360 --> 0:32:01,240
They start getting sick and we realize it's MIS-C because we pick up the antibody tests.

399
0:32:01,960 --> 0:32:07,960
One more from Ellen. I have a friend in Paris just short of 65 years old had COVID last March.

400
0:32:07,960 --> 0:32:12,200
March 3 this year was diagnosed again this time with the UK variant. On March 21,

401
0:32:12,200 --> 0:32:17,320
three weeks after diagnosis, our TPCR symptomatic still. Her antibodies were tested

402
0:32:17,320 --> 0:32:22,280
were almost non-existent. She'll be getting the vaccine shortly, AstraZeneca, and I advised her to

403
0:32:22,280 --> 0:32:28,040
have them tested again three weeks after the second dose. If she still has few or no antibodies,

404
0:32:28,040 --> 0:32:32,200
would she be a good candidate for monoclonal antibodies? She's concerned long-term that

405
0:32:32,200 --> 0:32:37,000
without antibodies, she will be liable to reinfection forever. Should she get trusted for T cells,

406
0:32:37,000 --> 0:32:41,320
although from what I understand from SET-T, they will not protect her from infection.

407
0:32:41,320 --> 0:32:49,480
Actually, they're very sophisticated. Those are interesting ideas. We have the idea that

408
0:32:49,480 --> 0:32:55,320
the antibodies prevent you from getting infected, that the T cell is very quickly clear. I think

409
0:32:55,320 --> 0:32:59,000
the kinetics, people may not know the kinetics. I was joking about those people. They know how

410
0:32:59,000 --> 0:33:02,920
long a red cell lasts, but they don't know how long a T cell lasts. They don't know how long

411
0:33:02,920 --> 0:33:07,960
it takes for the T cell response to fire up. The T cell response we know from the T to text

412
0:33:07,960 --> 0:33:13,720
studies from the adaptive group, about day three to four, you have T cells ramping up. So, they ramp

413
0:33:13,720 --> 0:33:19,800
up pretty quickly. We don't know how much the protection from the vaccines come from T cells,

414
0:33:19,800 --> 0:33:24,680
or how much comes from antibodies. But going forward, I would envision there being certain

415
0:33:24,680 --> 0:33:29,320
individuals, particularly we talked about the person on a bad effect, where maybe they're going

416
0:33:29,320 --> 0:33:33,800
to have an issue with their immune response, particularly a person who's maybe on rituxan,

417
0:33:33,800 --> 0:33:38,680
a therapy that interferes with B cells. In addition to vaccination, maybe these people

418
0:33:38,680 --> 0:33:50,280
are going to get a monoclonal cocktail or a beer GSK variant, non-shifting targeting monoclonal

419
0:33:50,280 --> 0:33:55,240
once a year. So, yeah, I don't think we know yet, but I think these are excellent questions

420
0:33:55,240 --> 0:34:00,040
that are being looked at. And some people, if the prevalence stays as high as it is,

421
0:34:00,040 --> 0:34:05,880
may still need something beyond just the vaccination. The hope is that we get so many people vaccinated

422
0:34:05,880 --> 0:34:11,400
that a chance of exposure becomes minimal. But that will take, as was mentioned,

423
0:34:11,400 --> 0:34:16,120
not only getting all the adults vaccinated, not only getting the adolescents vaccinated,

424
0:34:16,120 --> 0:34:22,840
but getting the kids vaccinated as well. That's COVID-19 clinical update number 56 with Dr. Daniel

425
0:34:22,840 --> 0:34:28,760
Griffin. Thank you, Daniel. Thank you so much. And everyone, be safe. We still have a rough

426
0:34:28,760 --> 0:34:33,880
April ahead of us here. And I know Easter, this is going to drop on Saturday, right before Easter.

427
0:34:33,880 --> 0:35:03,720
Be safe. Keep those group sizes down.
