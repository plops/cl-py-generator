0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:04,480
This week in virology, the podcast about viruses,

2
0:00:04,480 --> 0:00:07,060
the kind that make you sick.

3
0:00:07,060 --> 0:00:10,440
["The Power of Life"]

4
0:00:10,440 --> 0:00:15,640
From Microbe TV, this is Twiv, this week in virology.

5
0:00:15,640 --> 0:00:22,640
Episode 797, recorded on August 26th, 2021.

6
0:00:22,920 --> 0:00:26,760
I'm Vincent Rackeniello, and joining me today

7
0:00:26,760 --> 0:00:29,880
from New York, Daniel Griffin.

8
0:00:29,880 --> 0:00:31,680
Hello, everyone.

9
0:00:31,680 --> 0:00:33,680
Having a good week, Daniel?

10
0:00:33,680 --> 0:00:36,800
You know, I am taking a little time off.

11
0:00:36,800 --> 0:00:38,520
Spent some time with my parents,

12
0:00:38,520 --> 0:00:40,720
which apparently I announced on the Brian Lair Show

13
0:00:40,720 --> 0:00:43,560
before telling them I would spend time with them.

14
0:00:43,560 --> 0:00:44,600
But it was nice.

15
0:00:44,600 --> 0:00:46,680
We're out on the Eastern End of Long Island.

16
0:00:46,680 --> 0:00:48,720
I saw whales every day.

17
0:00:48,720 --> 0:00:49,560
Wow.

18
0:00:49,560 --> 0:00:51,520
Even saw a pod of dolphins at one point.

19
0:00:51,520 --> 0:00:53,040
And apparently my reaction was,

20
0:00:53,040 --> 0:00:55,280
Barnaby, let's swim really fast so we can swim

21
0:00:55,280 --> 0:00:58,520
with the dolphins, but he was a little slow there.

22
0:00:58,520 --> 0:00:59,360
That's cool.

23
0:00:59,360 --> 0:01:00,840
Yeah.

24
0:01:00,840 --> 0:01:02,360
So I want to thank you, Vincent,

25
0:01:02,360 --> 0:01:03,880
for being willing to record this

26
0:01:03,880 --> 0:01:07,240
in late night here Thursday.

27
0:01:07,240 --> 0:01:11,280
And then tomorrow morning, Krakadon, I am off to Virginia.

28
0:01:11,280 --> 0:01:13,800
My daughters, Eloise, we're bringing her down.

29
0:01:13,800 --> 0:01:16,400
Daisy's already down there, and they're starting

30
0:01:16,400 --> 0:01:18,240
fall semester at William and Mary.

31
0:01:18,240 --> 0:01:20,800
Oh my gosh, it's that time already.

32
0:01:20,800 --> 0:01:22,280
Wow.

33
0:01:22,280 --> 0:01:23,600
It is.

34
0:01:23,600 --> 0:01:24,440
Oh boy.

35
0:01:24,440 --> 0:01:25,680
Right until we got a lot today.

36
0:01:25,680 --> 0:01:28,920
I didn't think I would have that much, but boy,

37
0:01:28,920 --> 0:01:31,000
let me start with my quotation.

38
0:01:31,000 --> 0:01:34,360
When one is young, one venerates and despises

39
0:01:34,360 --> 0:01:37,880
without the art of nuances, which constitutes

40
0:01:37,880 --> 0:01:39,480
the best gain of life.

41
0:01:39,480 --> 0:01:42,160
And it is only fair that one has to pay dearly

42
0:01:42,160 --> 0:01:44,640
for having assaulted men in things in this manner

43
0:01:44,640 --> 0:01:46,840
with yes and no.

44
0:01:46,840 --> 0:01:48,960
And that's from Friedrich Nietzsche,

45
0:01:48,960 --> 0:01:50,480
beyond good and evil.

46
0:01:51,640 --> 0:01:52,600
I actually loved his.

47
0:01:52,600 --> 0:01:54,760
I was a philosopher major, as some of our listeners may

48
0:01:54,760 --> 0:01:58,400
or may not know, and I loved reading Nietzsche.

49
0:01:58,400 --> 0:02:00,840
That's not really where I went with philosophy,

50
0:02:00,840 --> 0:02:04,320
but he has some quotes, wonderful quotations.

51
0:02:04,320 --> 0:02:07,320
And I think that nuance needs to be the word

52
0:02:07,320 --> 0:02:09,600
of science education.

53
0:02:09,600 --> 0:02:13,000
You can't just, everyone wants these false dichotomies

54
0:02:13,000 --> 0:02:17,320
and we need to avoid those and really focus on the truth.

55
0:02:17,320 --> 0:02:21,240
All right, so how are things going?

56
0:02:21,240 --> 0:02:24,080
I like to say a single point does not make a line.

57
0:02:24,080 --> 0:02:27,680
And I feel at this point, we are building on knowledge

58
0:02:27,680 --> 0:02:30,360
so people can take a deep breath and relax.

59
0:02:30,360 --> 0:02:32,800
It's not, you're not gonna wake up tomorrow morning

60
0:02:32,800 --> 0:02:35,400
and find something in the news that changes everything.

61
0:02:35,400 --> 0:02:39,240
We are slowly moving in a very positive direction.

62
0:02:40,240 --> 0:02:41,720
I mentioned the false dichotomies.

63
0:02:41,720 --> 0:02:43,680
A few weeks ago, Rich Condit picked a paper

64
0:02:43,680 --> 0:02:47,680
about false dichotomies of the COVID-19 pandemic,

65
0:02:47,680 --> 0:02:50,560
COVID-19 false dichotomies and a comprehensive review

66
0:02:50,560 --> 0:02:52,320
of the evidence regarding public health,

67
0:02:52,320 --> 0:02:56,080
COVID-19 symptomatology, SARS-CoV-2 transmission,

68
0:02:56,080 --> 0:02:58,400
mask wearing and reinfection.

69
0:02:58,400 --> 0:03:01,240
This was published in BMC Infectious Diseases.

70
0:03:02,080 --> 0:03:03,240
It's worth a read, right?

71
0:03:03,240 --> 0:03:05,640
This will be my reader pick right up front.

72
0:03:06,520 --> 0:03:08,600
I know that we've always tried here on Twib

73
0:03:08,600 --> 0:03:10,840
to avoid this black and white.

74
0:03:10,840 --> 0:03:13,640
People wanna know, is it this, is it that?

75
0:03:13,640 --> 0:03:17,000
But the truth is a little more nuanced.

76
0:03:17,000 --> 0:03:19,200
And I think at the end of the day,

77
0:03:19,200 --> 0:03:21,560
the inaccuracies of the black and white approaches

78
0:03:21,560 --> 0:03:22,840
can backfire.

79
0:03:22,840 --> 0:03:25,120
And I think people are sharp enough.

80
0:03:25,120 --> 0:03:27,560
Definitely our audience is sharp enough

81
0:03:27,560 --> 0:03:29,280
to get educated up to the point

82
0:03:29,280 --> 0:03:32,120
where they really understand what they need to.

83
0:03:32,120 --> 0:03:35,480
So children and COVID,

84
0:03:35,480 --> 0:03:37,160
I actually am gonna update my quotation.

85
0:03:37,160 --> 0:03:40,440
I'm just gonna say black and white children are at risk

86
0:03:40,440 --> 0:03:42,560
if they get COVID.

87
0:03:42,560 --> 0:03:43,960
And as I've been saying for a while now,

88
0:03:43,960 --> 0:03:46,360
wearing a mask is less dramatic for a child

89
0:03:46,360 --> 0:03:48,320
than being hospitalized.

90
0:03:48,320 --> 0:03:52,480
When children were protected and did not get COVID,

91
0:03:52,480 --> 0:03:55,320
they could not have a lot of the consequences.

92
0:03:55,320 --> 0:03:58,120
But now children are getting infected.

93
0:03:58,120 --> 0:04:02,680
Was listening to the Andy Slavitt podcast this last week.

94
0:04:02,680 --> 0:04:04,760
And when I heard this number, I was shocked.

95
0:04:04,760 --> 0:04:07,320
So I actually had to go check it out myself.

96
0:04:07,320 --> 0:04:12,320
But 180,175 child COVID-19 cases

97
0:04:12,320 --> 0:04:17,320
were reported the past week from A12 to A19.

98
0:04:18,160 --> 0:04:20,080
That's here in the U.S.

99
0:04:20,080 --> 0:04:23,320
Among states reporting looks,

100
0:04:23,320 --> 0:04:25,320
and this was a little disturbing to me.

101
0:04:25,320 --> 0:04:27,320
We've sort of been saying your child's chance

102
0:04:27,320 --> 0:04:29,320
of ending up in the hospital is about one in 100,

103
0:04:29,320 --> 0:04:30,320
about 1%.

104
0:04:30,320 --> 0:04:33,320
This is creeped up to about 2.2%.

105
0:04:33,320 --> 0:04:35,320
So if a child gets COVID,

106
0:04:35,320 --> 0:04:38,320
so COVID child's case about one in 50

107
0:04:38,320 --> 0:04:40,320
of ending up in the hospital,

108
0:04:40,320 --> 0:04:43,320
that's not what I think we all thought.

109
0:04:43,320 --> 0:04:45,320
We're down to only seven states

110
0:04:45,320 --> 0:04:48,320
that are able to say they have not had a child die of COVID

111
0:04:48,320 --> 0:04:49,320
in their state.

112
0:04:51,320 --> 0:04:53,320
And if you look at the deaths,

113
0:04:53,320 --> 0:04:57,320
we're about for every 10,000 cases in children,

114
0:04:57,320 --> 0:04:58,320
we're seeing a death.

115
0:04:58,320 --> 0:05:03,320
So you could just do the math as we approach 200,000 cases a week.

116
0:05:03,320 --> 0:05:07,320
We're looking at about 20 children a week dying of COVID.

117
0:05:07,320 --> 0:05:10,320
So I think that it's proper to update this and say,

118
0:05:10,320 --> 0:05:12,320
children are at risk if they get COVID.

119
0:05:12,320 --> 0:05:15,320
Whether or not people want to blame the Delta variant,

120
0:05:15,320 --> 0:05:17,320
say this change something or just say,

121
0:05:17,320 --> 0:05:20,320
we are actually now seeing children getting infected,

122
0:05:20,320 --> 0:05:21,320
it's clear.

123
0:05:21,320 --> 0:05:23,320
Children are at risk of death.

124
0:05:23,320 --> 0:05:25,320
They're certainly at risk of hospitalization.

125
0:05:25,320 --> 0:05:27,320
We're seeing rising numbers.

126
0:05:27,320 --> 0:05:31,320
And children certainly can have prolonged or long COVID

127
0:05:31,320 --> 0:05:33,320
or post-acute squally of COVID.

128
0:05:33,320 --> 0:05:36,320
So I think we've moved to pass that.

129
0:05:36,320 --> 0:05:40,320
And as we open schools, we need to think about what do we do

130
0:05:40,320 --> 0:05:41,320
to keep our children safe.

131
0:05:41,320 --> 0:05:43,320
So all right.

132
0:05:43,320 --> 0:05:47,320
Never miss an opportunity to test.

133
0:05:47,320 --> 0:05:50,320
We did have another preprint looking at the relationship

134
0:05:50,320 --> 0:05:54,320
between viral RNA load, CT values,

135
0:05:54,320 --> 0:05:58,320
and infected vaccinated and infected unvaccinated individuals.

136
0:05:58,320 --> 0:06:03,320
And this was the biological characteristic of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine

137
0:06:03,320 --> 0:06:06,320
breakthrough infections in healthcare workers.

138
0:06:06,320 --> 0:06:10,320
These investigators looked at 161 infections

139
0:06:10,320 --> 0:06:13,320
and fully vaccinated healthcare workers.

140
0:06:13,320 --> 0:06:15,320
The results are still binary,

141
0:06:15,320 --> 0:06:17,320
but there's a sort of a sensitivity issue,

142
0:06:17,320 --> 0:06:20,320
but it's viral isolation or not.

143
0:06:20,320 --> 0:06:24,320
These investigators reported that despite similar CT values,

144
0:06:24,320 --> 0:06:29,320
they found a lower probability of infectious virus detection

145
0:06:29,320 --> 0:06:32,320
and respiratory samples of vaccinated healthcare workers

146
0:06:32,320 --> 0:06:35,320
with infections compared to unvaccinated healthcare workers

147
0:06:35,320 --> 0:06:38,320
with primary SARS-CoV-2 infections.

148
0:06:38,320 --> 0:06:42,320
They also reported that these vaccinated infected healthcare workers,

149
0:06:42,320 --> 0:06:47,320
the CT values decreased through the first three days of illness.

150
0:06:47,320 --> 0:06:51,320
These investigators concluded that data support that SARS-CoV-2,

151
0:06:51,320 --> 0:06:57,320
infectious virus shedding, is probably lower in vaccinated individuals

152
0:06:57,320 --> 0:07:01,320
with infections caused by primarily the delta variant in the study

153
0:07:01,320 --> 0:07:05,320
than in unvaccinated individuals with primary infections.

154
0:07:05,320 --> 0:07:10,320
They also reported that there were no statistically significant differences

155
0:07:10,320 --> 0:07:13,320
in the CT values between healthcare workers immunized

156
0:07:13,320 --> 0:07:16,320
with the four different vaccines.

157
0:07:16,320 --> 0:07:20,320
I know the J&J folks always feel like we're leaving them out,

158
0:07:20,320 --> 0:07:23,320
but here they were seeing parity.

159
0:07:23,320 --> 0:07:28,320
Vincent, do you have any comments on this?

160
0:07:28,320 --> 0:07:32,320
So it doesn't have the quantitation that I want, right?

161
0:07:32,320 --> 0:07:33,320
Yeah.

162
0:07:33,320 --> 0:07:35,320
That I want to, that we want, yes.

163
0:07:35,320 --> 0:07:36,320
That we want.

164
0:07:36,320 --> 0:07:38,320
And that's hard to do.

165
0:07:38,320 --> 0:07:43,320
But instead, the paper depends on statistical procedures to draw its conclusions.

166
0:07:43,320 --> 0:07:47,320
And if you look at some of the comments on the Med Archive site,

167
0:07:47,320 --> 0:07:52,320
I think this paper can be helped by some peer review.

168
0:07:52,320 --> 0:07:53,320
Yeah, I think that's fair.

169
0:07:53,320 --> 0:07:57,320
I mean, we really, you know, what do we want for our listeners to clarify?

170
0:07:57,320 --> 0:08:02,320
We would like to see quantification, not a binary assessment of

171
0:08:02,320 --> 0:08:05,320
isolation or not.

172
0:08:05,320 --> 0:08:09,320
But, you know, I think that, you know, I think the Singapore study was the most,

173
0:08:09,320 --> 0:08:11,320
the Singapore paper was the most reassuring to me.

174
0:08:11,320 --> 0:08:15,320
Even if you have similar CT values, it is for a shorter duration.

175
0:08:15,320 --> 0:08:21,320
So I think we can at least already say a vaccinated person is a lower risk of getting infected.

176
0:08:21,320 --> 0:08:25,320
If they are infected, it's for a shorter period of time that they appear to be infectious.

177
0:08:25,320 --> 0:08:27,320
So I am reassured.

178
0:08:27,320 --> 0:08:28,320
All right.

179
0:08:28,320 --> 0:08:32,320
Another topic that I get asked about actually quite a bit.

180
0:08:32,320 --> 0:08:38,320
And we had the original peer reviewed investigation addressing this issue.

181
0:08:38,320 --> 0:08:45,320
COVID-19 transmission dynamics among close contacts of index patients with COVID-19,

182
0:08:45,320 --> 0:08:51,320
a population based cohort study in Zagieg province, China.

183
0:08:51,320 --> 0:08:54,320
This was in JAMA internal medicine.

184
0:08:54,320 --> 0:08:57,320
And this is really looking at a contact tracing.

185
0:08:57,320 --> 0:09:00,320
And when are we seeing transmission?

186
0:09:00,320 --> 0:09:06,320
And this study used a population based cohort of 730 individuals.

187
0:09:06,320 --> 0:09:08,320
These were your index patients.

188
0:09:08,320 --> 0:09:16,320
They had received a diagnosis of COVID-19 in China between January 8th and July 30th, 2020.

189
0:09:16,320 --> 0:09:21,320
And they had a contact tracing surveillance program.

190
0:09:21,320 --> 0:09:24,320
So this was actually quite a massive undertaking.

191
0:09:24,320 --> 0:09:33,320
Field workers visited 8,852 close contacts of the index patients and evaluated these contacts

192
0:09:33,320 --> 0:09:37,320
for COVID-19 through August 2020, right?

193
0:09:37,320 --> 0:09:39,320
So you got to follow a little bit afterwards.

194
0:09:39,320 --> 0:09:45,320
And then a timeline was constructed to characterize different exposure periods between the index patients

195
0:09:45,320 --> 0:09:46,320
and their contacts, right?

196
0:09:46,320 --> 0:09:52,320
So we're trying to ask this question based on the study, when are people who are infected,

197
0:09:52,320 --> 0:09:55,320
who get infected, when are they transmitting to others?

198
0:09:55,320 --> 0:10:02,320
So the primary outcome was the attack rate of COVID-19 defined as a total number of new COVID-19 cases

199
0:10:02,320 --> 0:10:08,320
diagnosed among contacts of index patients divided by the total number of exposed contacts.

200
0:10:08,320 --> 0:10:14,320
A secondary outcome was asymptomatic clinical presentation among infected contacts.

201
0:10:14,320 --> 0:10:19,320
Relative risks were calculated to investigate risk factors for COVID-19 among contacts

202
0:10:19,320 --> 0:10:23,320
and asymptomatic clinical presentation among infected contacts.

203
0:10:23,320 --> 0:10:31,320
So among these 8,852 close contacts of the 730 index patients,

204
0:10:31,320 --> 0:10:37,320
contacts were at highest risk if they were exposed between two days before

205
0:10:37,320 --> 0:10:43,320
and three days after the index patient's symptom onset peaking at day zero.

206
0:10:43,320 --> 0:10:48,320
Compared with being exposed to an index, asymptomatic index patient,

207
0:10:48,320 --> 0:10:53,320
the risk of COVID-19 among contacts was higher when they were exposed to index patients

208
0:10:53,320 --> 0:10:57,320
with mild or moderate disease, right?

209
0:10:57,320 --> 0:11:04,320
And this was about a 4.3 adjusted relative risk, which I think is actually a couple of things

210
0:11:04,320 --> 0:11:07,320
we're getting from this study.

211
0:11:07,320 --> 0:11:11,320
One is I think we're really seeing confirmation that two days before,

212
0:11:11,320 --> 0:11:14,320
three days after is really this peak risk.

213
0:11:14,320 --> 0:11:18,320
We're also, and it may be this makes sense, but this is just one study,

214
0:11:18,320 --> 0:11:23,320
that a person with symptoms appear to be more likely to transmit it to someone

215
0:11:23,320 --> 0:11:25,320
than an asymptomatic person.

216
0:11:25,320 --> 0:11:28,320
But remember that two days before is the pre-symptomatic period.

217
0:11:28,320 --> 0:11:30,320
So we sort of add that.

218
0:11:30,320 --> 0:11:35,320
But there continues to be this whole discussion about how long do we isolate the infected, right?

219
0:11:35,320 --> 0:11:38,320
Quarantine the exposed, isolation infected.

220
0:11:38,320 --> 0:11:43,320
And one of the things that people keep asking me is we have data like this.

221
0:11:43,320 --> 0:11:47,320
Now we have the Singapore study, people who are vaccinated.

222
0:11:47,320 --> 0:11:51,320
If they get a positive PCR test and they're asymptomatic,

223
0:11:51,320 --> 0:11:55,320
do they really need to isolate for 10 days from that positive test?

224
0:11:55,320 --> 0:12:01,320
So we still need more data, but I could see this evolving over time.

225
0:12:01,320 --> 0:12:03,320
So we'll keep an eye on this.

226
0:12:03,320 --> 0:12:05,320
Mention, any comments or just.

227
0:12:05,320 --> 0:12:08,320
This is an interesting conclusion.

228
0:12:08,320 --> 0:12:13,320
They say that if you had an asymptomatic infection,

229
0:12:13,320 --> 0:12:19,320
you're more likely to transmit it to someone who's going to get an asymptomatic infection, right?

230
0:12:19,320 --> 0:12:21,320
Yeah, I didn't even go there.

231
0:12:21,320 --> 0:12:23,320
I ignored that part.

232
0:12:23,320 --> 0:12:26,320
I find that difficult to understand, right?

233
0:12:26,320 --> 0:12:28,320
Yeah, I didn't go there.

234
0:12:28,320 --> 0:12:34,320
And the reason I didn't is what they seem to be suggesting was this idea of inoculum.

235
0:12:34,320 --> 0:12:36,320
They had this idea, right?

236
0:12:36,320 --> 0:12:39,320
That if you've got a lower inoculum, you might end up with an asymptomatic.

237
0:12:39,320 --> 0:12:40,320
Yeah.

238
0:12:40,320 --> 0:12:42,320
If you had a higher inoculum, I didn't know if that.

239
0:12:42,320 --> 0:12:44,320
So I didn't take that as a takeaway.

240
0:12:44,320 --> 0:12:47,320
I thought the two days before, three days after it.

241
0:12:47,320 --> 0:12:48,320
Yeah, I think that's strong.

242
0:12:48,320 --> 0:12:50,320
Yeah, I agree.

243
0:12:50,320 --> 0:12:51,320
All right.

244
0:12:51,320 --> 0:12:56,320
Active vaccination never missed an opportunity to vaccinate and vaccination is how this pandemic gets.

245
0:12:56,320 --> 0:13:00,320
So Monday, August 23rd, we had the announcement.

246
0:13:00,320 --> 0:13:05,320
The U.S. FDA approved the first COVID-19 vaccine.

247
0:13:05,320 --> 0:13:09,320
The vaccine has been known as the Pfizer biotech COVID-19 vaccine.

248
0:13:09,320 --> 0:13:13,320
And now we'll be marketed as, are we ready?

249
0:13:13,320 --> 0:13:15,320
Co-mere-natic.

250
0:13:15,320 --> 0:13:17,320
I don't see that.

251
0:13:17,320 --> 0:13:19,320
I don't see anyone changing.

252
0:13:19,320 --> 0:13:21,320
Who came up with this?

253
0:13:21,320 --> 0:13:22,320
No one called me.

254
0:13:22,320 --> 0:13:26,320
I remember they used to call me when they were going to name drugs like, you know, Dr. Griffin.

255
0:13:26,320 --> 0:13:29,320
Does this make you think of a sports car or a family sedan?

256
0:13:29,320 --> 0:13:34,320
You know, and they had all kinds of ideas, but I don't get this.

257
0:13:34,320 --> 0:13:35,320
I don't see it working.

258
0:13:35,320 --> 0:13:41,320
I don't see my, I don't even seem personally me remembering co-mere-natic.

259
0:13:41,320 --> 0:13:45,320
So I think anyway, okay.

260
0:13:45,320 --> 0:13:50,320
For prevention of COVID-19 disease, an individual 16 years of age and older, right?

261
0:13:50,320 --> 0:13:53,320
So full licensure is what we're seeing.

262
0:13:53,320 --> 0:14:01,320
We still have the EUA continues to be available under EUA for individuals 12 through 15 years of age.

263
0:14:01,320 --> 0:14:08,320
And they threw in and for the administration of a third dose in certain immunocompromised individuals still under EUA.

264
0:14:08,320 --> 0:14:11,320
That's not under the full licensure.

265
0:14:11,320 --> 0:14:18,320
Now, we got also the impact of vaccination on hospitalizations continues to be robust.

266
0:14:18,320 --> 0:14:24,320
And I'm going to, going to throw some information here from the Peterson Kaiser Family Foundation.

267
0:14:24,320 --> 0:14:34,320
98.3% of people hospitalized with a COVID-19 diagnosis between May and July 2021 were unvaccinated.

268
0:14:34,320 --> 0:14:40,320
And this cost us an extra $2.3 billion at a national level in healthcare spending.

269
0:14:40,320 --> 0:14:45,320
And the average personal out of pocket cost was $1,300.

270
0:14:45,320 --> 0:14:57,320
So just to sort of a couple of things I want to get out here, one is we're at a point now where the majority of people that end up in the hospital are the unvaccinated.

271
0:14:57,320 --> 0:15:02,320
It's a huge expense to our country. I mean, this is costing us billions of dollars.

272
0:15:02,320 --> 0:15:14,320
But also these people, individuals who take the chance and decide to go unvaccinated, they may end up, you know, instead of a free vaccine paying $1,300 out of pocket.

273
0:15:14,320 --> 0:15:19,320
And I know a lot of the Kaiser Foundation people actually listened to our podcast.

274
0:15:19,320 --> 0:15:22,320
So I thank you and I appreciate this data.

275
0:15:22,320 --> 0:15:30,320
But I want to go in a direction here in a sense to prepare people for what I think we will be seeing in the future.

276
0:15:30,320 --> 0:15:34,320
So I don't want people to keep asking like, oh, is this still true?

277
0:15:34,320 --> 0:15:41,320
Is it still true that the majority of individuals getting hospitalized are unvaccinated?

278
0:15:41,320 --> 0:15:46,320
Because at some point, I hope the majority of people are vaccinated.

279
0:15:46,320 --> 0:15:53,320
And thus it should be pretty rare to find an unvaccinated person anywhere, including the hospital, right?

280
0:15:53,320 --> 0:16:05,320
If we have vaccinated the majority of our highest risk population, that's the population that even though vaccination is going to reduce that risk, they are the ones that are at risk.

281
0:16:05,320 --> 0:16:15,320
So I want to bring up a next article which was in the MMWR where we're looking at an area with very high vaccination coverage in the most vulnerable.

282
0:16:15,320 --> 0:16:27,320
And so this was an MMWR early release, SARS-CoV-2 infections and hospitalizations among persons aged greater or equal to 16 years by vaccination status.

283
0:16:27,320 --> 0:16:33,320
Los Angeles County, California, May 1 through July 25, 2021.

284
0:16:33,320 --> 0:16:41,320
So here are the authors looked at an area with high vaccination rates, as I mentioned, particularly in the highest risk populations.

285
0:16:41,320 --> 0:16:52,320
During May 1 to July 25, 2021, among the 43,127 SARS-CoV-2 infections in residents of Los Angeles County,

286
0:16:52,320 --> 0:17:04,320
25% were in fully vaccinated persons, 3.3% were in partially vaccinated persons, and 71.4% were in unvaccinated persons, right?

287
0:17:04,320 --> 0:17:11,320
So people might look at this and say, Oh my gosh, we are seeing more infections in fully vaccinated persons, which I expect.

288
0:17:11,320 --> 0:17:14,320
And the more we vaccinate, the more we see.

289
0:17:14,320 --> 0:17:16,320
But here's the critical.

290
0:17:16,320 --> 0:17:25,320
They reported that unvaccinated persons, people, were 4.9 times as likely to get infected.

291
0:17:25,320 --> 0:17:26,320
That's interesting.

292
0:17:26,320 --> 0:17:30,320
This is this new superpower of vaccine protecting us against infection.

293
0:17:30,320 --> 0:17:37,320
But here's the proof of the pudding, 29.2 times as likely to end up in the hospital.

294
0:17:37,320 --> 0:17:39,320
So let's round that to 30.

295
0:17:39,320 --> 0:17:47,320
One vaccinated person is 30 times as likely as a similar vaccinated person to end up in the hospital.

296
0:17:47,320 --> 0:17:54,320
So I think it's critical to realize now that vaccinated people, they still get infected.

297
0:17:54,320 --> 0:17:57,320
They still can end up with long COVID.

298
0:17:57,320 --> 0:17:59,320
They still could get hospitalized.

299
0:17:59,320 --> 0:18:00,320
They still might die.

300
0:18:00,320 --> 0:18:03,320
But vaccines greatly reduce that risk.

301
0:18:03,320 --> 0:18:14,320
So people to start thinking and don't keep asking for that number, what percentage of the people that you're seeing in the hospital are unvaccinated versus vaccinated because I want that number to change.

302
0:18:14,320 --> 0:18:20,320
I want us to continue to vaccinate over a million people a day, which we're doing again here in the US.

303
0:18:20,320 --> 0:18:26,320
And I really think we need to focus on getting everyone vaccinated.

304
0:18:26,320 --> 0:18:36,320
Now, I've been saying for a while that this pandemic is being driven by people not getting the first two doses, rather than people not getting a third dose.

305
0:18:36,320 --> 0:18:38,320
And the whole booster conversation continues.

306
0:18:38,320 --> 0:18:41,320
So I'm going to use this as an opportunity to plug.

307
0:18:41,320 --> 0:18:56,320
Twiv, 796, the very hungry spike with Paul Venus and Theodora Hatzino.

308
0:18:56,320 --> 0:19:02,320
I'm going to work on that, because I have to say I really enjoyed Theodora's comments.

309
0:19:02,320 --> 0:19:12,320
But this is a great, really great discussion in depth about the booster issue.

310
0:19:12,320 --> 0:19:17,320
So, you know, when you're done listening to me, go listen to Twiv, 796.

311
0:19:17,320 --> 0:19:19,320
It is really worth your time.

312
0:19:19,320 --> 0:19:25,320
Now, what are the things I will touch on is what is the game plan with boosters?

313
0:19:25,320 --> 0:19:33,320
Are we going to try to keep those antibody levels high to try to boost this new superpower of protection against infection?

314
0:19:33,320 --> 0:19:52,320
Are we going to try to do this every falls that we go into the winter with our population temporarily boosted, or is instead this a change of our vaccination from a two dose to a three dose vaccine with or without periodic boosts.

315
0:19:52,320 --> 0:20:00,320
There was a preprint, a third COVID-19 vaccine shot markedly boost neutralizing antibody potency and breath.

316
0:20:00,320 --> 0:20:08,320
This was posted by David host group at Columbia that prestigious university in the upper west side of New York City.

317
0:20:08,320 --> 0:20:18,320
The idea is that perhaps we rushed that first boost to quickly get to a level of protection, you know, something we desperately needed in the pandemic.

318
0:20:18,320 --> 0:20:28,320
And that if we waited and got a third dose, sort of a second boost, this might give us a broader and more durable level of protection.

319
0:20:28,320 --> 0:20:31,320
We certainly can't predict the future.

320
0:20:31,320 --> 0:20:39,320
You know, and we are the US is moving forward. It appears with this third dose. But what did they find? This was a heterologous boost.

321
0:20:39,320 --> 0:20:50,320
So this was first the M RNA vaccine to doses. And then they got the J and J. So they had no vector. They looked at four healthy individuals.

322
0:20:50,320 --> 0:21:04,320
And they did find that this approach boosted anybody titers, and they also reported that the level of neutralizing antibodies against all circulating variants was boosted as well.

323
0:21:04,320 --> 0:21:11,320
So this is happening, I guess. Vincent, you have any comments?

324
0:21:11,320 --> 0:21:18,320
Well, really what's important is I don't care about the neutralization titer. I want to know protection against disease, right?

325
0:21:18,320 --> 0:21:27,320
Yeah. And I think we've talked and it's reassuring. The vaccines are continuing to be really effective, to be honest.

326
0:21:27,320 --> 0:21:34,320
This, you know, I was hanging out with my dad, right, last few days, you know, and he's reading the headlines, which I think are misleading.

327
0:21:34,320 --> 0:21:41,320
And, you know, and he says, Oh, I just read, Oh, that the vaccines are losing effectiveness. And I said, Dad, actually calm pop.

328
0:21:41,320 --> 0:21:48,320
So pop, they're losing effectiveness against what he's like, I don't know what they're supposed to do.

329
0:21:48,320 --> 0:21:58,320
I was like, that's the point. And I'm going to annoy you for a minute because I'm going to, we're going to go with that. But yeah, they were studied to protect against disease, death, hospitalizations.

330
0:21:58,320 --> 0:22:06,320
This is a new superpower that we've discovered. And now we're saying, Oh, they're not doing the superpower as well anymore. So, all right.

331
0:22:06,320 --> 0:22:13,320
That ship has sailed, as they say. But we'll continue with the education. Now, what about the J and J vaccine, right?

332
0:22:13,320 --> 0:22:22,320
The poor J and J people. I see a lot of sort of bitterness, people saying, I was told that the best vaccine, which was, which was whatever one you could get.

333
0:22:22,320 --> 0:22:37,320
Well, this week, we got a press release from J and J where the company reported interim phase one to a data published in the New England Journal, right?

334
0:22:37,320 --> 0:22:51,320
We went over and discussed that. But in anticipation of the need for boosters, the company conducted two phase one to a studies and individuals previously vaccinated with a single shot vaccine.

335
0:22:51,320 --> 0:23:04,320
And now they're looking at giving a booster dose or a second dose of the Johnson and Johnson. And they report that 28 days after the primary single dose vaccination.

336
0:23:04,320 --> 0:23:16,320
This second shot significantly increases biting anybody responses in the participants. The study is apparently going to be posted on as a preprint.

337
0:23:16,320 --> 0:23:23,320
So, as we get that data, I'll look through it and share that certainly.

338
0:23:23,320 --> 0:23:31,320
All right, period of detectable viral replication, right? This is when you test positive. This is that viral symptom phase.

339
0:23:31,320 --> 0:23:36,320
I like to say the time for monitoring and monoclonals, not the time for antibiotics.

340
0:23:36,320 --> 0:23:39,320
And I have some good news on this run.

341
0:23:39,320 --> 0:23:48,320
Currently, the Health and Human Services Department, I'm going to start with the bad news. We had only been using about 20 or 30,000 doses a week.

342
0:23:48,320 --> 0:23:59,320
When we got to July, we are now we have spiked up to 168,000 doses a week of the Regeneron monoclonal antibody cocktail.

343
0:23:59,320 --> 0:24:05,320
And demand for such a VMAB, right? That's the other monoclonal from the GSK.

344
0:24:05,320 --> 0:24:15,320
That has increased over 300% over the past month. So people are getting it. People are getting the monoclonals. People are asking for it.

345
0:24:15,320 --> 0:24:18,320
Physicians are making sure patients get it.

346
0:24:18,320 --> 0:24:28,320
You know, this is the monoclonal antibodies are the most effective antiviral therapy we have for SARS-CoV-2 right now for people with COVID-19.

347
0:24:28,320 --> 0:24:34,320
We also got some preliminary results of the NIH sponsored phase three active to trial.

348
0:24:34,320 --> 0:24:42,320
And this is another combination of two monoclonals. They looked at over 800 randomized patients.

349
0:24:42,320 --> 0:24:52,320
They gave this combination of its RRI 196. Don't worry. This does not roll off the tongue and VRI 198.

350
0:24:52,320 --> 0:25:00,320
And they looked at the composite endpoint of hospitalization and death. This was reduced by 78%.

351
0:25:00,320 --> 0:25:08,320
They had a p-value of 0.00001. I mean, these are incredibly effective therapies.

352
0:25:08,320 --> 0:25:14,320
I would love to see them move from EUA to full licensure, just like those vaccines.

353
0:25:14,320 --> 0:25:19,320
But I do have a little pet peeve as well as this is going.

354
0:25:19,320 --> 0:25:26,320
You know, we discussed a couple months ago, mid June, the excellent data from the UK recovery trial,

355
0:25:26,320 --> 0:25:32,320
where we know that early on when people were given this late in the ICU, it was not helpful, maybe harmful.

356
0:25:32,320 --> 0:25:41,320
But if you can give this to individuals early at hospital admission, people that show up but are still antibody negative,

357
0:25:41,320 --> 0:25:45,320
there's a 25% reduction in mortality.

358
0:25:45,320 --> 0:25:50,320
And actually, if you look through a lot of our trials, that subset always did well.

359
0:25:50,320 --> 0:25:57,320
So if you look at people who show up without an antibody response, serology negative, there is a mortality reduction.

360
0:25:57,320 --> 0:26:05,320
It's not helpful if the person has already mounted that antibody response. If it's already late, they've been in the ICU on a ventilator for a while.

361
0:26:05,320 --> 0:26:18,320
But, you know, if you look at the EUA, the Regeneron COV, so that CASA RIVA MAB is not authorized currently under the EUA for patients who are hospitalized due to COVID-19.

362
0:26:18,320 --> 0:26:24,320
So that's a bit of a challenge. And we've actually talked about it among, you know, other infectious disease physicians.

363
0:26:24,320 --> 0:26:30,320
You know, here you have a therapy, you have really good data that you can make a difference, that you can reduce mortality,

364
0:26:30,320 --> 0:26:35,320
where limited, the EUA is restricting us. So I know people, the FDA listens.

365
0:26:35,320 --> 0:26:40,320
So we would like a little bit of liberalness to use this effective therapy.

366
0:26:40,320 --> 0:26:44,320
All right, the early inflammatory phase. This is right.

367
0:26:44,320 --> 0:26:50,320
Often when people get hospitalized, I think I've talked about what I call the soft admission.

368
0:26:50,320 --> 0:26:55,320
Someone comes in with an oxygen saturation of maybe 92%.

369
0:26:55,320 --> 0:27:01,320
You know, here in the New York area, a lot of our pro-health urgent cures, we will start them on oral steroids.

370
0:27:01,320 --> 0:27:07,320
A lot of these individuals stay above 90 and can avoid that, what I call the five day remdesivir stay.

371
0:27:07,320 --> 0:27:11,320
Remember, remdesivir's only benefit was reducing hospitalizations.

372
0:27:11,320 --> 0:27:18,320
If you hospitalized someone to give them remdesivir, you've failed to do what remdesivir has been shown to do.

373
0:27:18,320 --> 0:27:27,320
And so if we can save that $3,000, you know, drug use, we can save those hospital beds for people who really need them.

374
0:27:27,320 --> 0:27:31,320
And not just COVID patients, a lot of individuals that need access to the hospital.

375
0:27:31,320 --> 0:27:35,320
So let's try to make some smart decisions there.

376
0:27:35,320 --> 0:27:43,320
Another thing that is challenging in this area is we are now experiencing tosyllizumab shortages in many parts of our country.

377
0:27:43,320 --> 0:27:51,320
So mixed feelings here, it's tremendous that it's now recognized that patients that have been started on steroids,

378
0:27:51,320 --> 0:28:00,320
progress to higher oxygen needs, you can again, seems like a magic number, a 25% mortality reduction by adding tosyllizumab to the right patient at the right time.

379
0:28:00,320 --> 0:28:09,320
So obviously this medicine is being used, but we need to really make sure we're giving it to the right people because we are now with the rising number of cases,

380
0:28:09,320 --> 0:28:16,320
with the rising number of hospitalizations, rising number of people who are beating this criteria, we're running out of drug.

381
0:28:16,320 --> 0:28:22,320
So I am going to jump to the what is going on around the world.

382
0:28:22,320 --> 0:28:25,320
No one is safe until everyone is safe.

383
0:28:25,320 --> 0:28:27,320
And I'm going to close on this section.

384
0:28:27,320 --> 0:28:33,320
My friend Titus Davali, he's a physician in Blantyre.

385
0:28:33,320 --> 0:28:46,320
Actually, I met him at an American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene Meeting, actually one that I drove down with Dixit in his Prius and heard all about the hydragenosome or something along them lines.

386
0:28:46,320 --> 0:28:51,320
I think I blocked it out so that Dixit can tell me the story again because he loves that story.

387
0:28:51,320 --> 0:29:07,320
But Dr. Davali brought to my attention the article dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 exposure in Malawi and blood donors, a retrospective seroprevalence analysis between January 2020 and February 2021.

388
0:29:07,320 --> 0:29:18,320
And there's been lots of questions about what's going on as far as COVID in parts of the world where they have limited vaccinations, lots of speculation on what's going on.

389
0:29:18,320 --> 0:29:30,320
But here the authors measured the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among randomly selected blood donor sera in Malawi from January 2020 to February 2021.

390
0:29:30,320 --> 0:29:36,320
So a total of 3586 samples were selected from the blood donor database.

391
0:29:36,320 --> 0:29:45,320
The seroprevalence approach is really, I think, you know, a very straightforward way to looking at the pandemic, I think, for most of our listeners.

392
0:29:45,320 --> 0:29:51,320
And if you have the time, this is something you can access is, you know, it's posted.

393
0:29:51,320 --> 0:29:53,320
So there's no paywall in the way.

394
0:29:53,320 --> 0:30:04,320
And if you go to figure one, what they did is they looked at each month and what was the SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence percentage in the blood donors at each time.

395
0:30:04,320 --> 0:30:19,320
And basically, by the time you get to this January, February surge, about half of 49.7 of the samples are zero positive. So you can sort of see this surge over time, you know, with a little bit of delay because it takes time there.

396
0:30:19,320 --> 0:30:24,320
Well, I think that's the big challenge ahead of us is vaccinating the world.

397
0:30:24,320 --> 0:30:29,320
And I'm going to remind our listeners. First, thank you for all your support.

398
0:30:29,320 --> 0:30:37,320
We are going to continue through the months of August, September, October, all of the donations made to parasites without borders will be doubled.

399
0:30:37,320 --> 0:30:41,320
We're hoping to get up to $40,000 to support floating doctors.

400
0:30:41,320 --> 0:30:49,320
They're starting to do just like femric in person visits to a lot of these areas that they serve.

401
0:30:49,320 --> 0:30:51,320
And so thank you for helping us.

402
0:30:51,320 --> 0:31:11,320
It's time for some questions for Daniel. You can send yours to Daniel at microbe.tv. Our first is from Marsha, whose 38-year-old son has a condition called seronegative spondyloarthropy, which is related to psorriatic arthritis.

403
0:31:11,320 --> 0:31:25,320
He doesn't have skin symptoms. His rheumatologist recently recommended he began taking humira and immunosuppressant drug to help relieve the pain and limitation of mobility.

404
0:31:25,320 --> 0:31:29,320
He experiences his feet are especially affected, causing pain and difficulty.

405
0:31:29,320 --> 0:31:38,320
Walking, he received two doses of Moderna at the recommended interval, reached the milestone of two weeks beyond the second dose on June 1st.

406
0:31:38,320 --> 0:31:52,320
Two questions. Before beginning to take humira, should he could he get an antibody test quantitative if possible to determine his existing level of immunity from his two dose vaccination and to before beginning to take humira?

407
0:31:52,320 --> 0:32:01,320
Should he have a third dose of vaccine to boost his existing immunity and wait two more weeks before starting humira?

408
0:32:01,320 --> 0:32:14,320
There's a lot in here. For just clarity, this 38-year-old young man has this seronegative spondyloarthopathy, which is spondyloarthopathy.

409
0:32:14,320 --> 0:32:24,320
Think of it as an autoimmune disease. Think of it as an issue where the immune system is triggering this disease, and the way they're fighting is they're using an immunosuppressive drug.

410
0:32:24,320 --> 0:32:38,320
You've near quite popular that interferes with TNF alpha. This is like, I guess I'll say, inflicts a map of some of those drugs, some of our first biologicals that we used in the 90s quite widely.

411
0:32:38,320 --> 0:32:54,320
The concern here is because the immune system is being interfered with, because we are making this gentleman immunosuppressed, is he going to fail to have the same robust response that we would like?

412
0:32:54,320 --> 0:33:08,320
Well, the trick says, and I think we've talked a little bit about this, is that measuring the antibodies is not clearly predictive of what's going on, and the TNF alpha is not purely impacting the B cell.

413
0:33:08,320 --> 0:33:18,320
So, you know, what is the standard and what is the science? So, this is certainly going to be one of the individuals who will be offered a third dose of vaccine going forward.

414
0:33:18,320 --> 0:33:31,320
You do not yet know how much benefit that gives, right? So that science is still being done. We have lots of studies where people have been given a third dose and they measure the antibodies, but we don't know really what that means.

415
0:33:31,320 --> 0:33:42,320
One of the questions you have here, sort of a real like on the ground question is, should there be some sort of timing related to the Ymira so actually a physician calling of mine asked me yesterday.

416
0:33:42,320 --> 0:33:55,320
Really very similar scenario also on Ymira so same drug, and it was a question of timing relative to the dose of vaccine. And two weeks is actually a period of time that we often recommend.

417
0:33:55,320 --> 0:34:02,320
Again, not a lot of science to guide us, really just a sort of understanding of the immune system, trying to separate the immune suppression.

418
0:34:02,320 --> 0:34:12,320
But remember this drug lasts for quite a period of time so that two weeks is sort of a question of, you know, what amount of time is a person willing to be off Ymir?

419
0:34:12,320 --> 0:34:19,320
My friend who's a physician, he's going to go ahead and miss a full cycle so he's actually going to stay off it for.

420
0:34:19,320 --> 0:34:24,320
It's going to be two months right so we're going to skip the one and then he's going to go at eight weeks to the next dose.

421
0:34:24,320 --> 0:34:39,320
Next one is from Doug who writes, I notice you usually talk about the importance of infections after vaccination being classified as either just a positive test or the more important hospitalization or death.

422
0:34:39,320 --> 0:34:55,320
However, when you've compared the rate of reinfection after natural infection versus the rate of infection after vaccination, you only compared positive tests and did not mention if there's a difference in hospitalization or death are those data available.

423
0:34:55,320 --> 0:35:09,320
Yeah, so a lot of people really want to like, you know, sort of head-to-head comparison. What about people that had natural infection? What is their risk, you know, six months, seven months, eight months compared to someone who's been vaccinated?

424
0:35:09,320 --> 0:35:11,320
What is their risk of the different outcomes?

425
0:35:11,320 --> 0:35:22,320
We don't have any really great head-to-head studies. And if you think about sort of hard to do, right? You kind of need to have a cohort of individuals that have natural infection, a cohort of individuals that are vaccinated.

426
0:35:22,320 --> 0:35:32,320
We have great data on the vaccinated individuals, really tremendous data on people with natural infection. What we're seeing is a low risk in the first three months.

427
0:35:32,320 --> 0:35:41,320
And they actually tend to do okay till about six or seven months. That's when we're starting to see this increasing rate of reinfection.

428
0:35:41,320 --> 0:35:46,320
And, you know, what do the variants do relative to that we'll find as we go forward.

429
0:35:46,320 --> 0:35:58,320
I guess what I should say what we do know, and maybe this is the real question, if you had natural infection, should you just, you know, sit back and, you know, trust the protection, or should you get a vaccine?

430
0:35:58,320 --> 0:36:10,320
If you go ahead and decide not to get that vaccine and your buddy gets that vaccine, you are more than twice as likely to end up reinfected than a person who decides to get vaccinated.

431
0:36:10,320 --> 0:36:17,320
Chris writes the Times is reporting that Pfizer could be given full approval on Monday, which we just said it was.

432
0:36:17,320 --> 0:36:28,320
I have seen a lot of discussion on Twitter with conflicting information from people who all have MD in their bio about whether or not it could then be prescribed off label for children.

433
0:36:28,320 --> 0:36:36,320
Can you clarify the facts here? And if it is possible to use it off label, how a pediatrician or parent of a kid less than 12 should think about the risks.

434
0:36:36,320 --> 0:36:43,320
I do not have kids, but a number of my friends do and they're all worried sick about the fall and going back to school.

435
0:36:43,320 --> 0:36:48,320
Yeah, no, this has been quite a discussion in my household, I'll admit.

436
0:36:48,320 --> 0:36:54,320
And what is going here? It's not being recommended for under 12.

437
0:36:54,320 --> 0:36:59,320
And part of the issue is when we look at the ongoing studies, it's not a safety issue.

438
0:36:59,320 --> 0:37:03,320
It's not an efficacy issue. It's an information issue.

439
0:37:03,320 --> 0:37:10,320
You know, when you start getting younger, small children are not just small adults. They have a different physiology.

440
0:37:10,320 --> 0:37:15,320
They are smaller. They may actually end up benefiting from a dose reduction.

441
0:37:15,320 --> 0:37:18,320
They end up with a different dose than what we're using in adults.

442
0:37:18,320 --> 0:37:26,320
Those studies are ongoing. The FDA has added so that when we do move forward here, the timing is terrible. I admit that.

443
0:37:26,320 --> 0:37:36,320
Now, what if someone, let's say someone is 11 years old and they're going to turn 12 and they're a couple months away, but, you know, they're 100 pounds or 150 pounds.

444
0:37:36,320 --> 0:37:47,320
There is a little bit of discretion there right at the edge, but none of us are encouraging like four or five, six year olds to start getting vaccinated just because the license has gone.

445
0:37:47,320 --> 0:37:51,320
So, so I think there's going to be a lively discussion here.

446
0:37:51,320 --> 0:38:01,320
It is very frustrating as we see a growing number of children getting infected, a growing number of children getting hospitalized as we're seeing a couple of kids, two to three dying a day.

447
0:38:01,320 --> 0:38:11,320
This is not great. I understand a lot of people wanting to be able to move forward. We've got to continue to keep those kids safe a little bit longer until we really have the science and knowledge.

448
0:38:11,320 --> 0:38:22,320
Even if there is an uncommon side effect, we need to be all ready to recognize it so that it becomes just something minor or something that we can address rather than becoming something more significant.

449
0:38:22,320 --> 0:38:39,320
But in reality, Daniel, what's to stop a physician from giving this off label to a kid? Yeah, in all honesty, the majority of therapeutics that we offer to children have never been formally tested do not have in the package insert.

450
0:38:39,320 --> 0:38:43,320
So, no, this is actually the way medicine works.

451
0:38:43,320 --> 0:38:58,320
One more from Abby. I have two kids for an 18 months. Their pediatrician told me that it would be March before they could be vaccinated. I learned that there's a phase two, three local trial of Moderna vaccine in ages six months to 11 years.

452
0:38:58,320 --> 0:39:10,320
With community transmission increasing in our area. I feel that the risk of contracting COVID is higher than the risk of the vaccine, causing a very negative reaction, but it's hard to tell how safe are faced to three trials.

453
0:39:10,320 --> 0:39:18,320
I understand they may get the placebo, but other than that, do you have a sense of the likelihood of severe reactions as a parent? Would you enroll your child in one?

454
0:39:18,320 --> 0:39:27,320
Yeah, maybe I'll start with the last question. So yes, I would, actually, because we clearly know the impact of COVID. COVID is bad.

455
0:39:27,320 --> 0:39:44,320
The vaccines, we've given these to millions, hundreds of millions of individuals, getting down to like 12 year olds. We have ongoing trials looking at younger individuals. If I was looking at having to wait that long, looking at waiting through winter.

456
0:39:44,320 --> 0:40:03,320
Yeah, and actually, I've just started to bring this home personally, when, when the vaccines were rolling out and my son Barnaby was too young to be eligible. My wife actually actively investigated enrolling him in a trial so that he could get vaccinated to get that protection potentially 5050 sooner.

457
0:40:03,320 --> 0:40:10,320
Right. We'd know if he's placebo or not. But yeah, and that that so I guess I'll throw all that out there.

458
0:40:10,320 --> 0:40:20,320
Even now, so I would say the risk of a problem is incredibly low because we have so much more experience, much more experience than we had even when we started the adult trials.

459
0:40:20,320 --> 0:40:27,320
That's COVID-19 clinical update number 77 with Dr. Daniel Griffin. Thank you, Daniel.

460
0:40:27,320 --> 0:40:41,320
Oh, thank you. And everyone, be safe.
