0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:06,880
This week in virology, the podcast about viruses, the kind that make you sick.

2
0:00:10,320 --> 0:00:21,120
From Microbe TV, this is Twiv, this week in virology episode 707 recorded on January 14, 2021.

3
0:00:21,680 --> 0:00:27,920
I'm Vincent Rackeniello, and you're listening to the podcast all about viruses. Joining me today

4
0:00:27,920 --> 0:00:34,080
from New York, Daniel Griffin. Hello, everyone. How's it going, Daniel?

5
0:00:35,760 --> 0:00:42,000
Poorly. Poorly is the word, not well on many fronts, but let's get into the weeds.

6
0:00:42,720 --> 0:00:47,440
Start with my quotation. For the world, it is drowning in paper.

7
0:00:50,720 --> 0:00:55,200
I want people to think for just a second, when would someone have made that comment? When would

8
0:00:55,200 --> 0:01:03,760
they have said for the world it is drowning in paper? This is said by Poirot, an Agatha Christie

9
0:01:03,760 --> 0:01:11,840
character in the story, in the book Murder in Mesopotamia, which was written in 1936.

10
0:01:12,560 --> 0:01:17,280
100 years ago, they thought they were drowning in paper. What do we think is happening now?

11
0:01:17,280 --> 0:01:22,880
As we go forward, people will understand why maybe we should call this episode drowning in paper.

12
0:01:22,880 --> 0:01:33,440
On January 8, we saw 307,983 as the daily case count for the U.S. COVID cases.

13
0:01:34,480 --> 0:01:43,920
January 12, we saw 4,447 deaths. People should realize there's a delay. When you see 307,

14
0:01:43,920 --> 0:01:50,480
almost 308,000 cases, two or three weeks later, we're not going to be sitting in only 4,000 deaths.

15
0:01:50,480 --> 0:01:56,640
We're going to be up above 5,000. It's predicting the future based upon what we know.

16
0:01:57,440 --> 0:02:03,760
We really need to start getting this different. A lot of the hospitals, I get regular alerts

17
0:02:03,760 --> 0:02:10,000
every morning. How close are we to that critical census where they can no longer do elective

18
0:02:10,000 --> 0:02:15,760
surgeries. They have to switch over to full crisis pandemic mode. Actually, we're starting

19
0:02:15,760 --> 0:02:23,280
to see hospitals in our area. Basically, reach that. First one just reached it earlier this week.

20
0:02:23,280 --> 0:02:30,240
Another hospital is just a few admissions away from being at that level. For the hospitals,

21
0:02:30,240 --> 0:02:35,600
this is really difficult. This is how they actually keep the doors open, how they keep the finances

22
0:02:35,600 --> 0:02:41,360
out of the red. For a lot of individuals, this is necessary care.

23
0:02:41,360 --> 0:02:51,200
It's a really difficult situation. We're in here. Let's talk a little bit about vaccines.

24
0:02:51,200 --> 0:02:57,520
Can you imagine the topic, the interest, the questions are now flooding in about vaccinations.

25
0:02:58,480 --> 0:03:02,480
I'm going to try to talk about a few things. One of the big things I think I can bring to the

26
0:03:02,480 --> 0:03:07,440
conversation is what's it like on the ground? What are we actually seeing? Not what's being

27
0:03:07,440 --> 0:03:13,040
published, not what's being talked about, but what are we actually seeing? One of the big

28
0:03:13,040 --> 0:03:18,560
conversations when we were looking at how are we physically going to do this was the question of

29
0:03:18,560 --> 0:03:24,960
how will vaccinations impact testing? As mentioned, we have more COVID right now

30
0:03:25,840 --> 0:03:32,960
than we ever had in this country. Testing still is critical. Testing saves lives.

31
0:03:32,960 --> 0:03:39,200
If we stop testing, we miss an opportunity to pull those people out to prevent them from spreading

32
0:03:39,200 --> 0:03:45,600
to others. We also miss an opportunity to diagnose them earlier. Testing is critical.

33
0:03:45,600 --> 0:03:49,120
As we've had a lot of conversations, I'm going to talk about some of those conversations,

34
0:03:49,840 --> 0:03:54,240
there seems to at least be a consensus among the people I've talked to that we need to be really

35
0:03:54,240 --> 0:04:02,720
careful that vaccinations don't cannibalize our testing capacity. Two rules. One is new

36
0:04:02,720 --> 0:04:08,320
and one is one we've held to for a while. One is the vaccination rule, which is never miss an

37
0:04:08,320 --> 0:04:14,240
opportunity to vaccinate. This comes from our pediatrician colleagues. Kids come in,

38
0:04:14,240 --> 0:04:18,960
they've got a little bit of a runny nose. Some providers say, oh, why don't we just wait until

39
0:04:18,960 --> 0:04:23,120
the kid is completely healthy. The child is completely healthy. We're not treating goats here.

40
0:04:26,320 --> 0:04:30,960
If you wait for that child to be completely healthy, you may be waiting a long time,

41
0:04:30,960 --> 0:04:36,320
and then they may come in quite ill with a vaccine preventable illness. One of the mantras in

42
0:04:36,320 --> 0:04:41,120
pediatrics is never miss an opportunity to vaccinate. Every point of care is an opportunity,

43
0:04:41,760 --> 0:04:47,760
and a very similar new rule, which is never miss an opportunity to test. Every time someone

44
0:04:47,760 --> 0:04:53,840
comes has an interaction with a healthcare provider, this is an opportunity to test, to find out if

45
0:04:53,840 --> 0:04:58,960
they're positive and move forward. I'm going to talk a little bit about how this relates to

46
0:04:58,960 --> 0:05:05,520
vaccinations and some of the troubling experiences I've had recently about people getting vaccinated

47
0:05:06,080 --> 0:05:10,400
and then finding out that they're positive. Let me just relate a couple stories. I've talked a

48
0:05:10,400 --> 0:05:15,360
little bit about this, but now I'm seeing it more. Early on, what I was seeing was the

49
0:05:15,360 --> 0:05:22,160
healthcare professionals. They should know better, right? They got their vaccine in some of them in

50
0:05:22,160 --> 0:05:29,680
mid-December, maybe towards the end of December, and then Christmas Day, New Year's Eve or New

51
0:05:29,680 --> 0:05:37,120
Year's Day, exposures a few days later end up sick with COVID. We're certainly seeing people

52
0:05:37,120 --> 0:05:43,600
get vaccinated and then shortly after before they get to that second dose, that 14 days when they

53
0:05:43,600 --> 0:05:50,960
have that protection, getting vaccinated. A lot of this is education, and I know my large audience

54
0:05:50,960 --> 0:05:57,600
is the optimum tri-state, the pro-health care physicians that listen. Really important,

55
0:05:57,600 --> 0:06:01,440
I know that we're trying to get people vaccinated. It's trying to be sort of a throughput there,

56
0:06:02,000 --> 0:06:07,760
but you want to make sure you reinforce because even healthcare providers got the questions

57
0:06:07,760 --> 0:06:12,800
a couple yesterday. I got my vaccine three days later. I went to a restaurant. It was supposed to

58
0:06:12,800 --> 0:06:19,280
be outdoor dining, but then it got cold and the tent sides came down. I realized I was indoors,

59
0:06:19,280 --> 0:06:25,440
and my quick response was, obviously, you got up and left. No, they stayed and had dinner and

60
0:06:25,440 --> 0:06:32,160
wanted to know if there was any protection three days after their vaccine. So big, big to reinforce

61
0:06:32,160 --> 0:06:37,840
here is that we think you're starting to get some protection 10 or 14 days after the first

62
0:06:37,840 --> 0:06:44,080
vaccination. Some of this stuff we're hearing the experience in Israel is a reduction of about

63
0:06:44,080 --> 0:06:50,720
50%. But that doesn't mean 50-50 you're protected. That means we're seeing 50% less infections

64
0:06:50,720 --> 0:06:56,880
with the same exposure. So maybe you do 30 minutes instead of 15 to get infected. We're not really

65
0:06:56,880 --> 0:07:04,320
seeing that protection that we talk about until you are two weeks after the second dose of your

66
0:07:04,320 --> 0:07:11,040
vaccine. And then the protection actually is quite robust, quite impressive. Let's talk about

67
0:07:11,040 --> 0:07:19,520
some new sort of new vaccine results, the interim results of phase one dash two a trial of add 26

68
0:07:19,520 --> 0:07:27,280
COVID-19 vaccine. This was published on the 13th in the New England Journal of Medicine. So Wednesday,

69
0:07:27,280 --> 0:07:32,240
I think our episode is going to drop this Saturday, so the 16th maybe. Now we had this

70
0:07:32,240 --> 0:07:36,400
information from an earlier press release, but now it came out the New England Journal. So we

71
0:07:36,400 --> 0:07:40,480
have the peer reviewed journal. It's interesting. I feel like the media is treating this like

72
0:07:40,480 --> 0:07:48,320
brand new news, which is interesting. But this is a peer reviewed presentation of the Johnson and

73
0:07:48,320 --> 0:07:56,400
Johnson Multi-Center placebo-controlled phase one slash two trial. Looking at a little over 400,

74
0:07:56,400 --> 0:08:03,600
402 randomly assigned healthy adults to receive either a single dose or a two dose schedule

75
0:08:03,600 --> 0:08:11,120
of the Johnson and Johnson ad no vector vaccine. There are three cohorts. We'll talk about cohort

76
0:08:11,120 --> 0:08:20,240
one. These were adults ages 18 to 55 cohort three adults 65 and older. Don't worry, we'll get to

77
0:08:20,240 --> 0:08:28,880
three longer term data looking at single dose and two dose regimen and the two dose regimen

78
0:08:28,880 --> 0:08:34,880
was collected in cohort two. But this is really just looking at cohort one and three, just to let

79
0:08:34,880 --> 0:08:39,920
you know. What were the results that we saw published in the New England Journal? As far as

80
0:08:39,920 --> 0:08:48,400
neutralizing antibody titers, they were detected in 90% or more of all the participants on day 29

81
0:08:48,400 --> 0:08:55,440
after the first vaccine dose and reached 100% by day 57. That's sort of interesting, right? The

82
0:08:55,440 --> 0:09:01,040
titers continuing to rise. This is not quote unquote unique for this vaccine. Other other

83
0:09:01,040 --> 0:09:05,520
vaccines we have out there, you have a continued rise. But just sort of put this, I guess I'll put

84
0:09:05,520 --> 0:09:11,680
it in context of a Moderna. You get your first dose 28 days later, you're getting your second

85
0:09:11,680 --> 0:09:18,400
dose 14 days later. So that puts us at about day 42 compared here to day 57 to get to that level

86
0:09:18,400 --> 0:09:24,160
of protection. So it takes a little bit longer. So the second dose, and I think this is an interesting

87
0:09:24,160 --> 0:09:30,400
issue. This is a vaccine that is looking at coming out as a single dose. The limited data

88
0:09:30,400 --> 0:09:37,840
they talked about in this paper was that a second dose increased the antibody titer by a factor of

89
0:09:37,840 --> 0:09:43,360
about 2.6 to 2.9. Another thing that was interesting in this paper, people are always asking me,

90
0:09:43,360 --> 0:09:48,480
hey, is there an assay for neutralizing antibody responses in this New England Journal article?

91
0:09:48,480 --> 0:09:55,440
The spike binding antibody response or your total antibody actually correlated with neutralizing

92
0:09:55,440 --> 0:09:59,200
antibody. So you don't need that special test. There is a commercially available neutralizing

93
0:09:59,200 --> 0:10:04,800
antibody assay, but you can at least based on this data, just use a normal antibody assay.

94
0:10:05,760 --> 0:10:11,840
They also report CD4 T cell responses. We care about that. Already by day 14, you were showing

95
0:10:11,840 --> 0:10:18,560
you were seeing clear skewing toward the type 1 helper T cells. There was a nice robust CD8 T cell

96
0:10:18,560 --> 0:10:23,680
response. No safety flags, I have to say. There was just the usual fatigue, headache,

97
0:10:23,680 --> 0:10:29,120
myalgia, infection, site pain. Some of the other communications Johnson Johnson has talked about

98
0:10:29,120 --> 0:10:33,680
the fact that this is a platform they've already looked at in over 100,000 people.

99
0:10:34,400 --> 0:10:40,960
So this is reassuring. We expect the phase 3 trial data to come out on Johnson and Johnson

100
0:10:40,960 --> 0:10:47,920
before the end of January. So expect an update on that when it's available probably about two

101
0:10:47,920 --> 0:10:55,840
weeks from now. They are suggesting Johnson and Johnson is suggesting that they will have EUA,

102
0:10:56,320 --> 0:11:01,520
request EUA approval February. This is, I think, the most exciting little tale I'll

103
0:11:01,520 --> 0:11:08,000
set on here. As per their agreement, Operation Worsfie with the US government, by January 1st,

104
0:11:08,000 --> 0:11:16,000
they will deliver 100 million vaccine doses to the US. So this is a huge shot in the arm,

105
0:11:16,000 --> 0:11:21,360
so to speak, as far as vaccine doses being available. A little bit about what we're seeing

106
0:11:21,360 --> 0:11:27,040
on the ground as far as the Pfizer and the Moderna. We are seeing, I think, consistent with the studies

107
0:11:27,760 --> 0:11:34,320
that we are seeing reactogenicity around the first doses. And we are seeing more significant

108
0:11:34,320 --> 0:11:39,200
reactogenicity after the second dose. So a person gets a low-grade temperature elevation,

109
0:11:39,200 --> 0:11:43,600
they feel kind of crummy and tired after the first dose. They may feel a little more crummy,

110
0:11:43,600 --> 0:11:48,080
a little more tired after the second dose. Very few of my colleagues missed work after the first

111
0:11:48,080 --> 0:11:53,280
dose. Several of my colleagues missed work after the second dose. So that's just sort of something

112
0:11:53,280 --> 0:11:58,560
for people to be keeping in mind as far as the timing on when they get their vaccine relative to

113
0:11:59,200 --> 0:12:03,280
what important things they might have to do. And there are a couple interesting things about

114
0:12:03,280 --> 0:12:08,400
this vaccine, right? So we've talked about the fact about 1 in 100,000 are having anaphylactic

115
0:12:08,400 --> 0:12:12,160
reactions, right? Nobody's died. This is something that we can treat and address.

116
0:12:12,720 --> 0:12:18,880
It's required that all the vaccine administration sites have the appropriate therapeutics and

117
0:12:18,880 --> 0:12:26,720
personnel to deal with this. So Benadryl, an EpiPen, IV, from Odedine, steroids, things like that.

118
0:12:26,720 --> 0:12:30,720
An interesting thing that we've been seeing in the Moderna is what I have, I was searching for a name

119
0:12:30,720 --> 0:12:35,440
and I'm going to now call it the seven-day itch. And I think if you listen to the prior

120
0:12:35,440 --> 0:12:40,640
twiv and you can get a sense of how the immune response works, first you have more visceral

121
0:12:40,640 --> 0:12:44,480
terminal center development. And that right about day seven is when you get the local

122
0:12:45,440 --> 0:12:51,360
terminal center production. So about day seven, in a minority of people, we're seeing that the

123
0:12:51,360 --> 0:12:58,160
injection site becomes itchy, erased. There is actually a visible redness in the area.

124
0:12:58,160 --> 0:13:02,160
Got some pictures people keep sending me. Take Benadryl, go to sleep, usually resolves pretty

125
0:13:02,160 --> 0:13:06,800
quickly. And occasionally, if you really check, you can notice that the lymph nodes in the area

126
0:13:06,800 --> 0:13:12,000
are a little bit swollen. And this is all evidence that you're getting that immune response that we

127
0:13:12,000 --> 0:13:18,320
really want. What about eligibility? It has expanded. And this expanded really quickly.

128
0:13:18,320 --> 0:13:23,520
On Monday, it was down to individual 75 and older. And I think a couple hours later, it was

129
0:13:23,520 --> 0:13:31,440
individual 65 and older. And this whole phase one B group, at least in New York, from DC from

130
0:13:31,440 --> 0:13:36,880
the White House, there's been encouragement to across the board really expand access

131
0:13:37,600 --> 0:13:43,120
in response to the fact that way too many doses are sitting in freezer. So now expanded in many

132
0:13:43,120 --> 0:13:49,280
areas to 65 and older, first responders, all the support staff for first responders, you know,

133
0:13:49,280 --> 0:13:57,360
fire, police, investigators, public safety, any sworn civil personnel, anyone involved in corrections,

134
0:13:57,360 --> 0:14:01,600
anyone involved in schools, I think it's anyone who walks close to a school at this point,

135
0:14:02,320 --> 0:14:09,040
anyone who's licensed, registered or involved with child care, people in public transport,

136
0:14:09,840 --> 0:14:16,400
folks in homeless shelters or working there. So they're really, you know, public facing grocery

137
0:14:16,400 --> 0:14:21,200
store workers in person college instructors. I don't know if that counts you, Vincent.

138
0:14:22,960 --> 0:14:26,560
They're also talking about expanding it to high risk medical conditions, people with

139
0:14:26,560 --> 0:14:31,920
high risk medical conditions. The actual details about what those are are unclear. But there's

140
0:14:31,920 --> 0:14:37,680
really a move. And there was a, I'm going to say it was a nice article in Teen Vogue by Priyanka

141
0:14:37,680 --> 0:14:43,360
Bonsell called botching the COVID-19 vaccine rollout in New York. And it was all about trying to

142
0:14:43,360 --> 0:14:50,240
move from this, this sort of threatening, you know, incarceration, carceral type model of we're

143
0:14:50,240 --> 0:14:54,640
going to find you if you have issues to let's really figure out how to get those vaccines into

144
0:14:54,640 --> 0:15:00,480
people's arms and hopefully a more cooperative. What can we do to get it there? And what are

145
0:15:00,480 --> 0:15:04,960
the issues? Like what is happening? What is failing on the ground? So the first is an issue of trust,

146
0:15:04,960 --> 0:15:11,680
right? In December, the Moderna Pfizer companies had promised and actually delivered on this that

147
0:15:11,680 --> 0:15:18,000
they would produce 20 million doses. January, that would go up to 40 million, February,

148
0:15:18,000 --> 0:15:22,080
or up to 80 million. So really going to really going to increase over time. So what happened

149
0:15:22,080 --> 0:15:26,720
with those 20 million doses in December? Well, the first thing is the government held back 10

150
0:15:26,720 --> 0:15:31,600
million, right? So they'd have enough for that second supply should suddenly the skyfall Pfizer

151
0:15:31,600 --> 0:15:37,200
Moderna fail to deliver. So they only sent out 10 million. Once those 10 million ended up mostly

152
0:15:37,200 --> 0:15:41,280
at acute care hospitals, the hospital said, well, we don't trust the government's going to send us

153
0:15:41,280 --> 0:15:45,120
that next shipment. So we're going to take 10 million, we're going to take five million and put

154
0:15:45,120 --> 0:15:50,080
them in the freezer. And then there were only five million vaccines in play. And then they're

155
0:15:50,080 --> 0:15:56,320
trying to in acute care hospitals somehow figure out how to vaccinate, you know, the acute care,

156
0:15:56,320 --> 0:16:05,600
the phase one a prime hospital based ICU, ER, you know, clinicians and staff. There wasn't great

157
0:16:05,600 --> 0:16:11,200
communication. Basically, the vaccines would just show up and suddenly had these vaccines on hand

158
0:16:11,200 --> 0:16:15,600
and you're trying to figure out what to do with them. So there really was a lot of issues here.

159
0:16:16,160 --> 0:16:21,040
A couple things have happened. And I just want to point that this is true. When you see, you know,

160
0:16:21,040 --> 0:16:28,480
Oh, this hospital has has either administered or allocated 62% of their vaccines. They're

161
0:16:28,480 --> 0:16:32,080
counting it twice, right? They give one shot, they say, Oh, we've given one shot, but we've

162
0:16:32,080 --> 0:16:37,360
allocated the other. So you're counting twice that other shot is sitting in the freezer. So a we

163
0:16:37,360 --> 0:16:42,720
did 30, you know, we did 32%. But we're going to count it as 64. That's that's what we're seeing.

164
0:16:42,720 --> 0:16:48,720
There's now been a push from on high. Instead of sitting on half of those vaccines,

165
0:16:49,280 --> 0:16:54,720
all the vaccines are going to start flowing. Pfizer and Moderna are basically saying we can do this.

166
0:16:54,720 --> 0:17:00,400
We're producing these vaccines. And we want to get those into people's arms. There is also,

167
0:17:00,400 --> 0:17:05,440
I got to say, very frustrating on the ground. There's a lot of paperwork. There's more paperwork,

168
0:17:05,440 --> 0:17:10,560
and it takes more time to do the paperwork and the electronic uploading than it takes to do the

169
0:17:10,560 --> 0:17:17,760
vaccine. And I'm just going to provide sort of a personal story. My mom on Monday, she is in her

170
0:17:17,760 --> 0:17:24,800
80s. She went to go get the vaccine. And so, you know, it was a Herculean effort. My mother has

171
0:17:24,800 --> 0:17:30,400
some health issues at the moment. So my wife had to help her. Another individual had to help her.

172
0:17:30,400 --> 0:17:36,480
A big thing getting her out, getting her in a car, getting her to the vaccine site. She got to

173
0:17:36,480 --> 0:17:40,880
the vaccine site. She needed to be helped to finally get to the area where she could get the

174
0:17:40,880 --> 0:17:47,680
vaccine. And they show her the information. And she says, Oh, my, actually, my wife picked up on this.

175
0:17:48,240 --> 0:17:54,240
It has your birthday as 1931. They have your birth date off. So she tells the lady and

176
0:17:54,240 --> 0:18:00,640
laces, Oh, my gosh, we can't vaccinate you. You stay here goes off to find a manager comes back

177
0:18:00,640 --> 0:18:06,800
about 15 minutes later. The entire, you know, the line, the production has stopped. And then they

178
0:18:06,800 --> 0:18:11,520
come up the solution that they're going to put a line through the one put in the correct digit.

179
0:18:12,080 --> 0:18:16,880
My mother will initial it. Now they will vaccinate her. So, you know, we really need

180
0:18:17,680 --> 0:18:22,320
basically a loosening up one of our a couple of our sites. You know, I think I've described

181
0:18:22,320 --> 0:18:28,960
the pro health experience and had issues uploading the HL seven file to the New York state information

182
0:18:28,960 --> 0:18:33,920
immunization system. Their response was, of course, instead of, Hey, we're going to send an IT person.

183
0:18:33,920 --> 0:18:38,160
Let's figure out how to make this happen was we're not sending you any more vaccines until you

184
0:18:38,160 --> 0:18:44,160
fix your IT issue at that site really kind of back to the the team boa article. We need much more

185
0:18:44,160 --> 0:18:50,640
of a cooperative, transparent model. We don't need to worry about HIPAA and paperwork and electronic

186
0:18:50,640 --> 0:18:55,920
uploads. We need to get those vaccines and arms. And I have to say, down here on the ground,

187
0:18:55,920 --> 0:19:00,240
those vaccines are sitting in freezers. There are thousands of vaccines sitting in freezers

188
0:19:00,240 --> 0:19:06,400
here. And there's a lot of organizations that are ready to get those vaccines and arms. We need

189
0:19:06,400 --> 0:19:12,240
to basically hear at sort of a low level need some help there. What about AstraZeneca? People

190
0:19:12,240 --> 0:19:17,040
are asking about that. Why are we not giving this life saving AstraZeneca out there? And I think

191
0:19:17,040 --> 0:19:22,080
I've talked about this a little bit before. AstraZeneca and the FDA have had some challenges. We don't

192
0:19:22,080 --> 0:19:27,120
have the safety. We don't have the efficacy data that the FDA would like to see. And AstraZeneca

193
0:19:27,120 --> 0:19:32,720
has not been as transparent and cooperative as the US FDA would like. And just to point out,

194
0:19:32,720 --> 0:19:37,120
the issue right now is not a shortage of vaccines. It's an issue getting the vaccines we have into

195
0:19:37,120 --> 0:19:42,320
arms. We expect there to be a lot more vaccines to be flowing in the next few months. What about

196
0:19:42,320 --> 0:19:49,440
mutations and variants of interest? And I can't see Vince's face when I say that, but I can just

197
0:19:49,440 --> 0:19:54,480
imagine it. Some interesting issues I'm going to talk about when we get to passive vaccination

198
0:19:54,480 --> 0:20:00,800
there. But this is sort of a growing concern. What is going on here? Do we have surveillance

199
0:20:00,800 --> 0:20:06,400
systems in place that are going to tell us that something is happening? And I think the UK was

200
0:20:06,400 --> 0:20:11,120
doing quite a bit of sequencing. South Africa is doing quite a bit of sequencing. There's a call

201
0:20:11,120 --> 0:20:16,160
to do more sequencing here in the United States, more surveillance so that if there is a change in

202
0:20:16,160 --> 0:20:20,960
the genetic code that results in a change in the amino acid sequence, that results in something

203
0:20:20,960 --> 0:20:27,600
that can affect the biology of the virus. We need to know about it. And I think there's also a

204
0:20:27,600 --> 0:20:34,240
growing appreciation that we maybe were a little bit relaxed in thinking that coronaviruses

205
0:20:34,880 --> 0:20:39,920
didn't change very much. But there's some interesting data now suggesting that

206
0:20:39,920 --> 0:20:47,200
actually over time, coronaviruses can actually change, can adjust their biology. Few vaccine

207
0:20:47,200 --> 0:20:53,280
FAQs, this sort of hit here before we move forward. The big one I get all the time is,

208
0:20:53,280 --> 0:20:59,040
when can I stop wearing my mask? I get vaccinated. Can I stop wearing my mask? And there's a science

209
0:20:59,680 --> 0:21:05,360
and there's a moral aspect to this. And I was giving a talk for the large pro-health

210
0:21:05,360 --> 0:21:09,920
pediatric group a couple of nights ago. I guess it was Tuesday night. And Jay Berger asked this

211
0:21:09,920 --> 0:21:15,680
question and a very pointed question. Dan, once I have my vaccine and you have your vaccine,

212
0:21:16,480 --> 0:21:21,280
and one of our friends has their vaccine, and it's been a couple of weeks, can the three of us

213
0:21:21,280 --> 0:21:29,440
sit in a room together, have a drink, take off those masks? Can we do this in public? Can we do

214
0:21:29,440 --> 0:21:36,160
this when we go to a party, for instance? Well, here's the thing to say. If you've been vaccinated,

215
0:21:37,040 --> 0:21:42,640
it is offering new protection. But there's only preliminary evidence that is decreasing the amount

216
0:21:42,640 --> 0:21:49,280
of virus that you might spread to other people. So getting vaccinated does not mean that you will

217
0:21:49,280 --> 0:21:54,000
not get virus and that you will not potentially spread it to others. The other side of this,

218
0:21:54,000 --> 0:22:00,000
I'll say sort of the moral issue is let's say it's next September, and everyone who wants vaccine

219
0:22:00,000 --> 0:22:06,240
has gotten their vaccine and had that time to develop immunity. And the only people out there

220
0:22:06,240 --> 0:22:12,160
not getting vaccines are people who have decided not to get vaccines. Do the people who've gotten

221
0:22:12,160 --> 0:22:18,640
vaccines? Are they required? Should they still have to wear a mask to protect people who've decided

222
0:22:18,640 --> 0:22:24,000
not to get vaccinated? Now, as a physician in the healthcare setting, I think that we'll have to

223
0:22:24,000 --> 0:22:29,440
continue to wear masks. But if you go to that party, that's much more of a moral decision.

224
0:22:30,560 --> 0:22:36,560
Can I stop getting tested? This relates right to the first one. If you get vaccinated,

225
0:22:38,000 --> 0:22:42,240
it really comes down to the question of what is the point of that test. A lot of settings

226
0:22:42,240 --> 0:22:46,320
require people to get tested on a regular basis. And in those settings, they're actually a lot

227
0:22:46,320 --> 0:22:49,520
more concerned about you getting the virus and spreading it to others. So if you're

228
0:22:49,520 --> 0:22:54,560
working at a long-term care facility, if you're working with patients, if you're working in a

229
0:22:54,560 --> 0:22:58,800
setting where you might expose people who either have not been vaccinated, or I'm going to add

230
0:22:58,800 --> 0:23:03,680
to this group, people who have an issue with mounting an effective response and are still

231
0:23:03,680 --> 0:23:10,560
vulnerable, then the mask wearing continues. How long after an infection can I get the vaccine?

232
0:23:10,560 --> 0:23:15,440
Now, this comes up a lot. Someone gets the infection. It's been about three weeks. They're

233
0:23:15,440 --> 0:23:20,800
feeling better. Can I get the vaccine or do I have to wait three months? The three months

234
0:23:20,800 --> 0:23:25,840
was thrown out for monoclonal antibodies. It was thrown out for a deprioritization when it was

235
0:23:25,840 --> 0:23:30,720
really sort of limited supplies. But we're recommending that if you have access to get

236
0:23:30,720 --> 0:23:35,680
vaccinated, if your ticket comes up, you do not need to wait the three months. You can wait the

237
0:23:35,680 --> 0:23:40,720
three months because we've learned that you're at very low risk of being reinfected in those

238
0:23:40,720 --> 0:23:48,400
three months. Recent study in the UK, maybe I'll get to it, out to six months, about 86%, or 83%

239
0:23:48,400 --> 0:23:52,960
less likely to get infected. So now we've moved not into, do people get reinfected,

240
0:23:53,680 --> 0:23:59,920
but over what course of time, what percent reduction in likelihood of being reinfected do you get?

241
0:23:59,920 --> 0:24:07,680
I always want to make sure I talk about my BAM-Lanny V-Map, BAM-BAM, BAM-Liniva-Map.

242
0:24:07,680 --> 0:24:13,120
I'm just breaking that down into what is the crazy notation. And this is a MAB at the end,

243
0:24:13,120 --> 0:24:19,920
monoclonal antibody, different from an IB inhibitor. I still remember that this week in

244
0:24:19,920 --> 0:24:27,120
parasitism where Vincent and I confused an IB with an AB, very upsetting to me, but we'll move

245
0:24:27,120 --> 0:24:31,760
forward. A couple of things we're seeing here, and this relates back to the variants. There is

246
0:24:31,760 --> 0:24:38,560
some concern with a monoclonal, whether it be a single monoclonal or two monoclonals in a cocktail,

247
0:24:39,280 --> 0:24:46,400
that you are only targeting one or two of what we think are 20 different epitopes, targets on the

248
0:24:46,400 --> 0:24:54,160
spike protein. So this becomes much more of an issue. Will my monoclonal antibodies still work

249
0:24:54,160 --> 0:24:58,960
when there's a change in the genetic code, when there's a change in the spike protein?

250
0:24:58,960 --> 0:25:05,280
I can give you a little bit of data. I will say that Eli Lilly is actively looking at this.

251
0:25:06,320 --> 0:25:13,040
Regeneron with their cocktail is looking at this, the B117, we won't call it the UK variant,

252
0:25:14,000 --> 0:25:18,720
looks like it is not an issue. There might be an issue with one of the epitopes with the

253
0:25:18,720 --> 0:25:24,640
South African variant, but this is the whole concept that we have not just one monoclonal targeting

254
0:25:24,640 --> 0:25:29,440
one site, but we have the ability to use cocktail therapy. This is also really important from a

255
0:25:29,440 --> 0:25:33,440
surveillance point, so at least with some of the companies we're already talking about

256
0:25:34,240 --> 0:25:40,560
starting to do some sequencing of the virus in individuals that do well, in individuals that

257
0:25:40,560 --> 0:25:44,640
don't do well, so that as soon as there starts to be an issue we know, and then really having a

258
0:25:44,640 --> 0:25:48,720
sense of where is the epitope that's being targeted so that we can stay on top of this. We don't want

259
0:25:48,720 --> 0:25:54,320
to start having people fail monoclonal therapy only later to find that we're actually trying to give

260
0:25:54,320 --> 0:26:00,240
a therapy that's binding in epitope, which has now been changed. Early inflammatory phase,

261
0:26:01,120 --> 0:26:08,000
we're learning a little bit more about the encephalitis, and actually it was a nice article in CID,

262
0:26:08,000 --> 0:26:13,280
clinical infectious disease. SARS-CoV-2 encephalitis is a cytokine release syndrome

263
0:26:13,280 --> 0:26:18,640
evidence from cerebral spinal fluid analysis, and actually they went ahead and described that

264
0:26:18,640 --> 0:26:25,840
the encephalitis was associated with glial activation, neuroinflammatory markers, and so

265
0:26:25,840 --> 0:26:30,640
really sort of interesting getting more in the lines of what I think we've thought over time.

266
0:26:30,640 --> 0:26:36,240
People have not really detected virus in the CSF, but it looks like this is an inflammatory

267
0:26:36,240 --> 0:26:41,600
driver here. The multi-inflammatory phase, I want to sort of reinforce what we're seeing here,

268
0:26:41,600 --> 0:26:48,080
is this disease can often, the inflammatory part of this disease, can often be bi-modal.

269
0:26:48,080 --> 0:26:52,320
So people come in, they often come in during that second week, right, when they're starting to

270
0:26:52,320 --> 0:26:57,440
have their early inflammatory phase, starting to have trouble breathing, hypoxic, increased

271
0:26:57,440 --> 0:27:02,320
respiratory rate. We get them through that, we feel like they're better than they go out the door,

272
0:27:02,320 --> 0:27:08,320
but as I've tried to remind people about 10% of people will come back, and they will come back

273
0:27:08,320 --> 0:27:15,120
during this, we'll say, late week three, four, the late or the multi-system inflammatory phase,

274
0:27:15,120 --> 0:27:20,160
and then it's really critical that people appreciate this is when you can either have a

275
0:27:20,160 --> 0:27:25,440
resurgence of the inflammatory response, you can have secondary infections, you can have clots,

276
0:27:25,440 --> 0:27:31,120
you really need to sort this out. Some individuals never even end up in the hospital during the

277
0:27:31,120 --> 0:27:36,800
early inflammatory phase, and we just see them during this late inflammatory phase. So really

278
0:27:36,800 --> 0:27:42,320
critical to do this, again, I'll hit this again, but this is why we don't want to just clap those

279
0:27:42,320 --> 0:27:46,960
folks out the door, we want to make sure they have good close follow-up so that if they have an issue,

280
0:27:47,600 --> 0:27:54,800
they can be treated, they can be linked to care. The tail phase, I always make sure I want to

281
0:27:54,800 --> 0:28:00,560
spend some time on this, but persistent poor health post-COVID-19 is not associated with

282
0:28:00,560 --> 0:28:06,480
respiratory complications or initial disease severity. This was a study out of Ireland and

283
0:28:06,480 --> 0:28:12,480
it actually highlighted that even people with mild outpatient disease can have prolonged issues.

284
0:28:12,480 --> 0:28:16,880
I think that's critical. We talked about an article last time where when people were really ill,

285
0:28:16,880 --> 0:28:22,800
when people were in the ICU, that there actually was an increased risk of cognitive issues

286
0:28:22,800 --> 0:28:28,240
and more severe with more severe disease. Another article in the Lancet, six-month

287
0:28:28,240 --> 0:28:33,200
consequences of COVID-19 in patients discharged from hospital, a cohort study,

288
0:28:33,200 --> 0:28:42,480
and here they looked six months out. And what did they see? Fatigue or muscle weakness in 63%

289
0:28:42,480 --> 0:28:50,960
sleep difficulties, 26% anxiety or depression, 23%. And the median six-minute walking distance,

290
0:28:50,960 --> 0:28:57,760
less than the lower limit of normal in about 20 to 30% of individuals. So just for all the people

291
0:28:57,760 --> 0:29:03,920
that have this idea that you live or you die, unfortunately, this is what I'm quite concerned

292
0:29:03,920 --> 0:29:09,600
about. People talk about economics and we've got to really keep everything open. We really

293
0:29:09,600 --> 0:29:15,920
have to be careful that we're not creating. I mean, I look at that 300,000 individuals who get

294
0:29:15,920 --> 0:29:20,400
infected in one day. What percent of those individuals are going to die? That's one thing.

295
0:29:20,400 --> 0:29:26,080
What percent of those individuals are going to have sleep difficulties, anxiety, depression,

296
0:29:26,080 --> 0:29:33,200
the inability to work, to be productive, and actually even to have social and family interactions.

297
0:29:33,200 --> 0:29:39,600
So really tough here and I want to point that out. And then our fundraiser. We got a little

298
0:29:39,600 --> 0:29:46,560
bit. We're about halfway through January. So we're about three quarters of the way through our

299
0:29:46,560 --> 0:29:52,560
Peace Corps HIV and AIDS program fundraiser. So if you get the time, drop what you're doing,

300
0:29:52,560 --> 0:29:56,480
unless you're driving, don't drop what you're doing. Go to parasiteswithoutboarders.com

301
0:29:56,480 --> 0:30:00,960
and help us continue our work and help us support the Peace Corps.

302
0:30:00,960 --> 0:30:07,520
Daniel, on Monday, New Jersey changed its vaccine regulations to include anyone over 65. Doesn't

303
0:30:07,520 --> 0:30:13,520
matter what you do, anyone. So that's I've got an appointment for next Tuesday because of that.

304
0:30:13,520 --> 0:30:16,400
If I were in New York, probably couldn't get it yet.

305
0:30:17,600 --> 0:30:22,160
No, New York actually is the same. New York has gone 65 and up. Now, you couldn't get

306
0:30:22,160 --> 0:30:26,320
it in New York just because we have issues, not because of an AIDS restriction.

307
0:30:26,320 --> 0:30:33,680
Because you had mentioned student facing educators over 65, but you're saying all 65 and over in

308
0:30:33,680 --> 0:30:38,720
New York as well as New Jersey, right? Yeah, in New York, it first went to 75, very quickly,

309
0:30:38,720 --> 0:30:43,440
went to 65. I didn't realize you were over 65, Vincent, because you look so young and vital.

310
0:30:43,440 --> 0:30:47,520
Thank you very much. Thank you. All right, we have a few email for you. Samantha writes,

311
0:30:47,520 --> 0:30:53,440
I'm a clinical lab scientist in California. I have a question about CT values from PCR testing

312
0:30:53,440 --> 0:30:59,440
in our lab. A few months back, I read that the FDA was forbidden hospital labs from releasing

313
0:30:59,440 --> 0:31:04,720
CT values because they could potentially be misrepresented or could possibly misrepresent

314
0:31:04,720 --> 0:31:10,080
the true patient condition. For example, a good sample versus a poor sample. After listening to

315
0:31:10,080 --> 0:31:14,240
Dr. Griffin's update, it seems as though the FDA has reconsidered its position on CT,

316
0:31:14,240 --> 0:31:20,640
we currently run our SARS-CoV-2 testing on an instrument called BD max. It gives CT values in

317
0:31:20,640 --> 0:31:25,840
the test report, but we report only positive or negative to the providers. We're in the process

318
0:31:25,840 --> 0:31:31,200
of validating a second PCR analyzer made by Perkin Elmer, but I don't know much about it,

319
0:31:31,200 --> 0:31:36,080
except it's more sensitive to smaller amounts of viral RNA than the max. Long story short,

320
0:31:36,080 --> 0:31:40,480
how can we get the CT information out to our medical team with the appropriate interpretive

321
0:31:40,480 --> 0:31:45,520
information to go along with it? I imagine that a majority of our providers won't fully understand

322
0:31:45,520 --> 0:31:51,760
the result that reads something like positive CT 32 or something along those lines. Any input

323
0:31:51,760 --> 0:31:59,680
is appreciated. This is fantastic, and this is why it's so important to talk to people that are

324
0:31:59,680 --> 0:32:05,760
on the ground. When the CDC changed its guidance, when the FDA changed its guidance, they said,

325
0:32:05,760 --> 0:32:10,800
oh, yeah, you're welcome to share this information, and then it was in the New York Times.

326
0:32:11,600 --> 0:32:14,640
And then there was the, oh, yeah, you've been able to share it all along. Well,

327
0:32:14,640 --> 0:32:19,280
that messaging was not clear. The messaging that was out there, the messaging that people

328
0:32:19,280 --> 0:32:25,360
received, was you can't share those CT values. So now the messaging is you can share those CT

329
0:32:25,360 --> 0:32:30,640
values, and the question is, how do you do it? So I do think it's really important that we put

330
0:32:30,640 --> 0:32:37,440
this in the reports. We're super busy. So currently, what I have to do, what a lot of the providers

331
0:32:37,440 --> 0:32:41,360
have to do is we have to pick up the phone. We've got to call molecular. We've got to give them

332
0:32:41,360 --> 0:32:46,080
the information. We've got to get to the right person. It takes a really long time to get that

333
0:32:46,080 --> 0:32:51,520
number. So it would be fantastic to have it in the report. Now, the way results are reported

334
0:32:51,520 --> 0:32:57,280
is really, really interesting. We have sometimes where they do a sputum and they say, oh, normal

335
0:32:57,280 --> 0:33:03,840
floor. And then at some centers in bold, they say MRSA and pseudomonas not detected. And that

336
0:33:03,840 --> 0:33:09,680
sort of gives a little tip to the clinician on what they might do. So my suggestion here,

337
0:33:09,680 --> 0:33:15,360
for all who are listening, go ahead, still reported as positive, but then put in the print below it,

338
0:33:16,160 --> 0:33:21,920
some ranges, a little level, little information about, we are running our cycles out to,

339
0:33:21,920 --> 0:33:27,120
let's say it's 40 cycles, whatever it might be. And then just put what the CT value actually

340
0:33:27,120 --> 0:33:34,240
is. And then, over time, we'll continue to educate, like a viral load with HIV, like a viral load

341
0:33:34,240 --> 0:33:39,920
with hepatitis C, we'll be able to make sense of what those numbers are. It's also critical

342
0:33:39,920 --> 0:33:44,880
that you put in the analyzer, right? Because there is a little variability from center to center,

343
0:33:44,880 --> 0:33:49,520
there's variability from machine to machine. And as long as you know that, oh, this is a

344
0:33:49,520 --> 0:33:54,640
perk at Elmer that was run on, we have the same issues with antibody index, antibody levels,

345
0:33:54,640 --> 0:34:01,760
you know, PT Prothrombin INR. So yeah, I would love that if I'm able to look, and I'm able to

346
0:34:01,760 --> 0:34:07,200
actually see positive negative and then below it can be that CT value. Page writes, Hi, Dr.

347
0:34:07,200 --> 0:34:12,560
Griffin should people who test positive for COVID-19 or had positive antibodies still get vaccinated?

348
0:34:12,560 --> 0:34:18,880
I know the answer is yes, but I want to know why. So yes, the answer is yes. And the reason is,

349
0:34:18,880 --> 0:34:25,680
as we've we've talked about several times, is natural infection provides some natural infection,

350
0:34:25,680 --> 0:34:31,760
provides some protection against reinfection. But it only lasts for a certain period of time.

351
0:34:31,760 --> 0:34:37,520
And over time, your chance of getting reinfected diminishes. It certainly does not provide what

352
0:34:37,520 --> 0:34:45,440
we think is going to be a 94 95% protection out to a year or two, which is what Moderna is starting

353
0:34:45,440 --> 0:34:52,400
to suggest. We don't think it's going to be close to 100% protection against severe COVID.

354
0:34:53,040 --> 0:34:58,000
So the reason you want to get vaccinated is you want that really high level protection

355
0:34:58,640 --> 0:35:04,000
that vaccines can produce, because you do not want to get a second infection. Yes, several of the

356
0:35:04,000 --> 0:35:09,120
second infections have been mild. But I was like to remind people some of those second infections

357
0:35:09,120 --> 0:35:14,720
have been quite severe. We've had people with mild first infection, severe second infection.

358
0:35:14,720 --> 0:35:20,080
I was just doing a talk this afternoon on the call with our urgent care physicians in the

359
0:35:20,080 --> 0:35:26,000
tri-state area. And I was speaking with Bonnie Simmons, and that at some of the sites they had

360
0:35:26,000 --> 0:35:34,960
done I think 5,000 tests. And she was relating one of the sites that is over by the Verrazano

361
0:35:34,960 --> 0:35:43,280
Bridge void any HIPAA violations that one site had done 100 tests. One of it was a family.

362
0:35:43,280 --> 0:35:48,160
The whole family came in and the whole family was sick. They all tested positive. They had

363
0:35:48,160 --> 0:35:54,320
actually been sick and positive at that same facility back in April. So we are certainly seeing

364
0:35:54,320 --> 0:36:00,000
reinfections. Terry writes, Dr. Griffin recently you stated patients who receive monoclonal antibody

365
0:36:00,000 --> 0:36:08,560
infusion for COVID should wait 90 days to get vaccine. What's the harm in getting the vaccine 30 or 60

366
0:36:08,560 --> 0:36:13,120
days after the infusion? I understand the vaccine may not be as effective at producing an immune

367
0:36:13,120 --> 0:36:17,520
response. But aren't you taking a risk of the patient getting reinfected with COVID if you wait

368
0:36:17,520 --> 0:36:24,720
90 days? So this is a fantastic question. And we've actually had individuals, had a husband and

369
0:36:24,720 --> 0:36:30,640
wife where the wife went ahead and she got the monoclonal antibodies. But the husband didn't want

370
0:36:30,640 --> 0:36:39,520
to because he wanted to get vaccinated. It's now in the hospital. And the issue is the monoclonal

371
0:36:39,520 --> 0:36:46,480
antibodies will use bamelinibab, half-life of about 21 days, say, Regeneron, the cocktail,

372
0:36:46,480 --> 0:36:53,200
half-life in the mid-20s. Once you get these antibodies, and this is being studied, but we think

373
0:36:53,200 --> 0:36:59,200
it's true, once you get these antibodies for three months, you have high enough level that we do not

374
0:36:59,200 --> 0:37:06,480
think you can be infected or reinfected. So the idea here is a person gets infected. They get

375
0:37:06,480 --> 0:37:11,200
their monoclonal antibodies. They actually are immunized for three months. And then at the end

376
0:37:11,200 --> 0:37:17,200
of the three months, as I like to point out, there will be less COVID circulating. There will be shorter

377
0:37:17,200 --> 0:37:23,920
lines. So the reason I say waiting is you might as well wait, you're already immune. You've already

378
0:37:23,920 --> 0:37:30,080
been immunized passively. So wait those 90 days, let those antibodies get out of your system,

379
0:37:30,080 --> 0:37:35,360
and then go ahead and get your vaccine. All right, one more because this one is

380
0:37:36,480 --> 0:37:41,520
more of a comment. Hugh writes, thank you for your comments about penalizing versus helping

381
0:37:41,520 --> 0:37:46,720
vaccine administrators. I cringed when I heard Governor Cuomo threaten providers who vaccinated

382
0:37:46,720 --> 0:37:52,160
out of order with $1 million fines and loss of license. Granted, he was worried about the

383
0:37:52,160 --> 0:37:56,800
wealthy and influential jumping the line, the unfairness and the terrible public perception of

384
0:37:56,800 --> 0:38:03,840
that. But such a massive threat also operates in terrorism. It shifts the risk of even inadvertent

385
0:38:03,840 --> 0:38:09,440
error to the providers. What documentation of eligibility must be presented to protect the

386
0:38:09,440 --> 0:38:13,760
provider from this dreadful liability? If I vaccinate someone who is not yet eligible,

387
0:38:13,760 --> 0:38:19,600
is it a status crime, regardless of what the patient said or my intent? Where I in New York,

388
0:38:19,600 --> 0:38:26,720
I might let thought vaccine go to waste rather than risk this wrath. In DC is grocery store

389
0:38:26,720 --> 0:38:32,240
pharmacy had ready vaccine after all the healthcare workers present had been vaccinated. At the end

390
0:38:32,240 --> 0:38:37,120
of the day, rather than let it go, they announced overhead that anyone wanting a vaccination should

391
0:38:37,120 --> 0:38:42,960
report to the pharmacy. We need strong leadership to get through this. We also need thoughtful and

392
0:38:42,960 --> 0:38:50,480
foresightful leaders. Thank you for your updates. Hugh is both an MD and a lawyer.

393
0:38:51,680 --> 0:38:58,960
But no, I appreciate this. We have made it so hard and so difficult and all these trust issues that

394
0:38:59,520 --> 0:39:04,080
the majority of vaccine produced in our country is sitting in freezers. It's not in people's arms.

395
0:39:05,200 --> 0:39:10,400
This carceral approach, it doesn't make sense. The abuse has happened anyway,

396
0:39:10,400 --> 0:39:14,480
and I don't think anyone will get fined. I think we've spent so much time and so much

397
0:39:14,480 --> 0:39:18,800
effort focused on equity and who should be in the front of the line, that the line's not even

398
0:39:18,800 --> 0:39:24,320
moving. There's no point, as I like to say, being 10th in line in a line that is not moving,

399
0:39:24,320 --> 0:39:31,680
I'd rather be 100th in line than a line that is moving really quickly. We really have to ask,

400
0:39:31,680 --> 0:39:37,920
how can we help make this work? We really need to get those lines moving. Instead of addressing

401
0:39:37,920 --> 0:39:43,760
issues with threats, let's address these issues with offers of help. How do we make it work?

402
0:39:45,200 --> 0:39:50,640
It's kind of crazy that not every dose is not in an arm. It's totally crazy.

403
0:39:51,840 --> 0:39:58,640
It is amazing. All right, that is COVID-19 clinical update number 45 with Dr. Daniel Griffin.

404
0:39:58,640 --> 0:40:09,680
Thank you, Daniel. Thank you, Vincent, and everyone, be safe.
