This week in virology, the podcast about viruses, the kind that make you sick.

2
0:00:10,400 --> 0:00:22,320
From Microbe TV, this is Twiv. This week in virology, episode 770, recorded on June 17, 2021.

3
0:00:22,320 --> 0:00:27,200
I'm Vincent Rackenjello, and you're listening to the podcast all about viruses.

4
0:00:27,200 --> 0:00:33,040
Joining me today from New York, Daniel Griffin. Hello, everyone.

5
0:00:34,080 --> 0:00:40,960
Now, 770 is not a plane, isn't Daniel, right? But I like that number. It's a nice, easy to

6
0:00:40,960 --> 0:00:47,920
remember, 770. We'll have to see, do I end up hitting 777? Boy, would that be lucky.

7
0:00:47,920 --> 0:00:53,520
Yeah, that's the big one. I've flown, I flew one of those to Singapore once,

8
0:00:53,520 --> 0:00:58,480
it's amazing plane. It really quiet. No, I miss that. I miss traveling. I miss

9
0:01:00,000 --> 0:01:04,800
getting to all these places. I miss my friends in Panama in Uganda.

10
0:01:05,920 --> 0:01:12,000
Yeah, you miss your cows in Uganda, right? Yes, I do. I'm worried they're not going to

11
0:01:12,000 --> 0:01:16,960
recognize me. And the next time I go in there, instead of getting like nuzzled by Brian,

12
0:01:16,960 --> 0:01:21,760
he might get a horn or something. Yeah, they won't remember you. Yeah, you got to go back.

13
0:01:21,760 --> 0:01:27,680
Maybe next year, you'll be able to go, right? I'm hoping. I'm going to be heading to Ghana in

14
0:01:27,680 --> 0:01:32,960
January, and I hope to be able to figure out a time to get to Uganda. But I have to say,

15
0:01:32,960 --> 0:01:38,080
my friend Titus, who's in Blantire, Malawi, is actually saying things are not so great down

16
0:01:38,080 --> 0:01:43,840
there. They're starting to see what for them is a third surge. So tough times.

17
0:01:43,840 --> 0:01:48,240
Not a lot of vaccination in Africa, right? No, and actually that's what I'm hearing,

18
0:01:48,240 --> 0:01:51,120
is they're having issues with they were allocated certain amounts, and now they're

19
0:01:51,120 --> 0:01:54,560
getting less than even they were allocated, which are already small amounts to begin with.

20
0:01:54,560 --> 0:02:00,640
So it's tough times for my friends there. Well, maybe we can give them our Novavax stockpile,

21
0:02:00,640 --> 0:02:06,160
right? I hope so, actually. Yeah, I think that would be great. All right, well, we've got a lot

22
0:02:06,160 --> 0:02:11,040
to cover today. I remember a few weeks ago, my dad was asking me, really? Is there something new

23
0:02:11,040 --> 0:02:20,080
every week about COVID? And actually, I was on the local news channel on Monday morning

24
0:02:20,080 --> 0:02:24,400
with Elizabeth Heshigan. And actually, she told me at the end, she said she has never gotten

25
0:02:24,400 --> 0:02:30,240
more questions during an appearance than she got during the time I was on. So people have

26
0:02:30,240 --> 0:02:37,120
lots of questions about COVID. So let's start answering them. So let me start with our quotation.

27
0:02:38,080 --> 0:02:43,120
The worst thing we can do right now would be to mistake progress for victory.

28
0:02:43,120 --> 0:02:50,880
And that is our own Andy Slavitt. Andy Slavitt is actually known as the fixer, I say our own,

29
0:02:50,880 --> 0:02:57,440
because he was one of our executives at Optum for a while out in Minnesota. And he was really

30
0:02:57,440 --> 0:03:04,080
instrumental, I think, in a very successful vaccine rollout. But he's actually now going to be a

31
0:03:04,080 --> 0:03:09,840
competing podcaster, Vincent. In the bubble is his podcast. I listened to it regularly,

32
0:03:09,840 --> 0:03:15,440
and I will shout out. It's great. Good stuff. All right, let me give a little bit of an update.

33
0:03:16,320 --> 0:03:22,080
Case rates and deaths are down across the country, getting lower here in New York. We've gotten

34
0:03:22,080 --> 0:03:27,600
over 70% vaccination coverage in New York, not quite as good as 80% up in Vermont,

35
0:03:28,640 --> 0:03:34,080
but still some hotspots. I think everyone is aware of this. And at the risk of controversial,

36
0:03:34,080 --> 0:03:39,520
this tends to correspond with low vaccination rates. Maybe people think there's causality there.

37
0:03:40,640 --> 0:03:46,800
And worldwide, again, it really seems like the same situation. We're seeing numbers come down,

38
0:03:46,800 --> 0:03:52,080
but again, certain areas and again, seems to be corresponding with areas with low access to

39
0:03:52,080 --> 0:03:59,120
vaccinations or low vaccine uptake. We're also seeing another variant, the Delta variant.

40
0:03:59,120 --> 0:04:04,240
And this has been sort of interesting. One of the things that was suggested, and we'll hit a

41
0:04:04,240 --> 0:04:09,760
little bit on this, is that maybe this is a little bit harder to distinguish from other viral infections.

42
0:04:09,760 --> 0:04:15,120
Maybe there's a slight difference in clinical presentation, and we'll hit, it's actually the

43
0:04:15,120 --> 0:04:22,720
Scots in the UK is actually an app, the Zoe app in the UK, where when they're looking at symptom

44
0:04:22,720 --> 0:04:27,520
reporting, it looks like they're seeing more sore throats, more runny noses, less of the

45
0:04:27,520 --> 0:04:32,640
classic presentation. Now, I do a call every week with our urgent care docs. I'm sure some of them

46
0:04:32,640 --> 0:04:38,000
are listening. And among our adult populations, I don't think there's enough of the Delta variant

47
0:04:38,000 --> 0:04:43,200
out there that they've really noticed much difference. But last night, it was on a call with Jay

48
0:04:43,200 --> 0:04:49,200
Berger, the head of our large pediatric group. And they're actually still seeing COVID cases

49
0:04:49,200 --> 0:04:55,200
every week. And he was actually saying, in that population, it's always presented with more of a

50
0:04:55,200 --> 0:05:01,040
sore throat, runny nose. So I don't know if it's so much a variant presenting clinically differently,

51
0:05:01,040 --> 0:05:05,680
or if it's just that people are now seeing it in a younger age group, which for I'll say for the

52
0:05:05,680 --> 0:05:10,960
whole pandemic has always presented in a way really difficult to distinguish. And this is a

53
0:05:10,960 --> 0:05:16,000
question I remember like a year plus ago is actually Dr. Mench, one of the medical directors at a

54
0:05:16,000 --> 0:05:19,920
hospital. And he was going through asking all kinds of questions about, well, how can we tell

55
0:05:19,920 --> 0:05:23,280
whether or not it's COVID versus something else? And I was like, you know what, Dr. Mench,

56
0:05:23,280 --> 0:05:29,760
there is one test. It's called the PCR. And I think we're still there. So a lot of attention

57
0:05:29,760 --> 0:05:35,040
back to the early days of the pandemic, which I hope will position us better for the next

58
0:05:35,040 --> 0:05:41,200
zoonotic pandemic. You know, and a lot of this is when when did when did COVID-19 get

59
0:05:41,760 --> 0:05:48,320
into our country? So one of the publications antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in all of us research

60
0:05:48,320 --> 0:05:54,560
program participants January 2 through March 18, 2020. And this really builds on other work,

61
0:05:54,560 --> 0:05:59,600
including David Hose, serology surveys here in New York City, Washington Heights, Columbia.

62
0:06:00,240 --> 0:06:05,680
And these authors used serum obtained as part of the all of us research program.

63
0:06:05,680 --> 0:06:11,840
This is an observational cohort study that beginning in May 2018 enrolled diverse adults

64
0:06:11,840 --> 0:06:18,080
greater than 18 years of age in the United States from study site locations in all 50 states,

65
0:06:18,080 --> 0:06:24,400
with a goal of enrolling at least a million participants. So relying on serology testing,

66
0:06:24,400 --> 0:06:31,600
these authors reported that they found positive serology for SARS-CoV-2 as early as January 7th

67
0:06:31,600 --> 0:06:38,400
from Illinois, January 8th from Massachusetts, February 3rd from Wisconsin, February 15th from

68
0:06:38,400 --> 0:06:43,840
Pennsylvania, March 6th in Mississippi. And this is really consistent with the paper published

69
0:06:43,840 --> 0:06:49,760
back in the fall serology testing of US blood donations to identify severe acute

70
0:06:49,760 --> 0:06:56,960
respiratory syndrome, coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2, reactive antibodies, December 2019 through January

71
0:06:56,960 --> 0:07:03,920
2020 and CID. And that actually they have reported in that paper on SARS-CoV-2 reactive antibodies

72
0:07:03,920 --> 0:07:10,560
saying they had detected them in 106 blood donations from California, Oregon, and Washington

73
0:07:10,560 --> 0:07:18,320
as early as 13 through 16 December 2019. And among donations occurring in early January in

74
0:07:18,320 --> 0:07:23,680
Connecticut, Iowa, Massachusetts, Michigan, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin. So I think this

75
0:07:24,720 --> 0:07:29,280
really goes back, right? I mean, this keeps coming up. They keep talking about the identification

76
0:07:29,280 --> 0:07:34,880
of this in Wuhan, China. And I hate to say when they identified it in Wuhan, China in December,

77
0:07:34,880 --> 0:07:40,640
it was already here in our country, it looks like. So maybe we should take off our hat and say,

78
0:07:40,640 --> 0:07:44,960
thank you for picking up that something was going on because we had it here in our country already.

79
0:07:46,000 --> 0:07:51,120
There actually was a frontline special, PBS frontline special, the virus, what went wrong.

80
0:07:51,760 --> 0:07:56,160
And you can actually hear the story there. And this was made about a year ago about how here we

81
0:07:56,160 --> 0:08:00,960
were in the United States, seeing lots of patients with unexplained respiratory infections.

82
0:08:00,960 --> 0:08:05,040
We were seeing them in community. We were seeing people dying in the hospitals.

83
0:08:05,040 --> 0:08:09,520
We had suspicions that something was going on. We were desperate to be able to sort this out,

84
0:08:09,520 --> 0:08:14,320
but we had no access to testing. We weren't really able to confirm it and tell us the story here

85
0:08:14,320 --> 0:08:19,680
about how it's actually that Westchester patient that we finally were able to get a test result

86
0:08:19,680 --> 0:08:24,560
on February 29th. But he had been sick for a while. And we sort of later realized, boy,

87
0:08:24,560 --> 0:08:29,520
there were thousands of people that already had COVID-19 here in New York by the time we identified

88
0:08:29,520 --> 0:08:34,720
that gentleman in the end of February. Children in COVID, children are at low risk, but they are

89
0:08:34,720 --> 0:08:40,400
not at no risk. And I know people remember my old mantra, let us open the schools if we need to

90
0:08:40,400 --> 0:08:46,000
close the bars. That's fine. So more on children in COVID. And this will be a little bit of an

91
0:08:46,000 --> 0:08:53,840
overlap from, I guess, 769-12, which covered a little bit new information on the article.

92
0:08:54,400 --> 0:08:59,440
This article I'll be talking about incidents of multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children.

93
0:08:59,440 --> 0:09:06,160
Among U.S. persons infected with SARS-CoV-2. This paper was published in JAMA Network Open,

94
0:09:06,160 --> 0:09:13,520
but there's really nice discussion on 769. Not only just about this issue, but maybe a little

95
0:09:13,520 --> 0:09:21,920
deeper dive into maybe some ideas about gut-tight junctions and super antigens. But this article

96
0:09:21,920 --> 0:09:30,720
was really a look at the incidence of multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children. So Miss C,

97
0:09:30,720 --> 0:09:36,560
in those under 21, should they get COVID? So they looked at data from Connecticut,

98
0:09:36,560 --> 0:09:40,960
Georgia, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York. They excluded New York City,

99
0:09:41,840 --> 0:09:49,040
Pennsylvania. And the data analysis was conducted from August to December 2020. And they actually

100
0:09:49,040 --> 0:09:57,200
reported an incidence of 31.6 persons per 100,000 SARS-CoV-2 infections in persons younger than 21.

101
0:09:57,760 --> 0:10:05,200
So this is about one in every 3,000 children who got COVID ended up with Miss C. They did point

102
0:10:05,200 --> 0:10:11,120
out that the Miss C incidence among black persons, Hispanics, and Latino persons was approximately

103
0:10:11,120 --> 0:10:17,760
nine times higher than among Caucasians, about three times higher among Asian Pacific Islanders.

104
0:10:17,760 --> 0:10:23,280
And so I'll suggest this perhaps a lower risk, right? Because as we've discussed before,

105
0:10:23,280 --> 0:10:27,920
many cases in children do go undiagnosed. I just want to add that caveat. But we're starting to

106
0:10:27,920 --> 0:10:33,200
get a, I think, information here, because parents are trying to decide, should I just wait and let

107
0:10:33,200 --> 0:10:40,000
my child get COVID versus the risk that might be associated with vaccinations? So just putting

108
0:10:40,000 --> 0:10:46,720
that in context. Another paper, and this is going to help us with myocarditis discussions,

109
0:10:46,720 --> 0:10:51,840
this paper was prevalence of clinical and subclinical myocarditis in competitive

110
0:10:51,840 --> 0:10:57,760
athletes with recent SARS-CoV-2 infection results from the Big 10 COVID-19 cardiac

111
0:10:57,760 --> 0:11:04,480
registry, right? So this is our university athletes. We'd heard a little bit about this in preprint,

112
0:11:04,480 --> 0:11:09,840
but now this was published in JAMA cardiology. And I think this can give us some perspective,

113
0:11:09,840 --> 0:11:15,120
as concerns are raised about potential risks of heart inflammation or myocarditis post-vaccination.

114
0:11:15,120 --> 0:11:23,600
So the authors here report on a cohort study of 1,597 U.S. competitive collegiate athletes

115
0:11:24,160 --> 0:11:30,800
undergoing comprehensive cardiovascular testing and the prevalence of clinical myocarditis based

116
0:11:30,800 --> 0:11:38,720
on a symptom screening strategy was 0.31%. If they went ahead and screened with magnetic

117
0:11:38,720 --> 0:11:46,240
resonance imaging, it actually was as high as 2.3%. So this gives us a 1 in 300 chance of

118
0:11:46,240 --> 0:11:52,240
symptomatic myocarditis and about a 1 in 43 chance with sensitive screening should

119
0:11:53,200 --> 0:11:59,920
individual in this age group get COVID. So as I say, this is perhaps a lower risk,

120
0:11:59,920 --> 0:12:06,000
because right as we discussed right above, some cases go undiagnosed, so got to have that caveat.

121
0:12:06,000 --> 0:12:12,320
But I think this gives us perspective to concerns about the post-vaccination myocarditis risk,

122
0:12:12,960 --> 0:12:19,040
of which there are a few hundred cases under investigation. They tend to be mild limited to a

123
0:12:19,040 --> 0:12:24,880
few days versus what we see with the virus here, which has actually resulted in long-term impacts.

124
0:12:24,880 --> 0:12:29,440
We actually know a lot of athletes who actually were not able to actually compete because of the

125
0:12:29,440 --> 0:12:35,760
severity of a post-COVID infection myocarditis. So I think this is just more information

126
0:12:35,760 --> 0:12:41,120
for people to have in the mix when they're making decisions about vaccination. I'm talking my

127
0:12:41,120 --> 0:12:46,080
wife a little bit about the sort of discouraging fact that we're still seeing thousands of COVID

128
0:12:46,080 --> 0:12:52,320
cases every day. Most experts are predicting an increase come fall and winter. So you compare

129
0:12:52,320 --> 0:13:00,000
the risk potential risks associated with vaccination versus the real risks of getting COVID and the

130
0:13:00,000 --> 0:13:04,240
complications that we know about from that. But then balancing the risk and perspectives,

131
0:13:04,240 --> 0:13:10,720
what about the impact of the pandemic on mental health issues here in our adolescents? The

132
0:13:10,720 --> 0:13:17,760
article emergency department visits for suspected suicide attempts among persons age 12 to 25 years

133
0:13:18,320 --> 0:13:26,160
before and during the COVID-19 pandemic United States January 2019 through May 2021. Now this

134
0:13:26,160 --> 0:13:33,520
came out as an early release in the CDC MMWR and the authors reported that in May 2020,

135
0:13:33,520 --> 0:13:39,200
during the COVID-19 pandemic ED visits for suspected suicide attempts began to increase

136
0:13:39,200 --> 0:13:48,080
among adolescents age 12 to 17, especially girls. And during February 21 to March 2021,

137
0:13:48,080 --> 0:13:55,200
suspected suicide attempt ED visits were 50.6% higher among girls age 12 to 17 than during the

138
0:13:55,200 --> 0:14:01,040
same period in 2019 prior to the pandemic. And I really think that if you look at

139
0:14:01,040 --> 0:14:05,840
figure one in this paper, it's very sobering as one can see the weekly ER visits for female

140
0:14:05,840 --> 0:14:12,400
adolescents with suspected suicide attempts rising to over 1000 per week. Now the authors

141
0:14:12,400 --> 0:14:18,160
acknowledge several limitations. First, you know, my first tendency is feel guilty that we

142
0:14:18,160 --> 0:14:22,400
caused this through physical distancing, including a lack of connectedness to schools,

143
0:14:22,400 --> 0:14:28,880
teachers and peers, barriers to mental health treatment, increases in substance use and anxiety

144
0:14:28,880 --> 0:14:34,320
about family health and economic problems, which I think we all experienced. These are all risk

145
0:14:34,320 --> 0:14:40,320
factors just for suicide. But we also have seen that the average ED visits for mental health

146
0:14:40,320 --> 0:14:45,920
concerns and suspected child abuse, neglect, risk factors for suicide attempts also increased

147
0:14:45,920 --> 0:14:52,080
in 2020. The authors, you know, acknowledge that there could be alternative explanations here.

148
0:14:52,080 --> 0:14:59,280
But I've talked a bit with our urgent care physicians. And I think a lot of us, a lot of

149
0:14:59,280 --> 0:15:04,080
people have suggested that both this was very evident that there was a significant impact on

150
0:15:04,080 --> 0:15:08,720
mental health that we didn't really need a publication like this. But others have actually

151
0:15:08,720 --> 0:15:14,160
suggested that there's even a bigger problem than we see here. So many visits to urgent care

152
0:15:14,160 --> 0:15:19,040
centers with cutting and other results of mental health challenges in our children,

153
0:15:19,040 --> 0:15:23,680
children struggling in school, parents frustrated and struggling with often very unhealthy parent

154
0:15:23,680 --> 0:15:30,080
child and even parent dynamics. So I was talking to my friend, Dr. Lucy McBride, sort of a,

155
0:15:30,080 --> 0:15:34,880
I think, a bright light in this spot over the last year, just about how we really need to do

156
0:15:34,880 --> 0:15:41,200
better. Alright, pre-exposure period transmission. This was an interesting correspondence in the

157
0:15:41,200 --> 0:15:49,760
Lancet. SARS-CoV-2 Delta, VOC in Scotland, demographics, risk of hospital admission and vaccine

158
0:15:49,760 --> 0:15:54,800
effectiveness. Now, the authors use the word strain a bun. So I'm going to replace that with

159
0:15:54,800 --> 0:16:03,600
the word variant. They report that on May 19, 2021, the Delta variant of concern for 4 million

160
0:16:03,600 --> 0:16:12,480
known as the Indian VOC or B1.617.2 became the dominant variant of SARS-CoV-2 in Scotland.

161
0:16:13,280 --> 0:16:15,760
I wonder how long it's been like prints, how long we have to, you know,

162
0:16:15,760 --> 0:16:23,760
4 million known as throw in there. But the alpha variant of concern had been dominant previously.

163
0:16:23,760 --> 0:16:29,840
I'm not going to give the AKA there. But this was rapidly replaced. A few interesting findings.

164
0:16:29,840 --> 0:16:36,160
So the Delta variant of concern in Scotland was found mainly in younger, more affluent groups.

165
0:16:36,720 --> 0:16:42,080
Interesting. I'm sure about the affluent part of that. Risk of COVID-19 hospital admission was

166
0:16:42,080 --> 0:16:49,680
approximately doubled in those with the Delta VOC when compared to the alpha VOC. Both the Oxford,

167
0:16:49,680 --> 0:16:55,120
AstraZeneca, and the Pfizer by intact COVID-19 vaccines were effective in reducing the

168
0:16:55,120 --> 0:17:02,480
risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 hospitalization in people with the Delta VOC.

169
0:17:02,480 --> 0:17:07,680
So interesting publication there. All right. Testing never missed an opportunity to test.

170
0:17:08,400 --> 0:17:12,320
This has become a challenging arena and really dealing with false positives,

171
0:17:12,880 --> 0:17:16,880
particularly on asymptomatic screening. So we've done this a few times,

172
0:17:16,880 --> 0:17:21,360
and I'm hoping that clear minds prevail. We get some clinical judgment allowed in terms of

173
0:17:21,360 --> 0:17:29,040
interpretation for our camp, school, and summer programs. So this is the concept of a positive

174
0:17:29,040 --> 0:17:34,320
predictive value and a negative predictive value. So the big message here is that when we get to

175
0:17:34,320 --> 0:17:40,240
a prevalence below 1%, that's where we are in most parts of the country, the majority of those

176
0:17:40,240 --> 0:17:45,600
positive tests are going to be false positives. We're forced in a lot of jurisdictions to still

177
0:17:45,600 --> 0:17:53,360
count any test as positive and follow the rigmarole that follows from that. But we're hoping that

178
0:17:53,360 --> 0:17:58,160
if someone is low-risk, it's screening. You do a secondary confirmatory test that is negative.

179
0:17:58,720 --> 0:18:04,000
We'd love to have just a little bit of flexibility here to use some clinical judgment. But that

180
0:18:04,000 --> 0:18:08,960
is actually what I'm spending a lot of time with. Meetings going through, because there will be.

181
0:18:08,960 --> 0:18:14,000
You do hundreds of tests. You're going to get some positives, and the majority of those are going

182
0:18:14,000 --> 0:18:20,560
to be false positives. All right, active vaccination. Never miss an opportunity to vaccinate. Vaccines

183
0:18:20,560 --> 0:18:29,200
are how this pandemic ends. We heard from Novavax. This was covered on 769. The Novavax COVID-19

184
0:18:29,200 --> 0:18:36,160
vaccine demonstrated 90% overall efficacy and 100% protection against moderate and severe disease

185
0:18:36,160 --> 0:18:44,560
in prevent-19 phase 3 trial. Press release, so we don't have a full peer-reviewed pre-print. But

186
0:18:44,560 --> 0:18:51,760
this is a recombinant nanoparticle protein-based COVID-19 vaccine that uses technology similar to

187
0:18:51,760 --> 0:18:59,440
the current shingles vaccine, shingrix, pertussis, hepatitis B. This, in all honesty, people ask

188
0:18:59,440 --> 0:19:04,800
for, oh, I want a traditional vaccine in many ways. This is. A little bit about the trial,

189
0:19:04,800 --> 0:19:11,840
the catchy name, right? Vincent did a good job of that. Provent stands for the pre-fusion protein

190
0:19:11,840 --> 0:19:19,280
subunit vaccine efficacy Novax trial. This was a two-to-one randomized placebo-controlled

191
0:19:19,280 --> 0:19:27,360
observer-blinded study to evaluate the safety efficacy immunogenicity of this

192
0:19:27,360 --> 0:19:35,840
adjuvanted vaccine in 29,960 participants, 18 years of age and older in 119 locations in the

193
0:19:35,840 --> 0:19:42,400
United States, Mexico, compared with placebo. 70, seven cases were observed, 63 of placebo,

194
0:19:42,400 --> 0:19:47,680
14 in the vaccine group. So remember, this is two-to-one. So you can sort of think of that 63 versus

195
0:19:47,680 --> 0:19:54,080
seven, you know, or 126 versus 14, just to understand why the numbers are what they are.

196
0:19:54,080 --> 0:20:00,720
All cases observed in the vaccine group were mild. 10 moderate cases and four severe cases

197
0:20:00,720 --> 0:20:06,480
were observed all in the placebo group, yielding a vaccine efficacy of 100% against moderate or

198
0:20:06,480 --> 0:20:12,000
severe disease. It's all very positive. Safety data was actually quite positive. And at least

199
0:20:12,000 --> 0:20:17,040
what I have heard is that the people that got the vaccine versus the people that did not get the

200
0:20:17,040 --> 0:20:22,400
vaccine, the degree of reactogenicity was minor enough that people had a tough time telling. So

201
0:20:22,400 --> 0:20:28,560
that will be quite nice if we have a vaccine with a little less reactogenicity. I think it'll be

202
0:20:28,560 --> 0:20:32,240
nice. I'm sure we'll have people wondering if they didn't get placebo in the future. They're

203
0:20:32,240 --> 0:20:36,800
getting used to a nice big reaction. Now they did give us a little bit of information about

204
0:20:36,800 --> 0:20:43,120
variants, but I'm going to sort of leave it there. Another potential great tool for us to have that

205
0:20:43,120 --> 0:20:48,880
looks like it's also efficacious against the variants. All right, pregnant women and vaccination.

206
0:20:48,880 --> 0:20:56,000
It's always a hot topic. CDC MMWR again with COVID-19 vaccination coverage among pregnant women

207
0:20:56,000 --> 0:21:01,440
during pregnancy. That was sort of redundant, but okay. Eight integrated healthcare organizations

208
0:21:01,440 --> 0:21:08,080
U.S. December 14, 2020 through May 8, 2021. And so data from the vaccine safety data link,

209
0:21:08,080 --> 0:21:14,800
so VSD, a collaboration between CDC and multiple integrated health systems was analyzed to assess

210
0:21:14,800 --> 0:21:21,440
those that received greater than one dose or first or second dose of Pfizer BioNTech or Moderna or

211
0:21:21,440 --> 0:21:27,440
single dose of J&J. And basically went through and the really the high point I'm going to say,

212
0:21:27,440 --> 0:21:33,040
they looked at a total of one thousand three one thousand thirty five one hundred and thirty

213
0:21:33,040 --> 0:21:36,960
five thousand yes one hundred and thirty five thousand nine hundred and sixty eight pregnant

214
0:21:36,960 --> 0:21:45,520
women, and they identified no safety concerns. All right, we got more real world data on our

215
0:21:45,520 --> 0:21:51,520
monoclonals. And I like to say the first week, right, the viral symptom phase, the time for

216
0:21:51,520 --> 0:21:56,320
monitoring and monoclonals, and also where you get your test is ideally where you get your monoclonals.

217
0:21:56,960 --> 0:22:02,560
So real world data on bamlin of a map, the article early monoclonal antibody administration

218
0:22:02,560 --> 0:22:09,280
can reduce both hospitalizations and mortality in high-risk outpatients with COVID-19. This was

219
0:22:09,280 --> 0:22:16,400
published in in CID out of UC San Diego at La Jolla. The authors performed a retrospective

220
0:22:16,400 --> 0:22:25,520
review of medical records of patients referred to their clinic from 11 120 to 2 2021 and identified

221
0:22:25,520 --> 0:22:33,920
617 patients at high risk who were offered monoclonal antibodies 175 received them 442 did not.

222
0:22:35,200 --> 0:22:41,040
The monoclonal antibody group was older, more men, more comorbidities, higher risk score,

223
0:22:41,040 --> 0:22:46,960
but despite that there was a significant reduction in hospitalizations in the monoclonal antibody

224
0:22:46,960 --> 0:22:56,160
group versus control 1.7% versus 24%. No COVID-19 related deaths in the monoclonal antibody group,

225
0:22:56,160 --> 0:23:00,960
there were 12 among the controls, which really breaks your heart, right? All these people were

226
0:23:00,960 --> 0:23:07,040
offered monoclonals, a number refused, a dozen of those died as a consequence of that decision.

227
0:23:08,000 --> 0:23:12,320
So I think it's really important for clinicians and patients to realize that particularly in

228
0:23:12,320 --> 0:23:19,680
those unvaccinated monoclonals are a really powerful tool. But now things get a little bit

229
0:23:19,680 --> 0:23:26,080
complicated. This is a twist and I think everyone who is used to everything I've said about monoclonals

230
0:23:26,080 --> 0:23:31,600
and how timing really matters, this is a little nuanced because now we're going to talk about

231
0:23:31,600 --> 0:23:38,800
a subset of hospitalized patients that may actually benefit that do benefit from monoclonal. So we

232
0:23:38,800 --> 0:23:43,840
heard about data from the UK recovery trial. And I have to say, I was very excited about this,

233
0:23:43,840 --> 0:23:47,120
you know, this is stopping people in the hall at the hospital, we got to talk about this.

234
0:23:48,000 --> 0:23:55,120
And this was, we got a press release from Regeneron, Regeneron Cove. So this is the

235
0:23:55,120 --> 0:24:01,760
Casa Veribimab and the MDivimab phase three recovery trial meets primary outcome,

236
0:24:01,760 --> 0:24:08,480
improving survival in hospitalized COVID-19 patients lacking an immune response to SARS-CoV-2.

237
0:24:09,440 --> 0:24:18,000
So the primary outcome was all cause mortality in hospitalized zero negative patients. They

238
0:24:18,000 --> 0:24:24,800
received Regeneron Cove 8000 milligrams versus just usual state of care. And this reduced all

239
0:24:24,800 --> 0:24:35,520
cause mortality by 20% in zero negative patients compared to usual care alone. So 24% of the folks

240
0:24:36,400 --> 0:24:42,160
in the Regeneron COVID arm died versus 30% in the usual care by day 28.

241
0:24:42,880 --> 0:24:47,760
So this is really an important point, right? This is not saying, oh wow, now it works in

242
0:24:47,760 --> 0:24:53,200
hospitalized patients. This is saying that if you give it to people who end up in the hospital,

243
0:24:53,200 --> 0:24:59,760
who missed that first window, remember that first window, nobody died. Here, you still had 24%

244
0:24:59,760 --> 0:25:08,240
of the patients dying. But that was a 20% reduction. When you combine the larger seropositive group,

245
0:25:08,240 --> 0:25:14,160
there was no longer a significant impact. So this is already something where they are looking

246
0:25:14,160 --> 0:25:19,760
for expansion of the EUA. So if a patient shows up in the hospital, maybe their oxygen saturation

247
0:25:19,760 --> 0:25:25,440
is 92, 93, someone might think we need to admit them for a remdesivir or something else. If they

248
0:25:25,440 --> 0:25:31,040
are seronegative, it looks like there still is a benefit in that subgroup to getting Regeneron

249
0:25:31,040 --> 0:25:37,440
cocktail therapy. The median hospital stay was four days shorter, 13 versus 17 in those that

250
0:25:37,440 --> 0:25:42,560
got the cocktail when we're looking at their seronegative group. I'll read there. They had

251
0:25:42,560 --> 0:25:47,680
that quoted summary and this is the takeaway. The recovery trial has shown that in patients who

252
0:25:47,680 --> 0:25:54,160
had not made their own antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 treated with Regeneron-CoV antibodies,

253
0:25:54,160 --> 0:26:00,400
dramatically reduced their risk of dying or being on a ventilator and also shortened how many days

254
0:26:00,400 --> 0:26:08,080
they remained in the hospital. So I think that this is practice changing. But I still will say,

255
0:26:08,080 --> 0:26:13,120
if you can get it in in that first week before they end up in the hospital, we are not seeing

256
0:26:13,120 --> 0:26:18,880
people dying in our trials. We're here a quarter of these people died, but that was less than the

257
0:26:18,880 --> 0:26:25,360
people who do not receive therapy. Long COVID, post COVID, I feel like we're still in a bit of limbo

258
0:26:25,360 --> 0:26:31,920
here, still very limited in what we can offer patients. But we did this week get some guidance

259
0:26:31,920 --> 0:26:37,680
from the CDC. It's both honest, accurate and a start. So let's wrap up today before we get to

260
0:26:37,680 --> 0:26:45,920
emails with some of the key points from the CDC interim guidance on post-acute sequelae of COVID.

261
0:26:45,920 --> 0:26:52,960
So key points, the term post-COVID conditions is an umbrella term for the wide range of physical

262
0:26:52,960 --> 0:26:59,120
and mental health consequences experienced by some patients that are present four or more weeks

263
0:26:59,120 --> 0:27:07,840
after SARS-CoV-2 infection, including by patients who had initial mild or asymptomatic acute infection.

264
0:27:07,840 --> 0:27:14,000
Two, based on current information, many post-COVID conditions can be managed by primary care

265
0:27:14,000 --> 0:27:19,840
providers with the incorporation of patient-centered approaches to optimize the quality of life and

266
0:27:19,840 --> 0:27:25,200
function in affected patients, right? So they're saying here a lot of these people can be managed

267
0:27:25,200 --> 0:27:29,440
by their primary conditions. They do not need to be referred to specialty centers.

268
0:27:30,400 --> 0:27:35,920
The third, and I think this is really important, objective laboratory or imaging finding should

269
0:27:35,920 --> 0:27:42,880
not be used as the only measure or assessment of a patient's well-being. Lack of laboratory or

270
0:27:42,880 --> 0:27:49,120
imaging abnormalities does not invalidate the existence, severity or important of a patient's

271
0:27:49,120 --> 0:27:54,800
symptoms or conditions. I have to admit that particularly one hits close to home. I lately had

272
0:27:54,800 --> 0:28:01,520
a woman who was severely cognitively impaired and the disability decision was basically,

273
0:28:02,080 --> 0:28:07,040
there's no objective lab or imaging abnormalities, so we're going to drop her claim and not continue

274
0:28:07,040 --> 0:28:12,800
to cover her. So I think it's really important that this is recognized. Health care professionals

275
0:28:12,800 --> 0:28:18,000
and patients are encouraged to set achievable goals through shared decision-making and to

276
0:28:18,000 --> 0:28:23,760
approach treatment by focusing on specific symptoms. So for example, if they have a headache or

277
0:28:23,760 --> 0:28:30,080
conditions such as dysautonomia, a comprehensive management plan focusing on improving physical,

278
0:28:30,080 --> 0:28:35,120
mental and social well-being may be helpful for some patients, but then just the honesty at the

279
0:28:35,120 --> 0:28:40,560
end. Understanding of post-COVID conditions remains incomplete and guidance for health care

280
0:28:40,560 --> 0:28:46,720
professionals will likely change over time as the evidence evolves and I'm going to say as we

281
0:28:46,720 --> 0:28:50,880
understand better what is going on and how to help these individuals. We do actually have quite a

282
0:28:50,880 --> 0:28:55,760
bit of a challenge. I'm actually in a meeting almost every day trying to look at how to address

283
0:28:55,760 --> 0:29:00,800
this issue, but we do have challenges because in part it's hard to identify these individuals. We

284
0:29:00,800 --> 0:29:05,760
don't necessarily have a diagnosis code, so we can't look through claims and say, oh, how many people

285
0:29:05,760 --> 0:29:12,400
are, you know, suffering from long COVID, but I wasn't a meeting earlier this week hearing that

286
0:29:12,400 --> 0:29:19,520
there may be a new code. This U09.9 might become active in October and that might allow a physician

287
0:29:19,520 --> 0:29:28,000
to identify this is a person who not just has a new diagnosis after COVID, but may have this post

288
0:29:28,000 --> 0:29:34,000
acute sequelae of COVID syndrome that we're all growing familiar with, the brain fog, the fatigue,

289
0:29:34,000 --> 0:29:39,200
the other disabilities. I will finish there, but then again, thank everyone for your continued

290
0:29:39,200 --> 0:29:43,680
support. I've noticed lately a lot of people are going to Patreon. It's just sort of setting up for

291
0:29:43,680 --> 0:29:49,680
a monthly contribution, which thank you so much. We're continuing through May, June, and July.

292
0:29:50,320 --> 0:29:56,960
Donations made to parasites without borders will be doubled up to a total contribution of $40,000

293
0:29:56,960 --> 0:30:02,480
to Foundation International Medical Relief of Children. This is really a tremendous organization

294
0:30:02,480 --> 0:30:07,040
that's out there helping people in the world struggling. We really want to support them because

295
0:30:07,040 --> 0:30:14,160
we are not safe until everyone is safe. Time for some email questions for Daniel. If you have one,

296
0:30:14,160 --> 0:30:22,000
you can send it to Daniel at microb.tv. Mark writes, wondering if you have seen any cases of PAM as a

297
0:30:22,000 --> 0:30:28,480
vascular stage sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection in your practice. PAM. So who knows what PAM is,

298
0:30:28,480 --> 0:30:35,280
paracetral acute middle maculopathy. So this is actually an issue where you have ischemia

299
0:30:35,280 --> 0:30:42,080
to part of the eye. So you have retinal capillary ischemia. And a lot of those patients, this is

300
0:30:42,080 --> 0:30:47,280
well-described, unfortunately, post-COVID. We know that COVID is not just a pulmonary disease. It's a

301
0:30:47,280 --> 0:30:53,040
vascular disease. There's clotting abnormalities. And so these patients are actually being managed

302
0:30:53,040 --> 0:30:59,520
by our ophthalmologist at this point. But yeah, this is a quite a challenge and I think just more

303
0:30:59,520 --> 0:31:07,920
evidence of that COVID is a disease that affects the entire body. So yeah, we actually recently,

304
0:31:07,920 --> 0:31:13,200
it was actually Tuesday night, we went through, we have a COVID recovery clinic here. We set up

305
0:31:13,200 --> 0:31:18,560
here at ProHealth. A lot of institutions have set them up. And a lot of what we do at that intake

306
0:31:18,560 --> 0:31:23,600
is connect patients with specialists that are committed to helping them. So when a person is

307
0:31:23,600 --> 0:31:27,040
seen with this presentation, we connect them with one of our ophthalmologists.

308
0:31:27,040 --> 0:31:34,400
Hi, I'm writes with most indoor spaces, rapidly moving to masks optional. What do I need to do

309
0:31:34,400 --> 0:31:39,680
to best keep my seven-year-old safe? Is his mask enough to protect him, at least for short

310
0:31:39,680 --> 0:31:44,720
exposures? What about longer, like synagogue services, should we just be keeping him away

311
0:31:44,720 --> 0:31:49,920
from all public indoor places other than school for the rest of the year until he can get vaccinated?

312
0:31:49,920 --> 0:31:54,960
So this is an excellent question. I know a lot of people have, you hit on several points in your

313
0:31:54,960 --> 0:32:00,240
question. And one of them, I think a big issue, is a lot of people have not been going to church

314
0:32:00,240 --> 0:32:05,040
synagogue mosque over the last year, or I guess wickin' outdoor circles and I'm gonna leave out

315
0:32:05,040 --> 0:32:13,040
the pagans right there. But you know, there is a risk that has to do with how much virus is in

316
0:32:13,040 --> 0:32:17,920
your community. And so what we're seeing in a lot of communities is an incredibly low

317
0:32:17,920 --> 0:32:25,920
prevalence incidence. And so let's take my immediate area where our test positivity rate is less

318
0:32:25,920 --> 0:32:31,440
than half a percent. These are places where you can start looking around high vaccination rates,

319
0:32:31,440 --> 0:32:35,680
low incidence of virus. You can start doing a risk calculation. There are other parts of the

320
0:32:35,680 --> 0:32:40,560
country where I'm gonna give really the opposite advice, low vaccination, still seeing lots of

321
0:32:40,560 --> 0:32:47,040
infection. So you're gonna have to balance that risk here. The mask really protects us when other

322
0:32:47,040 --> 0:32:51,920
people wear them. There is some protection you get from wearing it yourself. I sort of think of it

323
0:32:51,920 --> 0:32:56,880
as the 80-20 rule. You're getting about 20% of that. By you wearing it, you get about 80% if

324
0:32:56,880 --> 0:33:02,080
everyone else is wearing them. The other is really, as I brought up, vaccination if you're in a place

325
0:33:02,080 --> 0:33:07,680
where people are vaccinated. And again, it's gonna be a sort of threshold risk tolerance.

326
0:33:08,640 --> 0:33:12,800
I actually went to the gym yesterday and I took off my mask for the first time. It felt really

327
0:33:12,800 --> 0:33:18,240
uncomfortable. If I had young children, I think this is really important. Parents need to know

328
0:33:18,240 --> 0:33:22,640
sort of the risks, need to make decisions they're comfortable with. There's a few months left. We

329
0:33:22,640 --> 0:33:28,880
think we're gonna be in September having the ability to vaccinate younger individuals. Parents

330
0:33:28,880 --> 0:33:34,640
should have that as an option. Should they choose it? Come September. So you got to sort of weigh that.

331
0:33:35,200 --> 0:33:39,760
Alina writes, a question regarding a B cell depleted patient with multiple sclerosis in her

332
0:33:39,760 --> 0:33:46,480
40s, last infusion of retuximab, February 2021. First dose of Pfizer April, second dose three weeks

333
0:33:46,480 --> 0:33:52,720
later. In May, some B cells detectable less than 0.5%. Because of a former medication,

334
0:33:52,720 --> 0:33:58,960
there's a T cell deficiency. T cell responses are going to be tested anyway, as well as lymphopenia.

335
0:33:58,960 --> 0:34:03,280
She was tested for antibodies three weeks after the second vaccine dose. They were none at all

336
0:34:03,280 --> 0:34:08,800
detectable. Another round of shots is going to be administered July, hopefully in time before the

337
0:34:08,800 --> 0:34:13,760
next round of retuximab will be needed. Surgery because of a precancerous disease is at the moment

338
0:34:13,760 --> 0:34:18,800
being postponed until after vaccination, but has to happen in full this year at the latest.

339
0:34:18,800 --> 0:34:23,680
Question, what's to be done if the second round of vaccines does not build an immune response?

340
0:34:23,680 --> 0:34:28,720
Could monoclonals be a temporary solution for her for prevention of COVID in high risk settings

341
0:34:28,720 --> 0:34:33,920
like during hospitalization, where masking is not possible? Here in Germany, monoclonals are

342
0:34:33,920 --> 0:34:38,400
not licensed to prevent the use. So there happens to be the practical problem of how to get hold of

343
0:34:38,400 --> 0:34:43,600
them, even as the patient is willing to pay for all medication import transportation. Any ideas

344
0:34:43,600 --> 0:34:50,400
are highly appreciated. This is a great question. We brought up several tests before. There are

345
0:34:50,400 --> 0:34:54,560
millions of patients here in the United States. There are millions and millions of individuals

346
0:34:54,560 --> 0:34:59,120
throughout the world in very similar situations where they've received the vaccine. They don't

347
0:34:59,120 --> 0:35:03,920
have detectable antibodies. It's hard to do the T cell test outside of a research setting,

348
0:35:03,920 --> 0:35:09,760
to be honest. The adaptive T detect is the algorithm for analysis is set up to detect natural

349
0:35:09,760 --> 0:35:14,880
infection, not great for telling us, are you immune? Do you have a T cell shield, so to speak?

350
0:35:16,240 --> 0:35:21,120
The double vaccination people are definitely doing, sort of hear that kind of in there.

351
0:35:21,760 --> 0:35:26,720
A lot of people are giving even at least a third dose. This is all sort of outside. It's

352
0:35:26,720 --> 0:35:32,640
being actively studied at the moment. COVID is different, I got to say. If a person,

353
0:35:32,640 --> 0:35:38,560
I was just going over needle stick injuries yesterday with our frontline physicians. We

354
0:35:38,560 --> 0:35:43,920
tend to say, oh boy, if you were vaccinated and if you have negative serology, then people actually

355
0:35:43,920 --> 0:35:49,360
get immunoglobulin to protect them after acute. There are some studies. Actually,

356
0:35:49,360 --> 0:35:56,560
Regeneron published a preventive study. It makes sense. A lot of the monoclonal antibody

357
0:35:56,560 --> 0:36:02,640
manufacturers are looking at that. Different monoclonal antibodies have different half-lives,

358
0:36:02,640 --> 0:36:08,160
so it makes sense. There is some data to support that. A lot of it here in the US,

359
0:36:08,160 --> 0:36:13,040
I'll be able to share when that is part of the EUA for another indication.

360
0:36:13,040 --> 0:36:18,240
Once something is licensed, as our listeners may know, a physician could choose to use it off-label.

361
0:36:19,040 --> 0:36:23,600
Germany's going to be a particular different challenge, but that is sort of what we think is

362
0:36:23,600 --> 0:36:28,240
on the horizon for individuals that can't make their own antibodies. Potentially, we can give them

363
0:36:28,240 --> 0:36:34,640
those antibodies. And finally, from Jonathan, I'm an internal medicine hospitalist who's getting

364
0:36:34,640 --> 0:36:39,840
revenge against COVID by administering vaccines. I've been heartened to see our clinics here in

365
0:36:39,840 --> 0:36:44,960
San Diego fill up with young adolescents for Pfizer vaccine. However, I'm getting questions

366
0:36:44,960 --> 0:36:49,440
from parents about myocarditis in this population after the vaccine appears that the risk may be

367
0:36:49,440 --> 0:36:55,280
increased. It appears most cases are mild. However, it often helps to discuss these kinds of things

368
0:36:55,280 --> 0:37:00,720
in context. What is the underlying rate of myocarditis in this population? What is the relative risk

369
0:37:00,720 --> 0:37:06,560
of COVID infection versus myocarditis? What are long-term effects or serious outcome percentages

370
0:37:06,560 --> 0:37:12,000
in kids who get this inflammatory state? I can see a parent supportive of vaccination say, hmm,

371
0:37:12,000 --> 0:37:17,760
prevalence of virus where we live now is very low. So why risk having my kid get this vaccine-related

372
0:37:17,760 --> 0:37:22,160
condition? Yeah, no, so this is an excellent question. Hopefully, we've hit on some of the

373
0:37:22,160 --> 0:37:29,040
topics today. And I always frame this for parents that it's really a decision about vaccination

374
0:37:29,040 --> 0:37:34,000
versus getting COVID, right? Things are a little quiet here. We expect to be a little quiet over

375
0:37:34,000 --> 0:37:40,160
the summer. We are expecting to see increases in the fall of the winter. So as my wife says,

376
0:37:40,160 --> 0:37:44,080
boy, with what we're doing, if you don't get vaccinated, it's just a question of when you or

377
0:37:44,080 --> 0:37:49,040
your child get COVID. So that's how I try to weigh it. I say, well, if your child gets COVID,

378
0:37:49,040 --> 0:37:55,040
I think we put the numbers out there. There's about a one in 46 chance that they're going to end up

379
0:37:55,040 --> 0:38:01,040
with myocarditis from the infection itself based upon the athlete study. A lot of those cases will

380
0:38:01,040 --> 0:38:05,440
be a symptom. Actually, you won't even know that. We know that some of those cases have been

381
0:38:05,440 --> 0:38:10,800
severe enough that these athletes have been unable to perform, unable to participate in sports.

382
0:38:10,800 --> 0:38:16,640
So we know about the long, well, already the longer-term effects of natural infection.

383
0:38:16,640 --> 0:38:22,480
But what about vaccination? We've done millions of vaccinations in our country. There are a few

384
0:38:22,480 --> 0:38:29,200
hundred cases of myocarditis under investigation. The vast majority of those have really lasted

385
0:38:29,200 --> 0:38:33,520
for a day or two. They've gotten better with over-the-counter medications. They've resolved

386
0:38:33,520 --> 0:38:38,080
the children have done well. I understand the argument, oh, my gosh, but who knows long-term?

387
0:38:38,080 --> 0:38:42,160
Well, I think we know enough long-term. If you only had a very mild case that

388
0:38:42,160 --> 0:38:47,280
resolved in 48 hours or less, there's really minimal expectation that that's going to do

389
0:38:47,280 --> 0:38:52,880
serious harm to the heart. But boy, if you let your child go ahead and get infected with COVID,

390
0:38:52,880 --> 0:38:57,200
myocarditis is just one of the risks that you would be concerned about.

391
0:38:57,200 --> 0:39:03,600
That's COVID-19 clinical update number 67 with Dr. Daniel Griffin. Thank you, Daniel.

392
0:39:03,600 --> 0:39:08,960
Oh, thank you so much. And everyone, be safe.
