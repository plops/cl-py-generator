This week in virology, the podcast about viruses, the kind that make you sick.

2
0:00:10,400 --> 0:00:19,920
From Microbe TV, this is Twiv, this week in virology, episode 721, recorded on February 18,

3
0:00:19,920 --> 0:00:26,640
2021. I'm Vincent Racken Yellow, and you're listening to the podcast All About Viruses,

4
0:00:26,640 --> 0:00:34,880
joining me today from New York, Daniel Griffin. Hello, everyone. This is our update number 50,

5
0:00:34,880 --> 0:00:40,800
Daniel, almost a year's worth of updates. How about that? Yeah, that's quite something. Yeah,

6
0:00:40,800 --> 0:00:47,520
I guess 50 is a important number, but let's march through, let's not make this 50 minutes long.

7
0:00:47,520 --> 0:00:56,960
So, off with my quotation, in nature, nothing exists alone, and that's by Rachel Carson from

8
0:00:56,960 --> 0:01:03,920
Silent Spring. I just keep using it, bring people back to the fact that we talk a lot about things

9
0:01:03,920 --> 0:01:11,680
in the US, but we are part of the global community. And if we don't address this virus at a global

10
0:01:11,680 --> 0:01:17,760
level, it is not going to go well for anyone. We are part of the world. No walls that are going

11
0:01:17,760 --> 0:01:25,360
to keep this virus out. My three rules never miss an opportunity to vaccinate, never miss an

12
0:01:25,360 --> 0:01:30,880
opportunity to test, and never waste a vaccine dose. Still pains me when I hear that doses are

13
0:01:30,880 --> 0:01:35,280
being thrown in the trash because people are worried they'll be legal consequences.

14
0:01:35,280 --> 0:01:41,520
So, let's go through our stages. So, the pre-exposure period, there's a lot of coverage on the CDC

15
0:01:41,520 --> 0:01:46,720
guidance on school openings. You know, the CDC, you can go there. There's a lot to read there.

16
0:01:47,280 --> 0:01:54,080
Couple criticisms people have is there may be not enough focus on ventilation. But for the first

17
0:01:54,080 --> 0:01:59,200
time, what I am really seeing is a lot of the school opening plans are introducing testing,

18
0:01:59,200 --> 0:02:03,920
and it looks like there's federal support for testing, testing saves lives.

19
0:02:03,920 --> 0:02:10,240
And I know early on a bit of controversy about testing and a period of time when some politicians

20
0:02:10,240 --> 0:02:14,960
were trying to get people not to test. And I am not talking just about at the federal level,

21
0:02:14,960 --> 0:02:19,360
but we've moved past that. And I think we all now realize, and this has embraced,

22
0:02:19,360 --> 0:02:25,440
testing saves lives. Don't let the testing numbers go down. We need two million tests a day

23
0:02:26,080 --> 0:02:31,280
to keep making the progress we're making, to keep an eye on what's going on. So, you got to keep

24
0:02:31,280 --> 0:02:37,280
testing. Active vaccination, a little bit more out of Israel on the impact of vaccination on

25
0:02:37,280 --> 0:02:42,400
viral load. And I think this is a little bit better than the data that I discussed last week.

26
0:02:42,400 --> 0:02:47,920
I was not impressed with a single CT value change. But this was posted as a pre-print,

27
0:02:47,920 --> 0:02:54,080
decreased SARS-CoV-2 viral load following vaccination. So, it reminds me when I say that.

28
0:02:54,080 --> 0:02:57,280
And Vincent, maybe you remember, we had a big discussion. Are we going to ever discuss

29
0:02:57,280 --> 0:03:02,400
preprints? Are we going to wait until things hit the peer review? And I guess we embraced,

30
0:03:02,400 --> 0:03:09,600
we will be pre-print reviewers and discuss the data critically. But in this study, they looked

31
0:03:09,600 --> 0:03:16,720
at CT values of positive samples collected 12 to 28 days after vaccination. And they compared

32
0:03:16,720 --> 0:03:22,320
these to CT values of positive samples taking during the first 11 days following vaccination.

33
0:03:22,320 --> 0:03:29,760
So, I felt this was apples to apples. And they reported the differences in mean CT values calculated

34
0:03:29,760 --> 0:03:36,400
for these two time periods. Basically, looked at three different, so they looked at RDRP,

35
0:03:36,400 --> 0:03:43,840
right? That's the RNA dependent RNA preliminase gene. They looked at the gene E, they looked at

36
0:03:43,840 --> 0:03:49,360
gene. But just to give you a sense, they were seeing here about a two CT value difference.

37
0:03:49,360 --> 0:03:55,840
So, decreased from about, or I guess the CT value is increasing, the viral load is decreasing.

38
0:03:55,840 --> 0:04:01,520
So, I got to keep that in mind here. So, the CT value was increasing by about two from 25

39
0:04:01,520 --> 0:04:07,760
up to about 27. So, we're looking at an RNA copy number going from about 1.5 million

40
0:04:07,760 --> 0:04:13,760
down to about 400,000. So, that's going in the right direction. We're trying to build a case,

41
0:04:13,760 --> 0:04:19,280
and I'm sure this will come up at the end about if you've been vaccinated, are you less like

42
0:04:19,280 --> 0:04:24,800
to carry a high level of virus and transmit it to others? And I think the data is starting to

43
0:04:24,800 --> 0:04:30,560
support that story. The period of detectable viral replication, I get a lot of people saying,

44
0:04:30,560 --> 0:04:35,360
well, Dan, where are the antivirals? And I want to say this is an excellent question.

45
0:04:35,920 --> 0:04:40,960
We really just have, as far as what we think of small molecules remdesivir, weak evidence,

46
0:04:40,960 --> 0:04:47,360
minimal impact, maybe shortens our hospital stay by a few days, no compelling mortality data there.

47
0:04:47,360 --> 0:04:53,520
But monoclonals, growing amounts of data and evidence there suggesting that there's even a

48
0:04:53,520 --> 0:04:59,280
mortality benefit as well. There is convalescent plasma, but remember the compelling data there

49
0:04:59,280 --> 0:05:05,120
was on high titer used within the first 72 hours. Had a discussion today at our hospitals. A lot

50
0:05:05,120 --> 0:05:10,080
of the centers around the country don't titer their convalescent plasma. By the time someone

51
0:05:10,080 --> 0:05:14,640
shows up in the hospital, they're usually past those first 72 hours. And when you compare apples

52
0:05:14,640 --> 0:05:18,800
to apples here, if you have a choice to drink convalescent plasma and monoclonals, the data

53
0:05:18,800 --> 0:05:25,680
is more compelling on monoclonals. So right now, our best antiviral therapeutic is monoclonals.

54
0:05:26,240 --> 0:05:30,720
But don't miss your window. This is a numbers game. Don't say, oh, you look like you're doing

55
0:05:30,720 --> 0:05:36,560
well. Let's wait. If you wait, you can miss your window. And one of the nice little bits of news

56
0:05:36,560 --> 0:05:41,440
here is we just got approval that we're going to be able to start offering monoclonal therapy

57
0:05:41,440 --> 0:05:47,120
at our urgent care centers throughout the New York tri-state area. So improving access,

58
0:05:47,760 --> 0:05:51,280
we're going to have the ability through the Catholics to get it in the ERs, through the

59
0:05:51,280 --> 0:05:57,120
Northwell system to get it in the tents, through the Pro Health, Riverside, and Pro Health Connecticut

60
0:05:57,120 --> 0:06:01,920
to get urgent care centers. And through United and Research, we're going to keep doing in-home

61
0:06:01,920 --> 0:06:08,560
infusions and down to 16 minutes per the FDA. I know folks are still taking an hour to get it

62
0:06:08,560 --> 0:06:13,840
in there, but we have approval now for 16 minutes. Early inflammatory phase, there was another

63
0:06:13,840 --> 0:06:18,080
interesting paper put up on the Lancet as a preprint. I actually think this is interesting. This

64
0:06:18,080 --> 0:06:25,200
is a paper that I've already seen is changing people's practice. And this was a vitamin D paper,

65
0:06:25,200 --> 0:06:32,080
yes, calcifidile treatment and COVID-19 related outcomes by a group in Barcelona. And this followed

66
0:06:32,080 --> 0:06:39,040
on that pilot study that I discussed on October 4th on that TWIV. So they had done a pilot study.

67
0:06:39,040 --> 0:06:44,960
Now this was the prospective open label randomized control trial. They had under 1,000, just under

68
0:06:44,960 --> 0:06:51,840
1,930 participants. And they were randomized to either receive oral calcifidile treatment.

69
0:06:52,560 --> 0:07:01,520
That was 532 micrograms on day one, 266 on day three, 71530. And they started this right at the

70
0:07:01,520 --> 0:07:06,880
time of hospital admission. And then the controls were not receiving this. So I sort of jokingly

71
0:07:06,880 --> 0:07:11,600
said, you know, I think in the past that nobody's going to do a study with a vitamin D deficient

72
0:07:11,600 --> 0:07:16,640
control arm, but apparently they do that in Spain. And in the intention to treat analysis,

73
0:07:17,520 --> 0:07:25,360
6.5% of the folks treated with vitamin D died compared to 15% in the control arm, giving us a

74
0:07:25,360 --> 0:07:33,360
p value of 0.001. So the adjusted results actually showed a reduced mortality about 60%.

75
0:07:34,240 --> 0:07:41,120
So relative risk 0.40. So what we're starting to see, at least in hospitalized patients,

76
0:07:41,120 --> 0:07:45,440
if people were not listening to me and fouching a few others, and they're not taking their vitamin

77
0:07:45,440 --> 0:07:51,600
D and showing up deficient, a lot of folks are actually starting vitamin D when they get admitted.

78
0:07:51,600 --> 0:07:58,240
But just a few basics here, just to remind people, this study looked at calcifidile

79
0:07:58,880 --> 0:08:04,800
treatment. But a lot of us in the US are using ergo calciferal and coli calciferal, right? So the

80
0:08:04,800 --> 0:08:10,320
coli calciferal is that vitamin D3 that we're taking 1,000, 2,000 different recommended

81
0:08:10,320 --> 0:08:18,000
doses per day. The ergo calciferal is our vitamin D2 that is often weekly. So our D3,

82
0:08:18,000 --> 0:08:24,560
usually animal origin, so oily fish, egg yolks, meat, your ergo calciferal is going to be from

83
0:08:24,560 --> 0:08:31,120
certain vegetables. And so things get a little bit complicated for us here because we don't

84
0:08:31,120 --> 0:08:35,680
quite have the same formulation used in the study. So a lot of us here in the US are just

85
0:08:35,680 --> 0:08:41,760
using the vitamin D3, the coli calciferal, 4,000 I use per day. But I do want to point out check

86
0:08:41,760 --> 0:08:47,280
those vitamin D levels. I had a patient today, maybe he listens to much Twiv. His vitamin D level

87
0:08:47,280 --> 0:08:55,280
was 138 at admission. Normal would be less than 80, sort of a 30 to 80 range. 138, that's too high.

88
0:08:55,280 --> 0:09:00,240
So he and I actually had to have a talk about not taking so much vitamin D. I'll say in some of

89
0:09:00,240 --> 0:09:05,280
the hospitals, it's been fairly standard to give people vitamin D, sort of a thought maybe a benefit,

90
0:09:05,280 --> 0:09:09,920
no significant concern for harm. Some of the hospitals though, this is new. All right,

91
0:09:09,920 --> 0:09:18,400
we had another study actually on zinc and vitamin C. This was not as positive. This was

92
0:09:18,400 --> 0:09:25,280
effective high dose zinc and ascorbic acids, that's vitamin C supplementation versus usual care.

93
0:09:25,280 --> 0:09:30,880
And they were looking on symptom length and reduction among ambulatory patients with SARS-CoV-2

94
0:09:30,880 --> 0:09:36,960
infection. This was the COVID-A to Z randomized clinical trial, and it was published in JAMA.

95
0:09:36,960 --> 0:09:42,880
This was only 214 patients. So by the time you break them down, you're looking only about 50

96
0:09:42,880 --> 0:09:50,320
folks in each group. And they looked at basically the amount of days before they reported a 50%

97
0:09:50,320 --> 0:09:56,880
reduction in symptoms. So usual care, they're saying about 4.4. The folks who got just zinc

98
0:09:56,880 --> 0:10:04,320
said 4.9, vitamin C, 3.7, the group that got vitamin C and zinc, 3.4, a lot of overlap here.

99
0:10:04,320 --> 0:10:09,920
So no real compelling difference. I mentioned this as a small study. And there was the issue

100
0:10:09,920 --> 0:10:16,400
that the folks who got zinc were reporting metallic taste, dry mouth, gastrointestinal

101
0:10:16,400 --> 0:10:21,920
intolerance. So the people in the vitamin C group actually, there was differences in the

102
0:10:21,920 --> 0:10:27,440
amount of nausea, diarrhea, stomach cramps. So small groups doesn't sort of compel us in any way,

103
0:10:27,440 --> 0:10:33,440
more information there. Another paper on anticoagulation. But here was really the focus. And I think

104
0:10:33,440 --> 0:10:39,920
this is an important paper. It was demonstrating a mortality benefit to doing anticoagulation versus

105
0:10:39,920 --> 0:10:45,520
not. Maybe this reminds people of the COVID wars that we discussed about, where we were seeing

106
0:10:45,520 --> 0:10:51,680
about 30% of the folks not in anticoagulation having major events. So there was a tendency to

107
0:10:51,680 --> 0:10:56,080
want to use at least prophylactic and a thought of maybe studying prophylactic versus high dose.

108
0:10:56,080 --> 0:11:04,160
This was actually looking at prophylactic versus none. And there was a 27% decreased risk for 30

109
0:11:04,160 --> 0:11:11,600
day mortality. So really concluding here that early initiation of anticoagulation compared with

110
0:11:11,600 --> 0:11:17,760
no anticoagulation was associated with decreased 30 day mortality. They did not see a significant

111
0:11:17,760 --> 0:11:22,240
increase in the risk of serious bleeding events in this trial. But just to sort of put this in

112
0:11:22,240 --> 0:11:28,560
the context of our other trials, there's now data to suggest that the optimum dosing for our

113
0:11:28,560 --> 0:11:35,600
moderate floor patients is going to be full dose, lower risk of bleeding there. In our ICU

114
0:11:35,600 --> 0:11:39,600
level patients, we're going to back off a little to prophylactic dosing just because we have an

115
0:11:39,600 --> 0:11:44,960
increased risk of bleeding. This does still leave out a little bit. What do we do with those out

116
0:11:44,960 --> 0:11:48,960
patients, right? We still don't have as much data as we would like. So that's going to be a lot

117
0:11:48,960 --> 0:11:53,280
of a judgment call looking at each individual patient. I just want to do a deeper dive into

118
0:11:53,280 --> 0:11:59,360
the tosyllismab data that I mentioned hot off the press last time. And I want to say this is

119
0:11:59,360 --> 0:12:06,080
already resulted in the revisions of a lot of hospital guidelines. Tosyllismab has now been

120
0:12:06,080 --> 0:12:13,280
reintroduced. And this was based upon the recovery data. I'm going to discuss this a bit last time.

121
0:12:13,280 --> 0:12:19,680
Tosyllismab in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 recovery trial. Preliminary results of a

122
0:12:19,680 --> 0:12:25,600
randomized controlled open label platform trial. So as I mentioned, last time, this study looked

123
0:12:25,600 --> 0:12:32,720
at over 4,000 patients. And the tosyllismab was given in a weight-based dosing regimen.

124
0:12:33,360 --> 0:12:38,240
So if you're greater than 90 kilograms, you're going to get 800 milligrams. If you're between

125
0:12:38,240 --> 0:12:45,440
65 and 90, it'll be 600 milligrams. 400 milligrams. If your weight is greater than 40 K but less than

126
0:12:45,440 --> 0:12:50,880
65. And then you drop down to an 8 milligram per kilogram if the weight's less than 40.

127
0:12:51,440 --> 0:12:56,800
And then a second dose in this study was given 12 to 24 hours later. If in the opinion of the

128
0:12:56,800 --> 0:13:03,360
attending clinician, the patient's condition had not improved. And here we basically saw that there

129
0:13:03,360 --> 0:13:13,440
was a 14% reduction in 28 day mortality p value less than 0.007. And about a 20% reduction

130
0:13:13,440 --> 0:13:18,960
in the risk of being intimated there with a p value of 0.01. So this this builds on the REM

131
0:13:18,960 --> 0:13:24,720
cap data. But I want to sort of be clear on where this fits in. This isn't everybody gets

132
0:13:24,720 --> 0:13:30,960
tosyllismab. So this is a background of steroids is critical. We have a lot of studies showing

133
0:13:30,960 --> 0:13:36,880
that if you give the IL-6 receptor inhibitors without a background of steroids, even in the

134
0:13:36,880 --> 0:13:42,000
recovery trial, there was a trend towards higher mortality. So you don't want to do that. It also

135
0:13:42,000 --> 0:13:46,880
looks like the benefit we're seeing here is in the early inflammatory phase, right? We have a lot

136
0:13:46,880 --> 0:13:53,280
of trials showing that if you give an IL-6 receptor blocker, so a tosyllismab to someone week three

137
0:13:53,280 --> 0:13:58,480
in that secondary infection, that late phase, that that actually may increase infections,

138
0:13:58,480 --> 0:14:04,000
not provide benefit. So what we're doing here at a lot of our hospitals, I'll say that Catholic

139
0:14:04,000 --> 0:14:08,320
health systems actually have been our standard approach for some time. But some of the other

140
0:14:08,320 --> 0:14:14,160
hospitals, they've they've updated. Basically, if a person comes in, they're on oxygen,

141
0:14:14,160 --> 0:14:18,400
they've been started on steroids, but now they progressed to a high level of oxygen support,

142
0:14:18,400 --> 0:14:25,200
then tosyllismab is considered secondary infection phase. Again, I was like to point out the timing

143
0:14:25,200 --> 0:14:30,400
of that is most people with COVID come in without a secondary bacterial infection. But then a lot

144
0:14:30,400 --> 0:14:35,360
of folks, we see either they stay in the hospital and then week three, they have this, or they go

145
0:14:35,360 --> 0:14:39,600
out and they come back and then are differential. One of the things that can drive that readmission

146
0:14:39,600 --> 0:14:47,440
can be a secondary infection. So finding the ferritin procalcitonin ratio that my buddy Lee Shapiro

147
0:14:47,440 --> 0:14:53,680
has championed to be quite helpful, fairly predictive. If you take the ferritin divided by procalcitonin,

148
0:14:53,680 --> 0:14:59,120
numbers less than 844 suggestive of bacterial numbers higher than that, particularly up in the

149
0:14:59,120 --> 0:15:05,760
thousands suggesting your procalcitonin elevation is being driven by the inflammation are multi-system

150
0:15:05,760 --> 0:15:10,320
inflammatory phase. Actually, you spend a little time on this because we have a little bit more

151
0:15:10,320 --> 0:15:15,680
data now. So I want to point out again, there is an early inflammatory phase,

152
0:15:15,680 --> 0:15:21,680
and then there's this later multi-system inflammatory phase. So there's a bimodal inflammatory nature,

153
0:15:21,680 --> 0:15:27,840
and either for some folks, this is a readmission. As we saw with children, this may be the first

154
0:15:27,840 --> 0:15:34,960
time it comes to attention. So an update on the multi-inflammatory syndrome of children. The number

155
0:15:34,960 --> 0:15:41,360
of cases now reported the CDC is keeping track of this is over 2000, and we've had about 30

156
0:15:41,360 --> 0:15:47,520
confirmed deaths. So the number of, and this is a little bit of different, the number, or I'll

157
0:15:47,520 --> 0:15:53,840
say the percentage of the pediatric cases that are now coming in requiring ICU support,

158
0:15:53,840 --> 0:15:59,440
it used to be about 50%. It's now greater than 80%. So I'm not sure I understand exactly what

159
0:15:59,440 --> 0:16:05,520
the difference is with the severity there. We also understand a little bit of these 2000 cases.

160
0:16:05,520 --> 0:16:10,800
The peak of this tends to be in the five to nine year old rage, and there now is a nice case

161
0:16:10,800 --> 0:16:16,320
definition for the multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children. And the first distinction

162
0:16:16,320 --> 0:16:22,480
is this is someone under the age of 21. If they're over the age 21, it might be in adults, and we

163
0:16:22,480 --> 0:16:27,040
see that as well. They have to present with fever, laboratory evidence of inflammation,

164
0:16:27,680 --> 0:16:33,280
evidence of clinically severe illness requiring the hospitalization with multi-system. So greater

165
0:16:33,280 --> 0:16:38,800
than two organs being involved. This could be cardiac, renal, respiratory, hematologic,

166
0:16:38,800 --> 0:16:45,120
gastrointestinal, skin, or neurological, and no alternative explanation.

167
0:16:45,120 --> 0:16:51,680
And then, ideally, from the case definition, you have positive evidence for either current or

168
0:16:51,680 --> 0:16:57,120
recent SARS-2 COVID infection. So you could be doing your PCR, serology, antigen tests,

169
0:16:57,760 --> 0:17:02,720
or a good story of a COVID-19 exposure within the four weeks prior to the onset of symptoms.

170
0:17:02,720 --> 0:17:07,840
And the CDC now has a nice link where people can go. The tail phase, I want to spend a little bit

171
0:17:07,840 --> 0:17:14,400
time here, just before we got on the air, Vincent and I were chatting about an individual with

172
0:17:14,400 --> 0:17:21,120
Wong COVID who had what sounded like a very negative encounter. They went to the emergency room,

173
0:17:21,120 --> 0:17:26,160
tachycardia, swelling in the legs, continuing to suffer from COVID. And the basically we were

174
0:17:26,160 --> 0:17:33,120
told, hey, this is what your life is going to be like, get used to it. Not acceptable. There are

175
0:17:33,120 --> 0:17:39,120
a lot of us, I have to say, who are really keeping an eye on Wong COVID, taking care of a growing

176
0:17:39,120 --> 0:17:46,000
number of patients. And I have a lot of frustration here. As I mentioned here, we've had a lot of

177
0:17:46,000 --> 0:17:51,360
research on our vaccines. We've had a lot of research on the care of hospitalized patients

178
0:17:51,360 --> 0:17:56,960
with COVID. We still don't have robust data to guide us in the outpatient management.

179
0:17:56,960 --> 0:18:01,920
We don't have robust data to guide us in the care of Wong COVID. There's a lot of centers

180
0:18:01,920 --> 0:18:06,480
that really are set up by, say, rehabilitation specialists. Basically, let's condition these

181
0:18:06,480 --> 0:18:11,920
people back up. And, you know, as we know with our experience with other chronic illnesses,

182
0:18:11,920 --> 0:18:16,880
that's not always acceptable. A lot of people have post-exertional malaise. There's a lot of

183
0:18:16,880 --> 0:18:22,320
stuff going on here. We're still seeing increased infections in these individuals months and months

184
0:18:22,320 --> 0:18:27,520
after the acute period. Something's going on here. And a lot of us are really actively trying to

185
0:18:27,520 --> 0:18:33,280
understand this. So those would be out there listening with with Wong COVID. You're not

186
0:18:33,280 --> 0:18:37,680
forgotten. We're trying to understand and provide better therapies. And one of the things actually

187
0:18:37,680 --> 0:18:45,280
we're quite interested in is if you get a vaccine, are you less likely to get long COVID? So some

188
0:18:45,280 --> 0:18:49,280
people I know who are younger think about the vaccines. And they say, well, I'm not going to

189
0:18:49,280 --> 0:18:54,640
die of COVID at a very low risk of dying of COVID. But I am worried, you know, I might be in my 20s,

190
0:18:54,640 --> 0:19:00,800
30s, 40s. If I get COVID, I might end up never better. So we're tracking those individuals. We're

191
0:19:00,800 --> 0:19:05,760
also tracking ever study fired up on this, where we're looking at people that got the monoclonal

192
0:19:05,760 --> 0:19:10,720
antibodies. Not only is that going to keep people out of the hospital, but is it going to prevent

193
0:19:10,720 --> 0:19:17,280
people from developing long COVID? So a lot going on here. And then I will close before we go to

194
0:19:17,280 --> 0:19:23,280
emails by reminding people to go to parasites without borders and help us support the American

195
0:19:23,280 --> 0:19:28,560
Society for Tropical Medicine and Hygiene. For the months of February and March, we're going to

196
0:19:28,560 --> 0:19:35,360
donate a minimum of $20,000, hopefully up to $40,000, matching what people send us to help bring

197
0:19:35,360 --> 0:19:41,680
some early career investigators, scientists, physicians from less developed parts of the world.

198
0:19:41,680 --> 0:19:46,080
Women, we're going to be sexist here. We're only going to be helping women. But I think that's

199
0:19:46,080 --> 0:19:54,240
right. I mean, 15% of the leadership in medicine in global health is made up of women. And that's

200
0:19:54,240 --> 0:19:59,200
just there's an equity issue there. And we want to jump in. We want to make a difference. So help

201
0:19:59,200 --> 0:20:04,720
us do that. All right, time for some questions for Daniel. If you have some, send them to Daniel

202
0:20:04,720 --> 0:20:11,680
at microbe.tv. The first is from Chris. The CDC is now saying, if someone has been fully vaccinated

203
0:20:11,680 --> 0:20:18,240
two weeks after they do not have to quarantine when directly exposed to someone with COVID. Chris

204
0:20:18,240 --> 0:20:24,480
wants to visit his infant grandson, neither of his parents are vaccinated. It won't be anytime soon.

205
0:20:25,120 --> 0:20:29,680
If I have to quarantine before I visit, what is the minimum amount of time to ensure a good

206
0:20:29,680 --> 0:20:35,120
amount of safety? And Chris has been fully vaccinated. Yeah. So Chris, and I alluded to this a little.

207
0:20:35,120 --> 0:20:40,240
I mean, the the CDC talked about someone who's been exposed, and then saying, hey, we're going

208
0:20:40,240 --> 0:20:44,480
to treat people who've been fully vaccinated like someone who had a recent infection with COVID.

209
0:20:44,480 --> 0:20:49,280
And we're going to, we're going to believe, and they are stepping a little in front of the science,

210
0:20:49,280 --> 0:20:54,720
but the science is starting to get there, that these individuals are less likely to become infected,

211
0:20:54,720 --> 0:21:02,400
less likely to transmit. We know about a 95% reduction in symptomatic. We don't quite have a solid data

212
0:21:02,400 --> 0:21:09,280
on the impact of asymptomatic, but now we're starting to see lower viral loads. So I'm going to

213
0:21:09,280 --> 0:21:13,680
basically give you the information to make the decision here. I don't think quarantine is going

214
0:21:13,680 --> 0:21:20,560
to be something you need to do. You want to continue to engage in low risk activity. Just treat this

215
0:21:20,560 --> 0:21:26,080
as this possibility that you could be exposed, could have low level asymptomatic and not be aware

216
0:21:26,080 --> 0:21:31,840
of it, or you could have pre-symptomatic, right? It's a 95% reduction, not 100%. And don't forget

217
0:21:31,840 --> 0:21:37,360
about testing. Testing is still another thing. You know, we talk about the Swiss cheese approach,

218
0:21:37,360 --> 0:21:45,280
multiple layers, right? So you got your vaccine, you get your test, you look at different exposures

219
0:21:45,280 --> 0:21:51,680
and how to do things safely. But I think that we need to start basically being honest and not

220
0:21:51,680 --> 0:21:57,600
underselling the vaccines. And the biggest risk for older individuals was that they would get

221
0:21:57,600 --> 0:22:03,840
COVID and die. But there's been a tremendous burden, a tremendous social isolation. So that

222
0:22:03,840 --> 0:22:08,240
would be my advice on this. Vaccination is great, but don't forget about testing.

223
0:22:08,240 --> 0:22:13,040
All right, Javad writes, as a primary care physician who works both in the clinic and

224
0:22:13,040 --> 0:22:17,200
hospital and his faculty at both the med school and residency, I'm disappointed at the lack of

225
0:22:17,200 --> 0:22:23,360
guidance there is for COVID management and primary care. There is clear guidance for how to manage

226
0:22:23,360 --> 0:22:29,040
COVID patients in the hospital based upon a fair amount of research. There's almost nothing for

227
0:22:29,040 --> 0:22:35,680
primary care doctors. And Javad goes on to talk about monoclonal antibodies, which are underutilized

228
0:22:36,480 --> 0:22:43,120
in his system at the University of Minnesota, even though we have far more COVID in the community

229
0:22:43,120 --> 0:22:48,000
than in the hospital, basic questions of whether to use anti coagulation and or aspirin have not

230
0:22:48,000 --> 0:22:53,760
been answered. Therapeutics that are logistically more feasible are not known. A small study showed

231
0:22:53,760 --> 0:22:59,760
fluvoxamine could be a game changer in terms of limiting hospitalization, but a larger study is

232
0:22:59,760 --> 0:23:05,440
in its early stages. What would you recommend in terms of outpatient management? We are doing a

233
0:23:05,440 --> 0:23:10,240
lot of testing and monitoring, but it would be nice to have better research and guidance as to

234
0:23:10,240 --> 0:23:15,200
what more can be done. All right, so Javad, you bring up some excellent points. First off,

235
0:23:15,200 --> 0:23:20,960
say hello to my buddies there at University of Minnesota. It's a fantastic place, by the way,

236
0:23:20,960 --> 0:23:28,560
except it's cold. I spent a winter visit there in the end of June once, joking about that.

237
0:23:29,360 --> 0:23:34,560
But no, you are completely right. What the COVID pandemic has really pointed out to us

238
0:23:34,560 --> 0:23:41,760
is what a poor system we have for rapidly studying outpatient therapies, right? I mean,

239
0:23:41,760 --> 0:23:46,160
the monoclonals almost didn't make it to market because they were studying them in week three

240
0:23:46,160 --> 0:23:51,920
ICU patients, right? We really need to change that. We need a robust ability to study

241
0:23:52,640 --> 0:23:59,040
outpatient therapeutics and to point out, right, 80, 90% of folks with COVID are managed in the

242
0:23:59,040 --> 0:24:05,280
outpatient setting. So what do we do? There is limited data. So let me go through what there is.

243
0:24:05,280 --> 0:24:09,040
First thing, it's diagnosed one of the first things. You mentioned monoclonal antibodies.

244
0:24:09,040 --> 0:24:15,280
That's critical. If the person qualifies, and hopefully this is going to expand as far as access,

245
0:24:15,280 --> 0:24:21,680
monoclonal antibodies are a game changer. We do not recommend starting steroids in that first week,

246
0:24:22,320 --> 0:24:25,440
but I'll tell you, in the New York area, a lot of times when you get to week two,

247
0:24:25,440 --> 0:24:30,800
when people start to drop their SATs below 94, we're starting steroids in the outpatient setting,

248
0:24:30,800 --> 0:24:35,680
we're actually doing home oxygen and pulse oximeter. We have actually programs where

249
0:24:35,680 --> 0:24:39,760
we're managing a large number of patients that in other parts of the country probably are in

250
0:24:39,760 --> 0:24:46,960
the hospital. What about anticoagulation in that context? Is it aspirin? Are we using things like

251
0:24:46,960 --> 0:24:53,920
the Eliquis or Zerelto? Can you say brand names there? I apologize. So in some situations, yes,

252
0:24:53,920 --> 0:25:00,560
we do have some limited data on aspirin, providing a benefit as well. But no, you are totally right

253
0:25:00,560 --> 0:25:07,920
here. I saw the SSRI study, this the flu boxamine study. And that is very interesting. And where's

254
0:25:07,920 --> 0:25:12,720
the rest of the data there? Where's the data? I think we've sort of joked about of giving people

255
0:25:12,720 --> 0:25:18,320
vitamin D and seeing if that keeps people out of the hospital. These are inexpensive therapies

256
0:25:18,320 --> 0:25:23,920
that we would love to have the answers to. And we don't. It's a year later. So I see all this data

257
0:25:23,920 --> 0:25:28,880
coming out of the UK. What would we do without the UK? We wouldn't know the benefit of steroids.

258
0:25:28,880 --> 0:25:34,720
And we would know the benefit of when to use tosy. So yeah, we need to do a better job.

259
0:25:34,720 --> 0:25:41,200
William writes, is it safe to receive COVID vaccine if you are incubating COVID-19 or ill

260
0:25:41,200 --> 0:25:47,520
with COVID-19? So William, we don't recommend vaccinating people if they're ill with COVID-19.

261
0:25:48,480 --> 0:25:53,040
Basically, we're treating them with other therapeutics. We're waiting until they get better. And then

262
0:25:54,000 --> 0:25:58,320
the CDC is saying there's no minimum time to wait. Like once you get over COVID-19,

263
0:25:58,320 --> 0:26:02,160
don't miss your opportunity to immunize. If you wait three months, like I know some people

264
0:26:02,160 --> 0:26:05,920
recommend, I feel like you're missing that opportunity. Again, who knows what that person is feeling

265
0:26:05,920 --> 0:26:10,720
like in three months? Maybe they don't want to get vaccinated then. You've lost that. But we've

266
0:26:10,720 --> 0:26:15,920
certainly have seen a lot of folks who come in. They don't get tested. They get their COVID shot

267
0:26:15,920 --> 0:26:23,600
and they were incubating COVID. And I actually a woman I'm taking care of today. And as I expressed

268
0:26:23,600 --> 0:26:27,360
to her, most of the patients that I've seen, unfortunately, I've seen a lot of folks,

269
0:26:27,360 --> 0:26:31,360
where they got their COVID shot three or four days later, they're not feeling well. They're

270
0:26:31,360 --> 0:26:35,680
thinking, you know, this reactogenicity, it's just a little bit rough. And then they get a test and

271
0:26:35,680 --> 0:26:41,360
they realize, no, I actually was incubating COVID when I got vaccinated. These people, I have to say,

272
0:26:41,360 --> 0:26:46,720
tend to do quite well. I don't know if it's that we're giving them a nice boost of the spike protein

273
0:26:46,720 --> 0:26:51,760
response. But when I'm discussed with colleagues, they've shared similar experiences. So we don't

274
0:26:51,760 --> 0:26:58,000
intentionally vaccinate people who are incubating COVID. I've actually encouraged a lot of the centers,

275
0:26:58,000 --> 0:27:02,480
particularly with the high rates that we have of testing people when they come in for vaccines,

276
0:27:02,480 --> 0:27:09,360
if possible, too many situations where, you know, a group comes in and everyone gets vaccinated.

277
0:27:09,360 --> 0:27:13,840
And one of those people in the group has COVID. And then they find out a day or two later,

278
0:27:13,840 --> 0:27:18,320
and then we know everyone there got COVID, you know, riding to and from in the car, right?

279
0:27:19,040 --> 0:27:22,400
So I'm going to encourage people to continue to test.

280
0:27:22,400 --> 0:27:28,560
All right, one more, Daniel from Stefan, whose mother has had a long difficult problem with COVID

281
0:27:29,520 --> 0:27:35,600
starting out on Long Island, in fact, and has taken a long time to recover now is in Florida,

282
0:27:35,600 --> 0:27:41,920
where the doctors say she can be vaccinated, but he's not sure. She's suffering from PTSD,

283
0:27:41,920 --> 0:27:47,680
has difficulty breathing. And he wants to know, can she get the mRNA vaccine? Should she wait for

284
0:27:47,680 --> 0:27:54,960
J and J? She's he's heard about people in Europe, frail seniors in Europe passing away after receiving

285
0:27:54,960 --> 0:28:01,920
the mRNA vaccine. In Florida, he's worried that she's going to get infected if she's not vaccinated.

286
0:28:02,560 --> 0:28:07,280
So what do you think, Daniel? Yeah, no, these are excellent questions. And I think you lay it out.

287
0:28:07,920 --> 0:28:15,360
I've certainly seen some fairly frail, older individuals who, you know, I say the difference

288
0:28:15,360 --> 0:28:20,400
between, you know, you and me with reactogenicity, maybe whether or not we make it to work with

289
0:28:20,400 --> 0:28:25,360
some individuals, the reactogenicity, maybe whether or not they, you know, continue to survive,

290
0:28:25,360 --> 0:28:30,640
right? I mean, a lot of people have significant oxygen requirements. They have pretty severe

291
0:28:30,640 --> 0:28:34,560
disease. I've actually seen a few people get vaccinated actually end up in the hospital for a

292
0:28:34,560 --> 0:28:39,760
few days, because the reactogenicity put them below that level. So this is not one of those

293
0:28:39,760 --> 0:28:44,000
where I just sort of say, Oh, go ahead and have her do it. You want to have a conversation because

294
0:28:44,000 --> 0:28:49,200
this is a risk benefit here. If she gets a second bout of COVID, and we certainly know people get

295
0:28:49,200 --> 0:28:54,960
reinfected, it's a question of what percent, right? You know, how is she going to do when you

296
0:28:54,960 --> 0:29:00,240
describe her getting a second infection? So you want to balance that against the reactogenicity.

297
0:29:00,240 --> 0:29:06,080
The reactogenicity is a couple days of, you know, and in a person who had had prior COVID,

298
0:29:06,640 --> 0:29:11,120
pretty significant reactogenicity, probably going to have fever, probably going to feel crummy,

299
0:29:11,120 --> 0:29:17,600
probably going to have a little bit increased breathing. So yeah, no, this is not a straightforward

300
0:29:17,600 --> 0:29:23,120
decision. And I think this is one of those reasons why I'm not a huge fan of sort of the convention

301
0:29:23,120 --> 0:29:28,240
center mass vaccination site. This is an individual ideally, as you are bringing up,

302
0:29:28,240 --> 0:29:33,840
who has this conversation with her physician, with her family. And then if they're going to be a

303
0:29:33,840 --> 0:29:37,840
progression to get the vaccinations, this is someone you want to keep an eye on.

304
0:29:37,840 --> 0:29:41,600
Matthew Hospital, my mother was there recently out in Port Jefferson.

305
0:29:41,600 --> 0:29:42,640
Yeah, Port Jeff, right.

306
0:29:42,640 --> 0:29:44,000
I'm sure why you went to Florida.

307
0:29:44,000 --> 0:29:49,840
That is COVID-19 clinical update number 50 with Dr. Daniel Griffin. Thank you, Daniel.

308
0:29:49,840 --> 0:30:08,160
Oh, thank you. And everyone, be safe for almost there. Things are getting better.
