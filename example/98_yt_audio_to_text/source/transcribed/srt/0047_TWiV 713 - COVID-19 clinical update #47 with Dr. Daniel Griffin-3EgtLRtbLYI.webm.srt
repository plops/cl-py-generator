0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:06,880
This week in virology, the podcast about viruses, the kind that make you sick.

2
0:00:10,320 --> 0:00:20,240
From Microbe TV, this is Twib, this week in virology, episode 713 recorded on January 29,

3
0:00:20,240 --> 0:00:27,360
2021. I'm Vincent Rackeniello, and you're listening to the podcast all about viruses.

4
0:00:27,360 --> 0:00:33,360
Joining me today from New York, Daniel Griffin. Hello, everyone.

5
0:00:33,360 --> 0:00:41,440
How'd your immunization go, Daniel? It went incredibly well. We're getting consistently 12

6
0:00:41,440 --> 0:00:46,880
doses per vial, so actually it got even a little bit extra last night. I was able to,

7
0:00:46,880 --> 0:00:53,120
with five vials, vaccinate 62 people. Wow, good job. There's something for me like,

8
0:00:53,120 --> 0:00:57,120
I am exhausted, but then I vaccinate that many people, and I'm full of all this energy. I can't

9
0:00:57,120 --> 0:01:03,520
sleep. I just like settle down. It's okay. Nice. Very good. But all right, we got a lot to cover

10
0:01:03,520 --> 0:01:10,240
today. So let me start with my quotation. There are no problems, only solutions. And I think that's

11
0:01:10,240 --> 0:01:17,120
from a song by John Lennon. All right, I have my three rules, and I keep updating these. Never

12
0:01:17,120 --> 0:01:24,320
miss an opportunity to vaccinate, never miss an opportunity to test, and never waste a vaccine dose.

13
0:01:25,360 --> 0:01:31,520
My view is every vaccine dose is a chance to save a life. So we got to get those into arms.

14
0:01:31,520 --> 0:01:37,520
So we have a lot of exciting new information to share. So start with active vaccination.

15
0:01:37,520 --> 0:01:44,800
So a quick update on the Novavax protein-based vaccine candidate. We have some interim analysis

16
0:01:44,800 --> 0:01:49,600
in the form of a press release. So because we're getting used to that. And it's sort of funny

17
0:01:49,600 --> 0:01:56,800
because you read it through and obviously the PR department was involved. So what is this Novavax

18
0:01:56,800 --> 0:02:06,240
vaccine? So it contains a full-length, pre-fusion spike protein made using the Novavax recombinant

19
0:02:06,240 --> 0:02:11,440
nanoparticle technology. Now I'm not getting paid by them. And the company's proprietary

20
0:02:11,440 --> 0:02:18,240
saponin-based matrix M adjuvant. Basically what they do is they've got the they've got the

21
0:02:18,240 --> 0:02:24,080
spike protein that they purify. It's made in insect cells, which is actually kind of interesting

22
0:02:24,080 --> 0:02:30,080
because you know I know my two daughters are pretty much vegan. So this might be something they can

23
0:02:30,080 --> 0:02:36,480
use. There's no replication. It's really just the protein. And think of it as like a flower,

24
0:02:36,480 --> 0:02:42,480
right? With the spikes all sticking out from the center. And this study enrolled over 15,000

25
0:02:42,480 --> 0:02:49,520
participants from 18 to 84 years of age. About a quarter of them were over the age of 65.

26
0:02:50,560 --> 0:02:57,760
And the primary endpoint was PCR confirmed, symptomatic mild moderate or severe COVID-19.

27
0:02:58,560 --> 0:03:03,680
And it had to be seven days after the second study vaccination. So this is something we're

28
0:03:03,680 --> 0:03:08,160
going to talk about. When do you start looking? When do you say it's time to judge the efficacy?

29
0:03:08,960 --> 0:03:13,440
So I would say seven days seems to me a little bit early. But I think they were very confident.

30
0:03:13,440 --> 0:03:18,960
They wanted to kind of get some data out here. And the preliminary data suggested that the

31
0:03:18,960 --> 0:03:25,280
Novavax protein-based vaccine efficacy, and they break it down by strain, right? So it's calculated

32
0:03:25,280 --> 0:03:38,000
to be 95.6% efficacy against the original COVID-19 strain, 85.6% against the UK variant strain,

33
0:03:38,720 --> 0:03:45,600
but only 50% against the South African strain. We'll talk a little bit more about the terminology

34
0:03:45,600 --> 0:03:49,840
strain and variant, but that's what they're saying. This first interim analysis was based

35
0:03:49,840 --> 0:03:58,880
only on 62 cases, right? So this is a preliminary interim analysis. 56 of those cases of COVID-19

36
0:03:58,880 --> 0:04:05,600
were in the placebo group. Six of them were in the people that got this protein-based vaccine.

37
0:04:06,480 --> 0:04:13,040
So overall, you had an efficacy of about 89.3%. There was only one severe case, and that was in

38
0:04:13,040 --> 0:04:20,560
the placebo group. So we're starting to see this consistent, really good efficacy if your end point

39
0:04:20,560 --> 0:04:25,120
is keeping people from ending up with severe COVID, keeping people from dying from COVID.

40
0:04:25,760 --> 0:04:30,400
And this is one of, I'll say, tried-and-true technology, right? This is the vaccine technology

41
0:04:30,400 --> 0:04:38,560
that's used for the new shingrix, the new shingles shot. So more to come. Also, my gosh,

42
0:04:38,560 --> 0:04:43,920
this was vaccine day. So maybe I forgot to give my, you know, get off the flight if you don't

43
0:04:43,920 --> 0:04:48,720
want to hear about vaccines. This is not for you. Spend your time somewhere else. You know,

44
0:04:48,720 --> 0:04:55,760
if you want to send those angry emails, anti-vaxx, or emails at peterhotes.com, I think is where you

45
0:04:55,760 --> 0:05:01,920
send us. J&J vector vaccine. So I've been waiting for this. I thought I was going to have to wait

46
0:05:01,920 --> 0:05:08,320
till Tuesday. So I was excited to have this come out. We keep getting these questions,

47
0:05:08,320 --> 0:05:13,360
and I think I was joking with one of my colleagues today. When is the normal vaccine coming out?

48
0:05:13,360 --> 0:05:18,960
When's the one we just get one shot and you're done? And so, yes, we're getting information here.

49
0:05:18,960 --> 0:05:25,680
So J&J reported that they had met their primary end points in the interim analysis of phase 3.

50
0:05:25,680 --> 0:05:29,440
And again, we got a press release. So we're going to get peer reviewed. We're going to get

51
0:05:29,440 --> 0:05:36,160
more data. And this is going to go, we think, to the FDA soon. Safety and efficacy data based on

52
0:05:36,160 --> 0:05:46,480
43,783 participants. And here we have 468 symptomatic cases. So this is pretty robust data.

53
0:05:47,440 --> 0:05:52,080
So many more cases, you know, here, compared to some of the other ones, right? We were talking

54
0:05:52,080 --> 0:06:00,720
about 100, 118 or so. Here, we have data four weeks after vaccination. And I do want to remind

55
0:06:00,720 --> 0:06:06,720
people that what we learned about from the J&J vaccine, it really takes about eight weeks to get

56
0:06:06,720 --> 0:06:15,600
those antibodies up at 100% of people. So what's the data going to be here? So J&J vaccine,

57
0:06:16,160 --> 0:06:23,280
they report was 85% effective in preventing severe disease across all regions studied,

58
0:06:23,280 --> 0:06:27,600
right? So I'm sort of pointing out that's what we're really concerned about. You know, if someone

59
0:06:27,600 --> 0:06:32,960
gets a little bit of the sniffles and more or less or the mild disease, so looking at keeping people

60
0:06:32,960 --> 0:06:39,040
from ending up with severe disease, keeping people from dying 85% efficacy in all the regions studied

61
0:06:39,040 --> 0:06:45,840
as early as 28 days. And then efficacy against severe disease increased over time to 100%

62
0:06:47,040 --> 0:06:53,200
at day 49, so about seven weeks. So we're only seeing very limited information in this press

63
0:06:53,200 --> 0:06:59,440
release. I'll get back to this when we get more. But what's exciting here is this is an inexpensive,

64
0:06:59,440 --> 0:07:04,160
it's established vaccine technology that's been used hundreds of thousands of people have received

65
0:07:04,160 --> 0:07:10,000
vaccines with this technology. Basically, the safety data, there was nothing, nothing there.

66
0:07:10,560 --> 0:07:14,640
The reactogenicity profile, this is kind of what people were saying. I want to get a shot like

67
0:07:14,640 --> 0:07:19,440
the flu shot, where the only reason I know I got it is because someone poked me with a needle and

68
0:07:19,440 --> 0:07:25,440
they put a sticker on my card or something. But we're going to get more data as we go forward.

69
0:07:25,440 --> 0:07:32,720
But I have to say it was nice to get this data this morning. Before I do FAQs on vaccines,

70
0:07:32,720 --> 0:07:36,480
frequently asked questions, I really want to get a little bit into the weeds. And I was

71
0:07:36,480 --> 0:07:41,120
one of my people that, you know, primary for me, the way this started was using this as a chance to

72
0:07:41,120 --> 0:07:46,880
get all the tri-state physicians that Pro Health New York and other physicians, Riverside

73
0:07:46,880 --> 0:07:53,040
and Pro Health Connecticut providers up to speed on what we need to know. But I'm going to call

74
0:07:53,040 --> 0:07:58,160
this part here. I'm going to call it the Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders approach. You need a plan,

75
0:07:58,160 --> 0:08:02,160
you need to make sure everyone gets the vaccine. But I'm also going to call it the Biden

76
0:08:02,160 --> 0:08:09,200
Buttigieg vaccines for everyone who wants them only at this point. Before you order any vaccines,

77
0:08:09,840 --> 0:08:12,960
you want to have a vaccine reaction kit. You know, you want to have your Benadryl,

78
0:08:12,960 --> 0:08:17,920
you want to have your epinephrine, and then you want to have a plan. If you're going to be opening

79
0:08:17,920 --> 0:08:22,960
a bio, you're going to get 10, 11 or 12 doses, you want to make sure you have a plan for who's

80
0:08:22,960 --> 0:08:28,000
going to get those. And you also want to have a plan for what if someone has a reaction, you know,

81
0:08:28,000 --> 0:08:33,680
with the mRNA vaccines, about 1 in 100,000 people are having reactions, you want to have a plan for

82
0:08:33,680 --> 0:08:39,040
what you're going to do. So let's go through. Part of this, I'll say, you know, conversations

83
0:08:39,040 --> 0:08:43,440
with people and one of the nurses I've been working with was saying, you know, actually just a week

84
0:08:43,440 --> 0:08:48,000
ago, when we started doing some re vaccinations, you know, we're thinking about getting this in

85
0:08:48,000 --> 0:08:52,640
the office, but you know, we just don't have a freezer, so we're not sure. And so let's go through. You

86
0:08:52,640 --> 0:08:59,120
don't need a freezer, you need arms. The Moderna, it arrives frozen. So you just put in the refrigerator,

87
0:08:59,120 --> 0:09:04,640
yes, a normal medical office refrigerator, and it can stay in there for up to 30 days.

88
0:09:04,640 --> 0:09:10,400
I'm not sure there's any reason with the supply relative demand that any vaccine should sit for

89
0:09:10,400 --> 0:09:16,480
30 days in that fridge, but it can. No freezer required. Once in the refrigerator, just leave it

90
0:09:16,480 --> 0:09:22,400
there. Don't put it back in the freezer. It can couple hours and it'll defrost in the refrigerator,

91
0:09:22,400 --> 0:09:26,240
but if you're ready to start vaccinating, you can just take it out, let it sit at room temperature.

92
0:09:26,240 --> 0:09:30,400
For an hour, it's ready to go. Once it's been in the fridge, you only need about 15 minutes out

93
0:09:30,400 --> 0:09:37,040
before you're ready to go. So once you pull out the vial, again, reinforce, have a plan.

94
0:09:37,840 --> 0:09:41,920
If you've got 10 people scheduled and only age show up, have a plan for what you're going to do

95
0:09:41,920 --> 0:09:47,440
with those last two. If you've got a couple doses, have a call, have a call list and plan, like,

96
0:09:47,440 --> 0:09:51,840
don't be like, Oh my gosh, I got to leave at nine for some important date. Don't let those vaccines

97
0:09:51,840 --> 0:09:57,520
go to waste, have a plan. Call on the phone, make sure people are going to come. Once you pull that

98
0:09:57,520 --> 0:10:03,600
vial out of the refrigerator, we're talking about Moderna here, you have 12 hours, just keeping that

99
0:10:03,600 --> 0:10:10,240
at room temperature. Once you puncture the vial, you have six hours puncture the vial. You've got

100
0:10:10,240 --> 0:10:16,240
your syringes ready to go use one ml syringes. I've been posting on Twitter. And if anyone

101
0:10:16,240 --> 0:10:20,800
follow me on Twitter and you'll get my posting on sort of the weeds here, which are the best syringes

102
0:10:20,800 --> 0:10:26,160
to buy, which are the ones so that you get 12 doses per vial instead of 10. That's a 20%

103
0:10:26,160 --> 0:10:32,480
increase in the number of doses. That's huge. And once you once you put these shots in arms,

104
0:10:32,480 --> 0:10:38,160
you observe people for 15 minutes. It doesn't have to be one person at a time. You can actually

105
0:10:38,160 --> 0:10:45,200
look at multiple people at the same time. So often last night, we did, as I mentioned, 62 individuals.

106
0:10:45,840 --> 0:10:50,000
This is actually, for a lot of us, the biggest logistical challenge, where do all those people

107
0:10:50,000 --> 0:10:54,800
wait so you can keep an eye on them? Most people were telling them, set your iPhone,

108
0:10:54,800 --> 0:11:00,800
set your smartphone. It's okay if you have an Android. For 15 minutes, when your alarm goes off,

109
0:11:00,800 --> 0:11:06,960
that's great. A little bit of an oddity. The expiration date is not on the bottles or the box.

110
0:11:06,960 --> 0:11:12,960
You actually have to go to the website and input the lot number. And then you get this date,

111
0:11:12,960 --> 0:11:17,600
and you get the expiration date. So a little bit odd. But listen, you don't need a freezer.

112
0:11:17,600 --> 0:11:22,080
All you need is a medical grade refrigerator. Well, what about Pfizer? Oh my gosh, that's

113
0:11:22,080 --> 0:11:28,000
the ultra cold, right? That's these thermal shippers. It arrives frozen and it can stay frozen in

114
0:11:28,000 --> 0:11:33,760
that thermal shipper for up to 30 days. All you have to do is add a little bit of dry ice every

115
0:11:33,760 --> 0:11:40,880
five days. If you take those vials out, you can put them in a normal refrigerator and they can

116
0:11:40,880 --> 0:11:44,880
sit in that refrigerator for up to five days. When they're in that nation, be sitting in that

117
0:11:44,880 --> 0:11:49,600
fridge for up to five days, right? Because we should be getting those into arms. So it's painful to

118
0:11:49,600 --> 0:11:55,760
say, but you can actually keep those for 35 days from the time you receive the thermal shipper,

119
0:11:55,760 --> 0:11:59,760
right? Every five days, you're adding some dry ice. And at the very end, you put them in the

120
0:11:59,760 --> 0:12:04,800
fridge for the last five days. Once you put them in the refrigerator, it takes a couple hours to

121
0:12:04,800 --> 0:12:09,840
thaw. So give yourself an amount of time, you know, and pull them straight out of the freezer.

122
0:12:09,840 --> 0:12:14,640
If you put them at room temperature, about 30 minutes. But once once they're thawed, you can

123
0:12:14,640 --> 0:12:18,880
pull them out. Once you pull them out, you have about two hours before you do the dilution. And

124
0:12:18,880 --> 0:12:23,840
again, you're going to run into that same once you've diluted them, you're going to get six doses

125
0:12:23,840 --> 0:12:29,520
per vial. If you use the proper syringes, you've got six hours once you mix them up, load your

126
0:12:29,520 --> 0:12:35,520
syringes ready to go. All right, now we've got our FAQs. Some of these are fun. I have to say,

127
0:12:35,520 --> 0:12:40,240
I'm entertained by the questions. But some of them actually speak to a little bit of, I'm going to

128
0:12:40,240 --> 0:12:47,600
say carelessness. What do we do if a person gets a vaccine and they feel crummy for one day,

129
0:12:47,600 --> 0:12:52,800
for two days, for three days? That's a magic rule. We have been noticing, unfortunately,

130
0:12:52,800 --> 0:12:58,080
that some people come in, and they actually have already been exposed. And on day three,

131
0:12:58,080 --> 0:13:03,440
they're still feeling crummy. At that point is when you say we can't just chalk this all up to

132
0:13:03,440 --> 0:13:08,400
react to genicity. And you want to do that COVID test. We've actually had some individuals,

133
0:13:08,400 --> 0:13:12,000
actually several times this has happened. We were talking about this in the urgent care call,

134
0:13:12,000 --> 0:13:18,640
where the whole family comes in. And then they all are there to get vaccinated and turns out

135
0:13:18,640 --> 0:13:24,000
someone in the group feels crummy, comes back later that day or the next day, and then tests

136
0:13:24,000 --> 0:13:30,560
positive. So the rule we're using, test as often as you can. This is an opportunity to test.

137
0:13:31,120 --> 0:13:36,000
We know five to 10% of people that are getting tested are coming back positive. So think about,

138
0:13:36,000 --> 0:13:41,600
you know, you open two vials, probably one or two people are that you're vaccinating is already

139
0:13:41,600 --> 0:13:45,760
positive. They want to know that so that they don't spread it to their families. We can prevent

140
0:13:45,760 --> 0:13:52,080
infections. Once they get the vaccine, 48 hours is typical. If they're feeling crummy at day three,

141
0:13:52,080 --> 0:13:56,960
then you want to evaluate why are they feeling crummy may not be from the vaccine. All right,

142
0:13:56,960 --> 0:14:03,920
I got vaccinated, but my antibody test came back negative. Okay, this is Twiv. So you're going to

143
0:14:03,920 --> 0:14:10,000
get a little bit of nitty gritty science here. When you're getting vaccinated, you are getting

144
0:14:10,000 --> 0:14:15,760
the spike protein so that you can make antibodies against the spike protein. Now,

145
0:14:15,760 --> 0:14:22,000
the end protein is actually the most abundantly produced immunodominant protein. So most of

146
0:14:22,000 --> 0:14:26,800
those tests out there, those serology tests, like the Roche, for instance, they're testing

147
0:14:26,800 --> 0:14:32,400
for antibodies against the end protein. So let's think about it. If I give you spike protein and

148
0:14:32,400 --> 0:14:37,120
you make antibodies against the spike protein, but I send you for a test looking for antibodies

149
0:14:37,120 --> 0:14:42,240
against the end protein, the nucleocapsid protein, it's going to come back negative.

150
0:14:43,200 --> 0:14:48,160
So just to throw it out there, we do not recommending checking serologies. We certainly

151
0:14:48,160 --> 0:14:54,000
don't recommend checking the wrong serologies. So if you do want to check serologies for some

152
0:14:54,000 --> 0:14:58,400
crazy reason, send them to someone with a little bit of a sophisticated understanding.

153
0:14:58,400 --> 0:15:06,480
And then they're going to need a quantitative S protein antibody test. Do I still need to wear

154
0:15:06,480 --> 0:15:12,720
a mask if all my friends have been vaccinated? And so this is this quarantine issue. And I ran

155
0:15:12,720 --> 0:15:19,120
into my buddy Jay Burger the other day, and I ran the scenario by him. I said, so Jay, you know,

156
0:15:19,120 --> 0:15:25,440
I know you want to hang out with me. But what if this? What if you and I and our buddy Conan,

157
0:15:25,440 --> 0:15:29,360
we get together because Conan bought a liquor store and he's going to treat us to this great

158
0:15:29,360 --> 0:15:34,880
new scotch. And we sit around and we've got our masks off because we've all been vaccinated and

159
0:15:34,880 --> 0:15:41,680
we're so excited. And then Conan ends up getting a test the next day because his mother-in-law is

160
0:15:41,680 --> 0:15:47,040
coming to visit and he's positive. I'm like, Jay, you and I, we're quarantined, we're out of work.

161
0:15:48,000 --> 0:15:53,840
So that's that's part of the issue. We do not know if people who've been vaccinated,

162
0:15:53,840 --> 0:15:58,720
we don't know about transmission yet. We really need to know about that. Why are health care workers

163
0:15:58,720 --> 0:16:04,560
not required to get vaccinated? If people listened to the previous twin with Dixon,

164
0:16:04,560 --> 0:16:10,080
he was getting pretty emotional about this. He obviously feels really strong about this,

165
0:16:10,080 --> 0:16:15,840
but where are we with the science? So Dixon was suggesting, and this gets back almost to that first

166
0:16:15,840 --> 0:16:21,440
question that we just talked about. Dixon suggested that an unvaccinated person was more likely to

167
0:16:21,440 --> 0:16:28,400
transmit the virus to others or the corollary that vaccination reduces the chances of transmission

168
0:16:28,400 --> 0:16:33,600
by a person who's been vaccinated. Now here we actually need to stop and say that we do not know

169
0:16:33,600 --> 0:16:38,960
the answer to this question, but we really do need to know the answer to this question. So we have

170
0:16:38,960 --> 0:16:44,720
very limited data from the vaccine trials with PCR surveillance in hundreds, not thousands of

171
0:16:44,720 --> 0:16:52,000
participants suggesting there may be a reduction in infection and potential transmission. We still

172
0:16:52,000 --> 0:16:58,000
did not know if our current vaccines prevent viral transmission. There was a plan to do a major

173
0:16:58,000 --> 0:17:03,600
study on transmission with the Moderna vaccine led by Larry Corey, a virologist at Fred Hutch,

174
0:17:03,600 --> 0:17:08,320
Cancer Center in Seattle, but they did not get the federal funds. And currently my understanding

175
0:17:08,320 --> 0:17:14,480
is that the study is not going forward. The other issue is that these vaccines are not FDA

176
0:17:14,480 --> 0:17:19,680
approved. So even if we knew the answer to the first question, which I am hopefully we will get

177
0:17:19,680 --> 0:17:26,240
the answer to about transmission, there's a major issue mandating something that's not FDA approved.

178
0:17:26,240 --> 0:17:33,600
So throw that out there. What about these syringes with less dead space? What is that? I think Rich

179
0:17:33,600 --> 0:17:38,720
was talking about that. So I've been tweeting a bunch about this for a while. If you use the

180
0:17:38,720 --> 0:17:46,800
right syringes, you get an extra 20%. So Pfizer, five doses, if they send out their

181
0:17:47,680 --> 0:17:54,160
vials with the right syringes that do get six doses, then they count it as six. If they're sent

182
0:17:54,160 --> 0:17:59,520
out with the crummy syringes, they don't get the count extra. Same with Moderna. I guess I'll say

183
0:17:59,520 --> 0:18:04,400
the same with Moderna right now is sending out with the idea that there are 10 doses per

184
0:18:04,400 --> 0:18:09,760
file. But again, if you use the right syringes, you can get 12, maybe even sometimes more. So

185
0:18:10,400 --> 0:18:14,880
this is not common knowledge, I have to say. So if you're thinking about vaccinating,

186
0:18:14,880 --> 0:18:19,520
you're moving forward with vaccinating, reach out, get some guidance, use the right syringes

187
0:18:19,520 --> 0:18:25,040
because 10 to 20% extra vaccine, that really adds up. Instead of 10 million vaccines,

188
0:18:25,040 --> 0:18:30,560
you got an extra one or two million thrown on top. All right, what about school openings?

189
0:18:30,560 --> 0:18:37,440
I always get in trouble when I talk about this. The MMWR early release came out on the 26

190
0:18:37,440 --> 0:18:46,800
one slash 26 slash 2021 COVID-19 cases and transmission in 17 K through 12 schools in Wisconsin.

191
0:18:47,440 --> 0:18:54,480
So the study involved students, staff members in 17 K through 12 schools in rural Wisconsin,

192
0:18:54,480 --> 0:19:00,960
under the district and statewide mask mandates, and they found that the teachers in the study

193
0:19:00,960 --> 0:19:08,240
reported the students had very high masking compliance. And so despite widespread community

194
0:19:08,240 --> 0:19:14,320
transmission, the rates in the schools, 37% lower than in the surrounding community.

195
0:19:14,960 --> 0:19:22,640
A couple things I want to say, the mask use was reported at greater than 92%. They were using

196
0:19:22,640 --> 0:19:28,640
11 to 20 student cohorts. They were doing physical distancing. They were doing the quarantine

197
0:19:28,640 --> 0:19:35,200
after exposures. And of note, they received funds from a foundation to support this strategy. So

198
0:19:36,080 --> 0:19:41,120
we all want our kids to go to school, but we want the kids. We want the teachers. We want

199
0:19:41,120 --> 0:19:46,160
everyone, all the staff involved to be safe. This takes planning. It takes the strategy. It takes

200
0:19:46,160 --> 0:19:52,240
money. You can't just make it happen. Incubation period post exposure. I just always want to

201
0:19:52,240 --> 0:19:56,480
remind everyone that test doesn't predict the future. So don't go have a test and then think

202
0:19:56,480 --> 0:20:01,520
that you don't have to worry. If you're in the incubation period, a test can be negative today.

203
0:20:01,520 --> 0:20:06,160
It can turn positive tomorrow. Now we have some more. A lot of exciting data this week,

204
0:20:06,160 --> 0:20:14,960
passive vaccination. So monoclonal antibodies for COVID. So from Eli Lilly, we have the paper SARS,

205
0:20:14,960 --> 0:20:22,080
COVID-2, neutralizing antibody, LY, COVID-50, 555, and now patients with COVID-19 in the Newland

206
0:20:22,080 --> 0:20:29,680
Journal. That was 75% reduction in COVID-19. That was the Blaze 1 study. From Regeneron,

207
0:20:29,680 --> 0:20:34,640
we had the original paper in the New England Journal. The Regeneron, COVID-2, and neutralizing

208
0:20:34,640 --> 0:20:41,600
antibody cocktail with a 50% reduction. And then we recently discussed the Blaze 2 study

209
0:20:41,600 --> 0:20:47,040
where bamlin imamab decreased infections by 80% in long-term care facility residents.

210
0:20:47,680 --> 0:20:51,760
And the only deaths were in the placebo arm. This is when we were doing it pre-exposure.

211
0:20:52,320 --> 0:20:56,800
But we got a couple new things today. So we have cocktail data from Eli Lilly.

212
0:20:57,840 --> 0:21:03,840
And this was the effect of bamlin imamab as monotherapy or in combination with

213
0:21:04,560 --> 0:21:09,360
a test of a map. Now they should have thrown an L and it could have been a Tesla the map,

214
0:21:09,360 --> 0:21:14,960
but it's not. It would have solved better, I think, on viral load in patients with mild and moderate

215
0:21:14,960 --> 0:21:22,880
COVID-19. So really what this was is they continued sort of a second part of the Blaze 1 study data.

216
0:21:23,920 --> 0:21:29,840
And they were looking at the proportion of patients with COVID-19 related hospitalizations

217
0:21:29,840 --> 0:21:40,480
or ED visits, 5.8% for placebo, 0.9% for the cocktail. So an 84% reduction in COVID-19 related

218
0:21:40,480 --> 0:21:46,800
hospitalizations or ED visits. There are no deaths in the study, so we can't really assess that as well.

219
0:21:47,920 --> 0:21:53,520
Regeneron has got more to tell us, more another press release about their cocktail.

220
0:21:53,520 --> 0:22:00,480
And this is using the cocktail to prevent you from getting COVID-19. And who wouldn't want

221
0:22:00,480 --> 0:22:08,560
to have a cocktail and not get COVID-19? So they looked at 400 individuals. They were randomized

222
0:22:08,560 --> 0:22:16,400
to receive the passive immunization with the Regeneron COVID-2 cocktail. And this was subcutaneous,

223
0:22:16,400 --> 0:22:24,000
right? So what we hear from this press release is passive vaccination with the Regeneron cocktail

224
0:22:24,000 --> 0:22:31,840
resulted in a 100% prevention of symptomatic infection and a 50% lower rate of any infection

225
0:22:31,840 --> 0:22:35,760
at all. And there actually are some pretty exciting things I'm going to go through here.

226
0:22:36,560 --> 0:22:41,600
So the lower number of infections that did happen in the Regeneron COVID-2 therapy,

227
0:22:41,600 --> 0:22:46,880
they were all asymptomatic. So right, 100% prevention of symptomatic in this study. The

228
0:22:46,880 --> 0:22:54,800
infections that did occur in the placebo group had on average more than 100 fold higher peak viral

229
0:22:54,800 --> 0:23:02,320
load in the placebo group than in the vaccinated group. So two log difference. The infections that

230
0:23:02,320 --> 0:23:08,720
did happen in the people that got the cocktail, none of them lasted more than a week where the

231
0:23:08,720 --> 0:23:14,640
people in the placebo group, 40% of them were lasting three to four weeks. No infected individuals

232
0:23:15,600 --> 0:23:23,440
in the cocktail group had viral loads above 10 to the fourth compared to about 62% in the placebo

233
0:23:23,440 --> 0:23:29,920
group. So Regeneron COVID-2 cocktail, given ahead of time, was associated with fewer total viral

234
0:23:29,920 --> 0:23:36,720
shedding weeks, fewer total high viral shedding weeks. So for a recap, the data on the monoclonal

235
0:23:36,720 --> 0:23:43,120
is pre exposure. We have it post exposure. You don't want to give it late. You want to give it early.

236
0:23:43,120 --> 0:23:47,600
And here, I think you're seeing some sort of interesting suggestion that 10 to the fourth,

237
0:23:47,600 --> 0:23:52,640
we're actually thinking that may be below the level of transmission. So people who get high

238
0:23:52,640 --> 0:23:56,480
antibodies, whether they're being given in a cocktail or we're hoping with vaccines,

239
0:23:56,480 --> 0:24:02,080
we are hoping that even if they get infected, that it's going to be resulting in interruption

240
0:24:02,080 --> 0:24:07,520
of transmission. All right, now this, I was so excited about this, but then I became less excited

241
0:24:07,520 --> 0:24:12,720
and then less excited. So this was the Cole Corona study, which we finally saw as a pre-print.

242
0:24:13,440 --> 0:24:18,240
And some really clever person did a little tweet. And they've got like this really like

243
0:24:18,240 --> 0:24:24,640
muscle bound ripped man. And that was the press release. And then they had the abstract,

244
0:24:24,640 --> 0:24:28,880
which was a guy who maybe hadn't been hitting the gym quite as often. And then they had the

245
0:24:28,880 --> 0:24:32,800
results. And it was a guy with the belly hanging over the belt. And that's kind of how I'm feeling

246
0:24:32,800 --> 0:24:38,880
here. So this was a study looking at the efficacy of culture scene in non hospitalized patients with

247
0:24:38,880 --> 0:24:44,720
COVID-19. And as mentioned, we're looking at a pre-prints and not peer reviewed. So this was a

248
0:24:44,720 --> 0:24:50,320
randomized double blind placebo control clinical trial conducted in China in Canada, the United

249
0:24:50,320 --> 0:24:55,120
States, Europe, South America, and South Africa. And it was designed to determine whether

250
0:24:55,120 --> 0:24:59,680
culture scene would reduce the risk of severe complications associated with COVID-19.

251
0:25:00,560 --> 0:25:04,480
And there's some interesting, I'll say background theory on all kinds of ideas about how culture

252
0:25:04,480 --> 0:25:10,240
scene might work, might interfere with the microtubules, might affect the virus, might do immune

253
0:25:10,240 --> 0:25:18,160
modulation. But they ended up they enrolled 4,488 COVID-19 patients, non hospitalized at the time

254
0:25:18,160 --> 0:25:25,200
of enrollment. They ended up analyzing 4,159 patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19.

255
0:25:26,640 --> 0:25:33,520
And those patients with a proven diagnosis of COVID-19 on culture scene versus placebo

256
0:25:33,520 --> 0:25:43,360
hospitalizations, 4.5 versus 5.9. The need for mechanical ventilation, 0.5 versus 0.9 deaths,

257
0:25:43,360 --> 0:25:50,560
0.2 versus 0.4. Nothing reaching statistical significance until you start lumping stuff together.

258
0:25:51,440 --> 0:25:57,200
But then I will add that 13.7% of the culture scene patients developed diarrhea and that added

259
0:25:57,200 --> 0:26:04,400
p value of less than 0.001. So we did reach statistical significance in giving people diarrhea. But

260
0:26:05,440 --> 0:26:13,280
little disappointing looking at over 4,000 patients and seeing this, you know, 0.2 versus 0.4 as far as

261
0:26:13,280 --> 0:26:17,200
death. So I was a little bit disappointed. I was pretty excited that we were going to see

262
0:26:17,200 --> 0:26:23,040
something here based on the press release. Now there's a lot of data coming out and I'm sort of

263
0:26:23,040 --> 0:26:31,040
getting the preliminary stuff on the ATT ACC, the ACTI 4A and the REM CAP studies looking at

264
0:26:31,040 --> 0:26:36,800
anti-coagulation. I've had a chance to look at the interim data so far. But I'm going to put

265
0:26:36,800 --> 0:26:40,880
that on the back burner. That's something we're going to talk about next week. To finish off

266
0:26:40,880 --> 0:26:45,840
with the tail phase, I always want to talk about the tail phase. More information about how long

267
0:26:45,840 --> 0:26:51,760
COVID patients have autoantibodies, suggestions that this may be tied into some of the symptoms.

268
0:26:52,400 --> 0:26:57,440
This is evolving, so we'll get back to that when I know more. But all right, our fundraiser,

269
0:26:57,440 --> 0:27:01,920
we're still, this is our final episode, encouraging people to help us support

270
0:27:02,800 --> 0:27:08,480
the P-Scores HIV and AIDS programs. Thank you so much for all the support we've gotten.

271
0:27:08,480 --> 0:27:14,800
Look forward to supporting the men. We have a very exciting upcoming fundraiser that will start

272
0:27:14,800 --> 0:27:19,760
February and March. But I'm going to leave everyone in suspense and we'll announce that next time.

273
0:27:20,960 --> 0:27:25,920
Daniel, after the last two of you talked about where we talked about immunization of healthcare

274
0:27:25,920 --> 0:27:30,400
workers, I got an angry email saying, how dare you think we don't know how to prevent getting

275
0:27:30,400 --> 0:27:36,000
infection? But weren't the healthcare workers on the priority vaccination group and wouldn't you

276
0:27:36,000 --> 0:27:40,560
want them to stay healthy so that they can keep working? You know, I think that's really interesting,

277
0:27:40,560 --> 0:27:45,360
right? They know how to stay. Is it getting vaccinated the way and washing your hands?

278
0:27:47,520 --> 0:27:51,920
You know, I have to say, it's really, it's really a shame. There's a large healthcare system

279
0:27:51,920 --> 0:27:56,240
bias, you know, and it's made of a lot of different hospitals and each hospital has sort of a different

280
0:27:56,240 --> 0:28:01,760
culture also to, I'll say, you know, and that healthcare system, what majority of the people

281
0:28:01,760 --> 0:28:07,440
working there don't want to get vaccinated, which shocks me. I remember the time their flagship

282
0:28:07,440 --> 0:28:14,000
hospital got scolded because nobody washes their hands. I mean, it's just like, come on. So yeah,

283
0:28:14,000 --> 0:28:18,720
all right, send send us the angry emails. Remember, that's at peterhotes.com.

284
0:28:21,120 --> 0:28:27,520
We have an email from Bhavna in Delhi, India, whose parents got COVID in November. And he's

285
0:28:27,520 --> 0:28:32,640
concerned. His parents are doctors. They're going to get vaccinated AstraZeneca, but he's

286
0:28:32,640 --> 0:28:38,320
concerned about his dad taking it so soon. I can't find any substantial data on how people who had

287
0:28:38,320 --> 0:28:44,640
moderate to severe disease a few months ago react to the vaccine. So some advice for Bhavna.

288
0:28:45,760 --> 0:28:50,640
Yeah, we talked about this a little bit last time and this goes into my never miss an opportunity

289
0:28:50,640 --> 0:28:55,200
to immunize. So if your dad is the opportunity to get a vaccine, go ahead and get that vaccine

290
0:28:55,200 --> 0:29:00,720
for your dad. The CDC recommends no minimal interval between the time you've been vaccinated,

291
0:29:00,720 --> 0:29:05,840
and the time you've been infected, and when you get a vaccine. Now, I know some of my colleagues

292
0:29:05,840 --> 0:29:10,640
say, Oh, you know, wait a few months. Do not miss the opportunity to vaccinate. We've now

293
0:29:10,640 --> 0:29:16,560
vaccinated millions of people. Lots of them had COVID before I personally vaccinated,

294
0:29:16,560 --> 0:29:21,440
you know, lots of people that had their fine. We are not seeing any signal to suggest that

295
0:29:21,440 --> 0:29:26,960
people who have been infected before are going to end up having problems with the vaccine or do

296
0:29:26,960 --> 0:29:35,200
have anymore. Last night, I vaccinated a gentleman who was on the ventilator for 55 days. He's now

297
0:29:35,200 --> 0:29:41,280
better. When I vaccinated him, he cried tears of joy. He and his wife were just so relieved. This

298
0:29:41,280 --> 0:29:47,360
was his second dose. And I said two weeks, keep yourselves two weeks, you're almost there.

299
0:29:47,360 --> 0:29:51,680
Keep going. So yeah, particularly, Oh my gosh, people who've been sick before.

300
0:29:52,480 --> 0:29:55,760
Let's get them vaccinated because you do not want to have a second infection.

301
0:29:56,400 --> 0:30:00,160
And we're seeing the data. Yeah, you're you're unlikely to get infected in the first three months.

302
0:30:00,960 --> 0:30:05,520
Your chance increases by six months. And as we go farther out, we're seeing people get

303
0:30:05,520 --> 0:30:10,880
reinfected. Let's make sure we vaccinate these people. The CDC says there's no reason to wait.

304
0:30:10,880 --> 0:30:14,240
I say there's no reason to wait. The science says there's no reason to wait.

305
0:30:14,240 --> 0:30:22,240
David in the UK asks with a further trial showing advantage and survival for toselism map. Do you

306
0:30:22,240 --> 0:30:26,240
think your clinical practice will change reading between the lines? It seems to be in combination

307
0:30:26,240 --> 0:30:32,960
with steroids as you have long suggested. Yeah, I have to say, dude, my practice hasn't

308
0:30:32,960 --> 0:30:36,960
necessarily changed. Interesting enough. I mean, we've we've talked about this early on sort of

309
0:30:36,960 --> 0:30:41,280
our experience that you don't want to give it without steroids. You want to give it in a

310
0:30:41,280 --> 0:30:46,400
background so that people have been on steroids. And if that person escalates to high flow nasal

311
0:30:46,400 --> 0:30:50,960
cannula, they're heading towards the ICU, you think they're going to require intubation.

312
0:30:50,960 --> 0:30:55,920
I think our experience and now the science is pretty clear that the right patient the right

313
0:30:55,920 --> 0:31:04,320
time toselism map reduces people that require mechanical ventilation. It reduces your chance

314
0:31:04,320 --> 0:31:07,920
of death actually with mortality benefits if used in the right patient with the right

315
0:31:07,920 --> 0:31:12,800
background of steroids at the right time. But I have to say, it's really difficult. And we talked

316
0:31:12,800 --> 0:31:19,200
about this on the ash guidelines meeting this week. A lot of people are suddenly sort of put

317
0:31:19,200 --> 0:31:23,760
into positions of power and decision making that they were not used to that they did not

318
0:31:23,760 --> 0:31:28,480
have before and maybe didn't have the experience for people that never sat on a guideline panel.

319
0:31:28,480 --> 0:31:33,680
So they see guidelines and they say, no, no, these are the rules. We are really careful and we're

320
0:31:33,680 --> 0:31:38,800
talking about when we publish our guidelines coming up that we're going to actually put in

321
0:31:38,800 --> 0:31:43,440
a line where we say the qualification, we feel like people don't quite understand guidelines saying,

322
0:31:43,440 --> 0:31:50,160
these are guidelines, but you should be caring for your patients based upon the most recent,

323
0:31:50,160 --> 0:31:56,000
the most available, the most up-to-date data. So I had a painful conversation about a weekend

324
0:31:56,000 --> 0:31:59,760
back. I ended up with a medical director at a hospital where I don't spend a lot of time and

325
0:31:59,760 --> 0:32:05,680
either an endocrinologist, renal doc, I forget his specialty. And he was aware of some of the

326
0:32:05,680 --> 0:32:09,680
latest head. He said, oh, we're aware of their stuff out there. We're going to probably meet next

327
0:32:09,680 --> 0:32:14,560
month and discuss it. I really haven't taken the time to go through it, but I'm not going to

328
0:32:14,560 --> 0:32:21,120
authorize Tostalizumev on this patient who actually laid it that day ended up ventilated in the ICU.

329
0:32:21,120 --> 0:32:26,160
And so it's a little bit difficult. I have to say, from my perspective, as a specialist,

330
0:32:26,160 --> 0:32:31,360
to see that a lot of institutions want one-size-fits-all and decisions are being made about patient

331
0:32:31,360 --> 0:32:37,600
care, I think not really appreciating what is the latest data. If my family members in the hospital

332
0:32:37,600 --> 0:32:41,520
and there's an expert in the field who's keeping up on the literature and making decisions,

333
0:32:41,520 --> 0:32:45,440
that's quite a bit different than something being managed by an administrator.

334
0:32:45,440 --> 0:32:49,760
Carson writes, is there any known correlation between a person's reaction to a vaccine and

335
0:32:49,760 --> 0:32:54,640
the strength of that person's immune response to a person who gets vaccinated and has no side

336
0:32:54,640 --> 0:32:58,960
effects be concerned that perhaps they didn't have a significant immune response?

337
0:32:59,520 --> 0:33:03,760
I like that, right? Because we always, when the person has a warm arm and the seven-day

338
0:33:03,760 --> 0:33:09,200
entry, say, oh, you're having a really strong, robust immune response, people respond really

339
0:33:09,200 --> 0:33:13,600
well to these vaccines, whether or not they have any kind of local reactogenicity or not.

340
0:33:13,600 --> 0:33:19,840
So no reason to check anything. These are vaccines with really high efficacy against

341
0:33:19,840 --> 0:33:25,520
severe disease. Yeah, with that, whether or not you have a strong reaction, you should not be

342
0:33:25,520 --> 0:33:32,080
concerned. All right, one more from Julia, who says, can you give us an update on Kawasaki-like

343
0:33:32,080 --> 0:33:36,880
symptoms in children? I haven't heard much about it. Are we seeing it? Do we have any more information?

344
0:33:36,880 --> 0:33:42,400
How are the affected kids six months out from infection? Yeah, so some of the nice things

345
0:33:42,400 --> 0:33:47,440
that have developed over time here is that CDC has really provided good guidance, good links,

346
0:33:47,440 --> 0:33:55,040
and actually, if people are concerned, we had a recent case where it was an adult with multi-inflammatory

347
0:33:55,040 --> 0:34:01,360
syndrome, multi-inflammatory system, adult, so Miss A versus Miss C. And you can get on the phone,

348
0:34:01,360 --> 0:34:06,720
you can reach out to the CDC. There aren't enough cases to say anything in general,

349
0:34:06,720 --> 0:34:12,320
but some of these children have had cardiac issues, so they're being followed by cardiologists on a

350
0:34:12,320 --> 0:34:17,520
regular basis. We're learning a lot. We still only have, as mentioned, about six months of data,

351
0:34:17,520 --> 0:34:23,600
so we'll learn more. This is something we're still seeing, and unfortunately, there's a lot of cases

352
0:34:23,600 --> 0:34:29,120
of COVID in children, and this is one of those, though not common. You start having a really

353
0:34:29,120 --> 0:34:34,720
large population affected, and you start seeing more of these cases. All right, that is COVID-19

354
0:34:34,720 --> 0:34:40,960
clinical update number 47 with Dr. Daniel Griffin. Thank you, Daniel. Oh, thank you so much,

355
0:34:40,960 --> 0:34:45,600
and everybody, be safe.
