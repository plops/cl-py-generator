0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:06,880
This week in virology, the podcast about viruses, the kind that make you sick.

2
0:00:10,400 --> 0:00:20,960
From Microbe TV, this is Twiv. This week in virology, episode 692, recorded on December 10, 2020.

3
0:00:21,520 --> 0:00:27,920
I'm Vincent Rackeniello, and you're listening to the podcast all about viruses. Joining me today

4
0:00:27,920 --> 0:00:35,520
from New York, Daniel Griffin. Hello, everyone. How's it going, Daniel?

5
0:00:37,200 --> 0:00:42,320
Today was a long day. I think it's getting pretty bad, and we'll talk about that. But

6
0:00:43,600 --> 0:00:53,200
let me start with my quotation. Wise men say, only fools rush in, but I can't help falling

7
0:00:53,200 --> 0:00:59,120
in love with you. Now, some of our listeners probably know who that is by. That's Elvis Presley.

8
0:00:59,920 --> 0:01:06,560
What people may not know is that he is referring to the polio vaccine when he wrote that song.

9
0:01:09,040 --> 0:01:13,440
Are we going to exhumed and revaccinate him with SARS-CoV-2 vaccines now?

10
0:01:15,680 --> 0:01:19,040
We probably didn't want to do it on this show, but let's do it. I just want to let everyone

11
0:01:19,040 --> 0:01:24,640
know Elvis is actually still alive, and he's returning for a COVID-19 vaccination next week.

12
0:01:25,680 --> 0:01:31,520
Well, you can see it here, right? No, I'm joking on that. I wish Elvis was still with us. What a

13
0:01:31,520 --> 0:01:37,040
tremendous, talented individual he was. But let's start a little bit. I'll get back to why that

14
0:01:37,040 --> 0:01:41,920
quotation. Why are we not quoting Winston Churchill? Why Elvis Presley? But we will get there. But I

15
0:01:41,920 --> 0:01:46,320
just sort of bring some people up to date, patient updates. Everyone keeps seeing these numbers,

16
0:01:46,320 --> 0:01:54,000
but I like to put a face on the numbers. We actually, Vincent and I were together on a call

17
0:01:55,120 --> 0:02:00,560
about a week ago, actually, this last week. And Shane Crotty was on, and he was talking about

18
0:02:00,560 --> 0:02:06,960
issues with reinfection. There were a couple of physicians on, and Shane Crotty's data is

19
0:02:06,960 --> 0:02:12,560
really great and all. But we're seeing reinfection. I think I've talked about that a few times.

20
0:02:12,560 --> 0:02:18,480
My partner today called me and we discussed it a case. This was a gentleman who was admitted

21
0:02:18,480 --> 0:02:25,760
originally back in March, had a pretty severe case of COVID. And now they're back in the hospital.

22
0:02:25,760 --> 0:02:32,800
They're septic. We did a COVID PCR, and it was positive, right? So pretty hard for me to say that,

23
0:02:32,800 --> 0:02:38,160
wow, what is this? 10 months later, that that's somehow persistent from the March of 2020.

24
0:02:38,160 --> 0:02:43,840
So we're seeing cases and number of physicians were on the call saying, we're seeing these,

25
0:02:43,840 --> 0:02:48,880
but we're busy. We're in the trenches. We don't have samples from March and April to do the genetics.

26
0:02:49,600 --> 0:02:53,920
So this raise a concern. Don't think that just because you had it, you don't have to worry.

27
0:02:53,920 --> 0:02:58,000
There's a certain percent of people that are getting reinfected. We don't know what percent

28
0:02:58,000 --> 0:03:04,720
that is, but we'll see as we go forward. Had another gentleman, and this brought me back to

29
0:03:04,720 --> 0:03:09,040
the Irish patient. I don't know if people remember. People who've been longtime listeners may remember

30
0:03:09,040 --> 0:03:18,000
the Irish patient, a young man in his 30s. And I felt like it was back to March again, admitted

31
0:03:18,000 --> 0:03:25,040
another gentleman in his 30s. No past medical history, really sick. Basically did the same things

32
0:03:25,040 --> 0:03:30,880
that we learned from our Irish patient. The person was so ill that we had to intubate him. We had

33
0:03:30,880 --> 0:03:37,840
to lay him prone. He's really on maximal vent settings. And we're hoping that he's going to make

34
0:03:37,840 --> 0:03:42,960
it through this, but really, really sick. People have another sort of myth perception out there.

35
0:03:42,960 --> 0:03:49,600
Oh, the virus isn't so bad this time. Yeah, it's bad. We're seeing the aftermath of Thanksgiving,

36
0:03:49,600 --> 0:03:54,720
which for me is kind of tough because now we're admitting families, right? And we admitted a couple

37
0:03:54,720 --> 0:04:01,680
sisters. One of them died Monday morning. Her sister's still alive, but on a ventilator.

38
0:04:02,400 --> 0:04:08,000
And today I admitted a mother and she was quite upset because she said, you know what, Dr. Griffin,

39
0:04:08,000 --> 0:04:12,080
don't worry so much about me. What I'm really worried about is my daughter who's right here

40
0:04:12,080 --> 0:04:18,960
in the room with me. The daughter went to see her mother-in-law for Thanksgiving. The mother-in-law

41
0:04:18,960 --> 0:04:25,120
actually fainted on Thanksgiving and then was diagnosed the next day with COVID. They were

42
0:04:25,120 --> 0:04:28,880
trying to help the mother-in-law. Everyone was trying to do the right thing. People were wearing

43
0:04:28,880 --> 0:04:32,240
masks. The mother-in-law was wearing a mask. They took the mask off the mother-in-law,

44
0:04:32,240 --> 0:04:37,440
sort of helped her kind of feel better, got her to the hospital. But that whole event led to her

45
0:04:37,440 --> 0:04:41,760
getting sick. The mother getting sick, basically the whole family is sick. So,

46
0:04:44,320 --> 0:04:48,880
I guess I'll move right into the pre-exposure period with this. I try to keep giving people

47
0:04:48,880 --> 0:04:53,520
the facts so they can make their own decision. You know, it's difficult when people make bad

48
0:04:53,520 --> 0:04:58,160
decisions. And I see the consequences of that. We're here for you. We're going to take care of

49
0:04:58,160 --> 0:05:01,600
you. I'm here to educate you to give you the information you need to make the best decisions.

50
0:05:02,320 --> 0:05:06,000
But just keep these facts in mind when you're thinking about what you're going to do tonight

51
0:05:06,000 --> 0:05:13,200
is Hanukkah. Coming up soon is going to be Christmas, Kwanzaa, New Year. So, people are making plans

52
0:05:13,200 --> 0:05:20,080
now. We had over 3,000 people die in the US just yesterday. Things are really bad out there.

53
0:05:20,080 --> 0:05:24,240
And we're going to get to the fact that the vaccine is really right here on the horizon.

54
0:05:24,240 --> 0:05:28,960
So, let's try to make some good decisions. Also in the pre-exposure period, let's go

55
0:05:28,960 --> 0:05:35,280
back to the schools, right? There was a nice article in the CDC MMWR. This was implementing

56
0:05:35,280 --> 0:05:42,000
mitigation strategies in early care and education settings for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

57
0:05:42,000 --> 0:05:47,280
And you looked at eight states in the period of September through October. And that's the

58
0:05:47,280 --> 0:05:50,880
time to look, right? I mean, I've seen studies where they talk about infections between like

59
0:05:50,880 --> 0:05:56,160
April and September. And schools were closed. I don't really know what, you know, what you make

60
0:05:56,160 --> 0:06:00,880
up stuff with that. But this was a really good article. And, you know, the CDC has been beaten

61
0:06:00,880 --> 0:06:04,480
up a lot, but there's really some great people. And they're really putting some great information

62
0:06:04,480 --> 0:06:12,320
out there for us. And this article described the role of mitigation for Head Start programs. And

63
0:06:12,320 --> 0:06:17,440
people in the US probably know the Head Start, but the rest of the world. This is a really tremendous

64
0:06:17,440 --> 0:06:24,240
program. There's Head Start and Early Head Start. And these are programs for kids five and under.

65
0:06:24,240 --> 0:06:29,200
And it promotes early learning, healthy development among children. And what did they do here? So,

66
0:06:29,200 --> 0:06:35,280
they provided quite a bit of guidance, information on masks, personal protective equipment,

67
0:06:35,280 --> 0:06:40,720
the physical setup. So, you could do this in a safer situation. Supplies for actually maintaining

68
0:06:40,720 --> 0:06:46,560
those healthy environments and operations. They even sort of, actually, there was financial aid

69
0:06:47,120 --> 0:06:52,800
in all this, helping them get additional staff members so that they could have smaller class sizes.

70
0:06:52,800 --> 0:06:58,720
And when they implemented all these programs, they actually saw very few cases of transmission

71
0:06:58,720 --> 0:07:04,480
among the children and the staff members. So, just sort of helpful to see, you know,

72
0:07:04,480 --> 0:07:10,480
we went into this, we didn't know, and we're learning, can we do things that make it safer

73
0:07:10,480 --> 0:07:17,360
to be in these environments? And I think just more information that we can. I always know that this

74
0:07:17,360 --> 0:07:23,120
triggers sort of a wedge issue, sending kids to school or not. And so, I always try to make

75
0:07:23,120 --> 0:07:27,760
the qualification that this tells us that you can do it safely. It doesn't say you are doing it

76
0:07:27,760 --> 0:07:33,360
safely. So, if you're looking at having kids in in-person learning environments, you can't just do

77
0:07:33,360 --> 0:07:38,160
it. You can't just make believe it's, you know, 2018 and stick 30 kids, you know, a couple of

78
0:07:38,160 --> 0:07:43,520
feet away from each other. This was a study showing that you can make it safer with proper

79
0:07:43,520 --> 0:07:48,400
mitigation, with spacing. And now, we're seeing in a lot of areas, they're really introducing

80
0:07:48,960 --> 0:07:54,240
testing, actually, becoming a big issue here in the New York area because, as people probably are

81
0:07:54,240 --> 0:08:00,320
where our rates are really climbing, you know, and I look on the map and I see that where I live,

82
0:08:00,320 --> 0:08:05,120
I now live in a red area. That doesn't mean we're socialists or communists. It means we've got way

83
0:08:05,120 --> 0:08:11,280
too much COVID. So, we need to, if we're going to ask those kids to go to school, if we're going to

84
0:08:11,280 --> 0:08:15,600
ask those teachers to be there and teach our kids, we got to give them the necessary resources,

85
0:08:15,600 --> 0:08:23,200
the necessary guidance. Can't just, can't just send in those folks. All right, vaccines. You know,

86
0:08:23,200 --> 0:08:27,360
Vincent pulled me away. It was like, you know, the Super Bowl, I had gone into extra time,

87
0:08:27,360 --> 0:08:33,600
and then Vincent's like, it's time to record Twiv. So, we'll get what was going on right before I

88
0:08:33,600 --> 0:08:40,400
jumped in is the FDA was having their EUA meeting and discussing what to do with the Pfizer vaccine.

89
0:08:41,120 --> 0:08:44,800
I know a lot of people are thinking actually about the time this drops will know, you know,

90
0:08:44,800 --> 0:08:53,120
the outcome, the final score. And it does look as though there will be an EUA for the Pfizer

91
0:08:53,120 --> 0:08:58,400
vaccine. And the discussion was just about what will be the definition, what will be the confines

92
0:08:58,400 --> 0:09:03,840
of that. So, we'll go through a couple of things here. But before we get into vaccines,

93
0:09:04,560 --> 0:09:09,360
I want to point out we're getting here near the end. You know, we're in the 11th hour. I know

94
0:09:09,360 --> 0:09:15,440
everyone's exhausted, but I want to tell a story. And hopefully this story is something that maybe

95
0:09:15,440 --> 0:09:20,800
gives people a little bit of thought about, my gosh, I've got to keep safe because we're almost

96
0:09:20,800 --> 0:09:27,600
there. So, this is a story that I asked my mother to retell this past week. And it's the story of

97
0:09:27,600 --> 0:09:35,920
my grandfather's best friend, my mother's godfather, Howard Miller. And this takes place. It's 1945.

98
0:09:35,920 --> 0:09:42,320
This is a true story. Howard Miller is at the Rhine River in Europe, right? It's World War II.

99
0:09:42,320 --> 0:09:47,680
He's a captain in the second armored tank division. I don't know if people realize,

100
0:09:47,680 --> 0:09:53,840
but 1945, that was when World War II finally ended. So World War II had just come to an end in

101
0:09:53,840 --> 0:10:00,720
European theater. News of the German surrender is spreading across Europe. This day in 1945,

102
0:10:00,720 --> 0:10:06,560
Howard gets up just like any other day, not knowing that the war is already over. The news has not

103
0:10:06,560 --> 0:10:13,120
gotten to him yet. He's killed by a sniper after the Germans had already surrendered. So,

104
0:10:13,120 --> 0:10:19,840
I feel like this is sort of a message for our listeners. The vaccine, by the time this drops,

105
0:10:20,400 --> 0:10:25,600
the vaccines are here. We're going to start rolling these out. I want people to take a moment

106
0:10:25,600 --> 0:10:33,360
and realize that Tuesday, November 8, 2020 was our modern V day, our modern vaccination day.

107
0:10:34,160 --> 0:10:39,520
And really this week, mankind's war against COVID started to end. And vaccinations have started in

108
0:10:39,520 --> 0:10:45,200
the UK. They're going to be coming here in the US in coming days and weeks. So they're going to

109
0:10:45,200 --> 0:10:50,800
be spreading around the world. All right, let's go to where we are with the vaccine. The UK started

110
0:10:50,800 --> 0:10:56,960
to administer the Pfizer vaccine. Canada approved the Pfizer vaccine. And by the time this dropped,

111
0:10:56,960 --> 0:11:04,000
there will be some sort of an FDA EUA for the vaccine here in the US. Right? As I sort of got

112
0:11:04,000 --> 0:11:08,400
on this, there was the discussion at the FDA, not about whether or not to give approval,

113
0:11:08,400 --> 0:11:13,600
but what qualifications to give approval. So was the vaccine going to be just go ahead,

114
0:11:13,600 --> 0:11:18,320
everyone can have it? Or we'll talk about a couple of the issues that were being discussed.

115
0:11:18,320 --> 0:11:24,400
One was, will there be a lower age? So, for instance, the first question that was put forth

116
0:11:24,960 --> 0:11:35,360
was 16 years of age and up. The bulk of scientific evidence supports the safety and efficacy of

117
0:11:35,360 --> 0:11:42,320
this. But then there were a couple discussions about, well, 16, 17, should we make it 18? Should

118
0:11:42,320 --> 0:11:48,720
there be something about that lower limit of age? The other was, since the plans are in the US to

119
0:11:48,720 --> 0:11:55,360
vaccinate high-risk individuals, so healthcare workers, long-term care facility people first.

120
0:11:56,160 --> 0:12:01,360
Should the EUA be limited to those high-risk groups, allowing more data to be generated before

121
0:12:01,360 --> 0:12:07,200
it goes out to a wider audience? So, we will hear what sort of the final decision is. But

122
0:12:07,200 --> 0:12:12,000
little things that we've learned in the last few days here, there was a 92-page brief

123
0:12:12,640 --> 0:12:17,120
that I actually have to say I enjoyed reading through. And then today was a full day. A lot

124
0:12:17,120 --> 0:12:22,080
of really hard questions asked advisor, nothing surprising, nothing concerning. A couple things

125
0:12:22,080 --> 0:12:27,280
we now know. The vaccine is preservative and adjuvant-free. I almost feel like that should

126
0:12:27,280 --> 0:12:32,240
be on there like advertisements. People are always worried about the vaccines. Is there

127
0:12:32,240 --> 0:12:36,400
some preservative in there that might cause problems? Are there adjuvants that might cause

128
0:12:36,400 --> 0:12:41,520
some sort of issue? And historically, we think of vaccines without adjuvants as maybe being

129
0:12:41,520 --> 0:12:48,880
safer, maybe having less issues. A couple things from the immunology front, the two-dose regimen

130
0:12:48,880 --> 0:12:56,640
elicited a robust neutralization antibody response. The titers were actually comparable and higher

131
0:12:56,640 --> 0:13:01,040
actually than individuals who'd recovered from COVID-19. And in addition, I got some questions

132
0:13:01,040 --> 0:13:09,600
about this the other day, it generated a strong CD4 and CD8 T cell response. There was reduction

133
0:13:09,600 --> 0:13:16,720
in the risk of getting COVID-19 as early as 10 days after the first dose. There were some common

134
0:13:17,760 --> 0:13:24,800
reactogenicity reactions. And we're going to touch on what is reactogenicity. But most people

135
0:13:24,800 --> 0:13:29,600
said, hey, at the injection site, it hurt. Got poked with a needle, was sore there. I'd say

136
0:13:29,600 --> 0:13:34,880
about half the people, a little bit more felt tired for a day or two. Headache was actually quite

137
0:13:34,880 --> 0:13:41,280
common. People feeling sort of muscle aches, chills, joint pain fever. Fever was about 14%.

138
0:13:43,120 --> 0:13:46,880
And one of the things that I mentioned is interesting. I don't know if a lot of people

139
0:13:46,880 --> 0:13:54,560
realize this, but they actually included adolescents down to the 12 and 17-year-old ages. So we had

140
0:13:54,560 --> 0:13:59,600
we had data not just on the older individuals. And that was why this was being discussed.

141
0:13:59,600 --> 0:14:04,720
There actually were adolescents included in the study hundreds of them. So we have data there.

142
0:14:05,520 --> 0:14:11,360
Want to address some of the fears here that were addressed in the last few days. It was

143
0:14:11,360 --> 0:14:15,680
noticed when they went through the thousands of people that got the vaccine that there were four

144
0:14:15,680 --> 0:14:22,720
cases of Bell's palsy in the over 20,000 people that were vaccinated. This is pointed out that's

145
0:14:22,720 --> 0:14:27,760
actually what we see as a background in the population. So that was not above background.

146
0:14:27,760 --> 0:14:31,280
So that was not considered in any way to necessarily be associated with the vaccine.

147
0:14:33,600 --> 0:14:36,880
The other, which is interesting. I don't know if people are following this, but there's this

148
0:14:36,880 --> 0:14:40,400
idea that if you get the vaccine, then you'll never get pregnant. Actually, it doesn't get

149
0:14:40,400 --> 0:14:44,640
the vaccinated people when I hadn't got pregnant during this short period of time. So I thought

150
0:14:44,640 --> 0:14:50,240
that was kind of interesting and reassuring. There's an interesting, and I'm going to talk

151
0:14:50,240 --> 0:14:54,880
about reactogenicity here. So let's define the word first, and then I'll get more into it. So our

152
0:14:54,880 --> 0:15:02,880
words for today are going to be reactogenicity, anaphylactic, and anaphylactoid. So reactogenicity

153
0:15:02,880 --> 0:15:08,800
is basically the evidence you get that your immune system is responding to the vaccine. So that

154
0:15:08,800 --> 0:15:13,840
might be local redness, soreness at the site of injection. That might be that feeling kind of

155
0:15:13,840 --> 0:15:19,360
a little crummy. And if our listeners have gotten a shingle shot, this seems to be a very similar

156
0:15:19,360 --> 0:15:24,960
experience. One of the concerns that people had is, Oh my gosh, if I get the vaccine,

157
0:15:24,960 --> 0:15:29,280
I'll be out of work for two days. I don't think we're seeing that. That's not what we're seeing,

158
0:15:29,280 --> 0:15:33,120
but it'll be great to have personal experience where we can talk to people who've gotten it and

159
0:15:33,120 --> 0:15:37,280
actually say, you know, Francis, Dr. Griffin, were you laying on your back for two days? Because I

160
0:15:37,280 --> 0:15:43,040
have a very low discomfort tolerance. There was sort of the interesting, you know, several young

161
0:15:43,040 --> 0:15:48,560
men were claiming that they got such bad chills from the ultra cold vaccine, that they were shaking

162
0:15:48,560 --> 0:15:52,880
so hard that their teeth were shattering and cracking their teeth. I tried to explain that

163
0:15:52,880 --> 0:15:56,880
the vaccine is brought up to room temperature before you get it. So that seems entertaining

164
0:15:56,880 --> 0:16:02,640
more than anything. But the other, and this has come up anaphylactic versus anaphylactoid.

165
0:16:03,280 --> 0:16:08,240
And so I immediately got a call yesterday morning from one of the allergists in our area.

166
0:16:09,360 --> 0:16:14,640
And there was a concern, a couple of the people in the UK who got the vaccine had allergic reactions,

167
0:16:14,640 --> 0:16:20,560
right? And the difference here is between anaphylactic and anaphylactoid. So anaphylactic

168
0:16:20,560 --> 0:16:26,800
is when you have antibodies, you get something, it triggers this severe reaction. Anaphylactoid

169
0:16:26,800 --> 0:16:31,280
is more along the lines of what was being described, something where they got Benadryl.

170
0:16:31,280 --> 0:16:37,200
It was a non-immunoglobulin mediated allergic reaction. There's discussion that here in the

171
0:16:37,200 --> 0:16:43,520
states, if someone has a history of issues like that, we might suggest taking Benadryl before the

172
0:16:43,520 --> 0:16:48,080
vaccine. And the way I was talking about that, should there be some kind of qualification

173
0:16:48,800 --> 0:16:53,920
about people that have a history of anaphylactoid allergic reactions to things,

174
0:16:55,200 --> 0:17:02,640
maybe just sort of alerting people. So I will move forward from there to what is really on the top

175
0:17:02,640 --> 0:17:06,160
of people's mind, actually, I have to say. I know in the media, they're talking a lot about

176
0:17:06,160 --> 0:17:12,240
vaccine hesitancy. But at this point, we're in the less vaccine relative to demand.

177
0:17:12,240 --> 0:17:17,760
Some point will be into some other concerns. And this is an area where now we're talking about

178
0:17:17,760 --> 0:17:23,120
equitable distribution. And so who gets the vaccine first? And the world is watching, right? So we

179
0:17:23,120 --> 0:17:29,120
want to make sure we do this the right way. So I'm going to talk specifically about New York

180
0:17:29,120 --> 0:17:35,520
States vaccination program, because the way it works, right, is the ultimate decisions are going

181
0:17:35,520 --> 0:17:40,720
to be based at the New York State Department of Health. And we've been getting updates on this.

182
0:17:40,720 --> 0:17:47,520
So high-risk healthcare workers, nursing home residents, and staff will be the first New Yorkers

183
0:17:47,520 --> 0:17:52,960
to receive the vaccine. So what does that mean? So what are high-risk hospital workers? Not everyone

184
0:17:52,960 --> 0:17:58,480
in the hospital is at the same risk. Emergency room workers, right? Particularly, we'll say

185
0:17:58,480 --> 0:18:03,440
nurses, non-physicians, right? I think they spend a lot more time. I think anyone has ever interacted

186
0:18:03,440 --> 0:18:06,800
with the healthcare profession. Your nurse spends a lot more time with you than the doctor.

187
0:18:06,800 --> 0:18:15,040
So the nurses, the doctors, all the support staff, similar ICU. So all the ICU staff,

188
0:18:15,600 --> 0:18:21,600
nurses, all the assistants, the pulmonary department staff, and New York State expects

189
0:18:21,600 --> 0:18:27,040
all high-risk hospital staff. We'll get the vaccine actually within the next week or two,

190
0:18:27,040 --> 0:18:32,560
right? So we're expecting to get vaccine here in New York next week, if this, well, when the EU

191
0:18:32,560 --> 0:18:38,000
goes through, which we all expect. And then it's going to follow, right? It's going to go very

192
0:18:38,000 --> 0:18:45,120
quickly to the long-term and congregative care staff and the residents there. And it's going

193
0:18:45,120 --> 0:18:50,800
to be interesting, who's giving the vaccine to whom? So the big pharmacy chains have stepped up

194
0:18:50,800 --> 0:18:57,920
across the nation. So CVS, Walgreens, I realize correction, Dwayne Reed is the drugstore, Dwayne

195
0:18:57,920 --> 0:19:04,720
Johnson is the rock, but throw that in there. And then it's going to move out to other physicians,

196
0:19:04,720 --> 0:19:08,800
other staff working in the hospital, and then it'll move out to essential workers, general

197
0:19:08,800 --> 0:19:14,000
population, et cetera. But this is an interesting, I'm going to tell another little story here

198
0:19:14,000 --> 0:19:20,880
about who gets first. So I was having a conversation earlier this week with the majority leader of

199
0:19:20,880 --> 0:19:28,960
one of the legislative bodies here in our great country. It was not Nancy Pelosi. And this gentleman

200
0:19:28,960 --> 0:19:33,680
was saying to me, well, you know, Dr. Griffith, it's obviously a no-brainer that we got to get

201
0:19:33,680 --> 0:19:38,640
these vaccines to the hospitals. Because, you know, when you get COVID-19, that's where people go.

202
0:19:39,520 --> 0:19:44,400
And he told me a story about how a secret service individual, you know, was talking,

203
0:19:44,400 --> 0:19:48,080
there's a couple of aspects that I think they're really interesting to our listeners. One is

204
0:19:48,080 --> 0:19:52,400
saying, you know, the secret service person, you know, where in the gloves, where in the mask,

205
0:19:52,400 --> 0:19:58,240
he's very safe at work. So it isn't that we're thinking that it's a risk for the hospital workers

206
0:19:58,240 --> 0:20:03,920
being in the hospital, though I think it is. What happened in this case was this individual's

207
0:20:03,920 --> 0:20:09,680
child got infected, the wife got infected, he got infected. And now a critical person

208
0:20:10,480 --> 0:20:14,480
is sick and going to the hospital. So we had a little bit of a discussion. I was actually

209
0:20:14,480 --> 0:20:19,760
surprised. I think our listeners know this, but I pointed out that the majority of people who get

210
0:20:19,760 --> 0:20:25,680
COVID never actually go to the hospital, that 80, 85% of people we care for in the community.

211
0:20:25,680 --> 0:20:30,800
So raising the issue that as we look at the critical people that we need to make sure we

212
0:20:30,800 --> 0:20:35,040
keep them healthy and protected, we've got to be looking at our primary care docs.

213
0:20:35,040 --> 0:20:38,720
We've got to be looking at the people that work in the urgent care centers.

214
0:20:38,720 --> 0:20:42,400
And not just the doctors, right? Think about the receptionist who's working there at the

215
0:20:42,400 --> 0:20:47,520
urgent care or the busy primary care practice. Think about the nurses, the medical assistants.

216
0:20:48,320 --> 0:20:52,800
Basically saying if we don't protect those people, if we can't keep them healthy enough to take

217
0:20:52,800 --> 0:20:58,480
care of that 80% that we manage in the outpatient setting, and we leave them with just the ER as a

218
0:20:58,480 --> 0:21:03,200
place to get care, we're going to drown. So it's a very interesting conversation as we go forward,

219
0:21:03,200 --> 0:21:10,240
we'll hear more about how this all works. And I'll be talking more about our, we'll say our

220
0:21:10,240 --> 0:21:18,640
pro-health riverside tri-state vaccine initiative. But once we get past these easy to vaccinate

221
0:21:18,640 --> 0:21:23,440
people, I think, people working in the hospitals, urgent cares, medical practices, long-term care

222
0:21:23,440 --> 0:21:28,720
facilities, I say easy. More challenging is we going out to the communities, right?

223
0:21:29,680 --> 0:21:35,840
When we move from phase one, right, to these high-risk individuals, when we start moving to

224
0:21:35,840 --> 0:21:42,640
people that are 65 and older, when we start moving to teachers, critical workers, so police,

225
0:21:42,640 --> 0:21:48,480
firefighters, et cetera, you'll be hearing more about a lot of organizations like ours are jumping

226
0:21:48,480 --> 0:21:53,120
in, reaching out to the state saying, we'll be a solution. We'll produce high-throughput

227
0:21:53,840 --> 0:21:59,040
vaccination access sites where people can do drive through like we did back with the H1

228
0:21:59,040 --> 0:22:04,000
and N1 vaccinations. Let's get as many people vaccinated and protected so we can move forward.

229
0:22:04,000 --> 0:22:10,720
All right. Now let's move. I'm going to skip a little bit past that incubation period.

230
0:22:11,680 --> 0:22:17,280
Actually, I won't skip so much. The CDC updated things where they basically said once you've

231
0:22:17,280 --> 0:22:23,840
been exposed at day seven, if you've got a negative test within 48 hours, you can end that quarantine

232
0:22:23,840 --> 0:22:29,680
a little bit earlier. We haven't quite embraced that in New York City or New York State, so

233
0:22:29,680 --> 0:22:34,000
we're still stretching out the full thing, or at least we're recommending. No one's listening.

234
0:22:34,000 --> 0:22:39,600
We're aware of that. But once you actually go ahead and actually get detectable virus, what do you

235
0:22:39,600 --> 0:22:45,520
do? Or what do you do if you think that's the case? And the NIH has a nice page now really

236
0:22:45,520 --> 0:22:51,760
basically pointing out that testing saves lives. So when I was talking about how we're going to roll

237
0:22:51,760 --> 0:22:56,640
out the vaccines, I was talking to a lot of our urgent cares. Some of our urgent care centers

238
0:22:56,640 --> 0:23:02,720
are doing over 6,000 COVID tests a day per site. I mean, this is really amazing.

239
0:23:03,440 --> 0:23:07,680
And if you look at our positivity rate being five or six percent, I'm going to do five percent.

240
0:23:07,680 --> 0:23:13,760
The math is easier. You're talking about 300 people testing positive at one of these sites,

241
0:23:13,760 --> 0:23:18,480
each of these sites per day. This was huge when we went into Thanksgiving.

242
0:23:18,480 --> 0:23:23,840
All of those people testing positive being pulled out and not going to that Thanksgiving dinner.

243
0:23:23,840 --> 0:23:27,680
Think of all the contagion that you're stopping by identifying people who are positive.

244
0:23:28,400 --> 0:23:33,520
So this is really critical. And there's really a push. Now, don't just get tested when you have

245
0:23:33,520 --> 0:23:39,920
symptoms. Testing saves lives. It identifies the spread before it happens. And this is really

246
0:23:39,920 --> 0:23:44,960
critical in being embraced. And actually, a lot of people, I think it's taken a little bit longer

247
0:23:44,960 --> 0:23:51,200
than it needed to, but embracing rapid resulting. So what are we doing? This is sort of a four doctors.

248
0:23:51,200 --> 0:23:57,280
We're doing rapid antigen testing at most of our sites. We do Abbott ID now at some of them as well.

249
0:23:57,280 --> 0:24:04,640
We often send off a PCR as well. What sometimes happens, right? 6,000 tests. You don't tell everyone

250
0:24:04,640 --> 0:24:10,960
to sort of quarantine while you're waiting for that PCR. But some of the time that antigen test

251
0:24:10,960 --> 0:24:16,320
is coming back negative, but the PCR is coming back positive. We're catching some people in that

252
0:24:16,320 --> 0:24:21,840
ramp up phase. We're catching some people sort of after the fact in the ramp down phase.

253
0:24:22,800 --> 0:24:29,360
But what we're doing then is basically calling them up. Your PCR came back positive and then

254
0:24:29,360 --> 0:24:34,160
sort of moving forward with that. So that's going to happen. When you're doing 6,000 tests per site

255
0:24:34,160 --> 0:24:39,520
per day, a certain number of those negative antigen tests are going to be people that are early

256
0:24:39,520 --> 0:24:45,280
enough in disease that you're getting a few hours before that antigen test term is positive.

257
0:24:45,280 --> 0:24:53,280
So the early inflammatory phase. This I touched on a little bit above and just to reiterate,

258
0:24:53,280 --> 0:24:58,880
it was actually interesting when I was talking to the majority leader. He was shocked when I said

259
0:24:58,880 --> 0:25:02,720
that 80% of people are managed outside the hospital. They actually challenged me. Where did you come

260
0:25:02,720 --> 0:25:07,600
up with that number? I was a little surprised, actually. But I think that as someone told me,

261
0:25:07,600 --> 0:25:14,160
well, 80% of the focus has been on the hospitals. People are not aware of all the people out there.

262
0:25:14,160 --> 0:25:22,160
When you look at 240,000 people in a single day being diagnosed with COVID,

263
0:25:22,160 --> 0:25:26,480
they're not all going to the hospital. If anything, we're getting above that 80%. We're getting

264
0:25:26,480 --> 0:25:31,120
better and better at managing these people outside the hospital. So what are we doing?

265
0:25:32,000 --> 0:25:37,120
We're still recommending the first week, just symptomatic management. We've eased up. You can

266
0:25:37,120 --> 0:25:43,440
take your leave, your ibuprofen, your Tylenol to treat those viral symptoms. We are encouraging

267
0:25:43,440 --> 0:25:49,200
people to wait until the second week to consider steroids. We're limiting steroids to people who

268
0:25:49,200 --> 0:25:54,560
have issues with their oxygen level dropping. Actually here in New York, we're setting people

269
0:25:54,560 --> 0:26:02,480
home with post-oximeters, 15, $20. That's a good way for us to then manage them. Just speaking to

270
0:26:02,480 --> 0:26:07,760
a physician friend of mine who's in that second week where each day we're checking in to see where

271
0:26:07,760 --> 0:26:12,640
his post-ox is. It's in the high 90s still. As long as it stays in the high 90s, he'll continue

272
0:26:12,640 --> 0:26:18,560
to take his aspirin a day, try to stay active, stay off the steroids, stay off the antibiotics,

273
0:26:19,360 --> 0:26:24,400
and just manage them outside the hospital. This is critical because you can't send everyone with

274
0:26:24,400 --> 0:26:30,880
COVID and a fever to the ERs. You can overwhelm the system and when you do that, no one benefits.

275
0:26:32,320 --> 0:26:39,040
We did see the formal, peer-reviewed publication of the repurposed antiviral drugs for COVID-19

276
0:26:39,040 --> 0:26:45,200
interim, WHO, solitary trial results that came out in the New England Journal on the second.

277
0:26:45,920 --> 0:26:52,320
Again, this is where they looked at remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, lopinovir, interferon regimens,

278
0:26:53,920 --> 0:27:00,640
and really did not show any overwhelming compelling evidence for mortality,

279
0:27:00,640 --> 0:27:05,840
initiation of ventilation, duration of hospital stay. This is an interesting issue because the

280
0:27:05,840 --> 0:27:11,600
first of those in there was remdesivir, right? A lot of the hospital systems have purchased

281
0:27:11,600 --> 0:27:16,720
large orders of remdesivir here in the United States. I'm actually seeing people get admitted

282
0:27:16,720 --> 0:27:21,920
just for remdesivir, even though they're not hypoxic. I think this is a decision people have

283
0:27:21,920 --> 0:27:28,160
to make. Is the benefit of remdesivir enough that it's worth hospitalizing someone just for that

284
0:27:28,160 --> 0:27:34,240
therapy? Because originally, the idea is it shortened your hospital stay. Here, I have people

285
0:27:34,240 --> 0:27:40,400
getting admitted to the hospital without hypoxia just to get the remdesivir. Here, it's creating a

286
0:27:40,400 --> 0:27:45,200
five-day hospital stay versus shortening a hospital stay. Something to think about there.

287
0:27:45,760 --> 0:27:51,440
We continue to see secondary infections later on. The multi-inflammatory phase,

288
0:27:51,440 --> 0:27:57,600
I think I mentioned last time the individual with the Guian Barre. We gave them the intravenous

289
0:27:57,600 --> 0:28:03,040
immunoglobulin. A few days later, he's squeezing my hands, but then he actually started to get

290
0:28:03,040 --> 0:28:08,240
flasset again. This continues to be a challenge. I have another gentleman. I'm not sure the

291
0:28:08,240 --> 0:28:14,160
connection here, but he was a gentleman who had COVID and then at about week four developed an

292
0:28:14,160 --> 0:28:20,400
expressive aphasia. Really unclear what that is, but the timing is concerning for a connection there.

293
0:28:21,360 --> 0:28:28,720
A number of papers out there, case reports, suggested a connection. What is expressive aphasia?

294
0:28:28,720 --> 0:28:34,560
This is a gentleman where I ask him questions. I go for a while until finally I hit an area,

295
0:28:34,560 --> 0:28:40,000
and he just can't get the words out. He can't tell me. I'll ask him where he works,

296
0:28:40,560 --> 0:28:45,440
and it comes out gibberish. If I let him just talk on his own, he could talk. It sounds like he's

297
0:28:45,440 --> 0:28:52,480
fine. Then I say, you work at GBP. What does GBP stand for? When he tries to say GBP, it just comes

298
0:28:52,480 --> 0:28:58,320
out. I ask him, do you know what GBP stands for? He nods. He knows what. He just can't get it

299
0:28:58,320 --> 0:29:05,680
expressed. Really a challenge. I'm going to sort of wrap out here with our tail phase,

300
0:29:05,680 --> 0:29:10,240
but in the tail phase, I want to talk a little bit about challenges we're having with DC planning

301
0:29:10,240 --> 0:29:18,320
now. The tail phase is very recognized, continues to be a huge problem. Actually, one of the questions

302
0:29:18,320 --> 0:29:23,120
I just got from this physician colleague was his wife, his son. They're both sick. They're an

303
0:29:23,120 --> 0:29:28,640
urgent care waiting to get tested. Should he wait? Should they bother getting that test? My advice

304
0:29:28,640 --> 0:29:34,480
was yes, get that test. We need that objective evidence. But one of the issues that came up

305
0:29:34,480 --> 0:29:41,280
is currently COVID is considered an acute diagnosis, not a chronic. One of the nurses that I've talked

306
0:29:41,280 --> 0:29:47,120
about several times is having issues getting disability coverage because they say COVID is an

307
0:29:47,120 --> 0:29:52,800
acute diagnosis. You had that back in March, April. It's not a chronic disease. If you're going to

308
0:29:52,800 --> 0:29:58,480
look for any kind of support, you need a chronic diagnosis. It's interesting. This has also become

309
0:29:58,480 --> 0:30:03,680
an issue for oxygen. We have a number of individuals in the hospital. We're looking at trying to

310
0:30:03,680 --> 0:30:09,840
discharge them, but oxygen is only paid for if you have a chronic condition requiring oxygen.

311
0:30:10,480 --> 0:30:15,120
Back in March, April, the early days of the pandemic, the governor stepped in. Executive

312
0:30:15,120 --> 0:30:22,240
orders basically said everyone has to cover and supply oxygen for COVID. Interesting that we're

313
0:30:22,240 --> 0:30:29,440
seeing bureaucracy stand in the way of what we recommend as good care. I think the governor listens

314
0:30:29,440 --> 0:30:36,160
to us, Vincent, so he can maybe jump in and give us some help on that. But before we take emails,

315
0:30:36,160 --> 0:30:41,360
let me just say we're continuing to our support of the Peace Corps, HIV and AIDS programs.

316
0:30:41,360 --> 0:30:46,240
Just to point out, we are in the midst of this pandemic. I hope when we get through

317
0:30:46,240 --> 0:30:51,280
the other side, people don't forget about COVID-19 so that we don't go into this unprepared like we

318
0:30:51,280 --> 0:30:56,800
did this time. But there's still a huge pandemic going on. We have not really gotten through the

319
0:30:56,800 --> 0:31:03,440
HIV pandemic. And so go to parasiteswithoutborders.com, help us support them, but also help us continue

320
0:31:03,440 --> 0:31:09,360
our mission. Daniel, have you seen an uptick in influenza cases yet this season?

321
0:31:09,360 --> 0:31:17,600
So there are more influenza cases. There is an increase, but it is actually a much lower

322
0:31:17,600 --> 0:31:23,680
percent of cases, a slower number of cases of influenza this season than we previously. Usually

323
0:31:23,680 --> 0:31:28,880
now is when we start seeing all these flu admissions. But I think all the things we're doing is keeping

324
0:31:28,880 --> 0:31:34,240
flu at a lower level. That's great. That's good. This one maybe one silver lining, right?

325
0:31:34,240 --> 0:31:41,280
Yes. All right, we have some email. Remember everybody you can send an email to Daniel at

326
0:31:41,280 --> 0:31:48,400
microbe.tv. And we've got a lot, but we'll just do a couple here today. This is from Sean. I'm an

327
0:31:48,400 --> 0:31:55,200
orthopedic surgeon in New Orleans and have a friend who's an internist who treats COVID patients.

328
0:31:57,840 --> 0:32:00,960
Yeah, I'm not sure that's what he's supposed to be doing, right? But

329
0:32:00,960 --> 0:32:07,040
he's on regular zoom call clinical updates. He told me that dexamethasone is no longer

330
0:32:07,040 --> 0:32:11,440
recommended to treat COVID. This seems to contradict everything I've learned so far about how dex

331
0:32:11,440 --> 0:32:16,080
is one of the best therapeutics we have. What do you think? Well, I think it's his friend,

332
0:32:16,080 --> 0:32:21,040
the internist who's taking care of the people. So that's good. That's what we want. As I mentioned,

333
0:32:21,040 --> 0:32:26,640
80%, 85%, the majority of people with COVID do not need an infectious disease specialist.

334
0:32:26,640 --> 0:32:30,480
They don't need to go to the hospital. This is something everyone should feel comfortable

335
0:32:30,480 --> 0:32:36,320
managing the outpatient setting in most cases. We usually, as I point out, we don't give dexameth

336
0:32:36,320 --> 0:32:40,800
zone to everyone. It isn't like connect the dots. It isn't COVID dexamethasone.

337
0:32:40,800 --> 0:32:46,080
dexamethasone is reserved for the class for which it was shown to make a difference.

338
0:32:46,080 --> 0:32:49,840
And these are people who are starting to develop the early inflammatory response.

339
0:32:49,840 --> 0:32:56,000
It's during the second week. And it's people who are starting to get hypoxic, right? So if you're

340
0:32:56,000 --> 0:33:00,880
not hypoxic, if your sats are still in the 90s and you're doing well in the outpatient setting,

341
0:33:01,600 --> 0:33:05,440
or even it's the first week, don't give them steroids. Steroids is something that we should be

342
0:33:05,440 --> 0:33:12,160
giving to only a select number of individuals. Is the mortality benefit huge? No, the absolute

343
0:33:12,160 --> 0:33:16,720
benefit is only a couple percent in people with low oxygen requirement, a little bit higher in

344
0:33:16,720 --> 0:33:24,240
people who are more serious disease. But yeah, it's not for everyone. There's a certain place for it.

345
0:33:24,240 --> 0:33:33,840
Okay, we have an email from anonymous in Manchester, UK, who is worried about their dad in Australia.

346
0:33:34,560 --> 0:33:39,520
Her dad had a flu vaccine 30 years ago and developed Guillain-Barre syndrome.

347
0:33:40,640 --> 0:33:46,880
So anonymous wants to know, is there a reason my dad or anyone like him to worry about any of the

348
0:33:46,880 --> 0:33:54,320
COVID-19 vaccines or candidates, no longer gets flu shots? And should I worry since I am, you know,

349
0:33:54,320 --> 0:34:02,800
that's my father. You know, so this has come up quite a bit. And you know, questions about

350
0:34:02,800 --> 0:34:09,280
the vaccine, should I worry about Guillain-Barre? And actually, I think the flu is a perfect example.

351
0:34:09,280 --> 0:34:14,640
We look at people who get natural infection with influenza versus people who get the influenza

352
0:34:14,640 --> 0:34:19,200
vaccine and the incidence of Guillain-Barre is certainly higher with getting natural infection

353
0:34:19,200 --> 0:34:24,080
from influenza. So sort of an interesting thing in a perfect world, there's no influenza, there's

354
0:34:24,080 --> 0:34:30,560
no influenza shot and there's less Guillain-Barre. But yeah, I've certainly seen it in natural

355
0:34:30,560 --> 0:34:35,280
infection with influenza, I've also seen it after a flu shot. But is this going to be an issue for

356
0:34:35,280 --> 0:34:42,320
people who get the different vaccines for COVID? So far, we're not seeing a signal. Pretty soon,

357
0:34:42,320 --> 0:34:47,760
we're going to be having millions of people vaccinated. So by the time, you know, it rolls

358
0:34:47,760 --> 0:34:51,040
out to other individuals, I think there's going to be more data to help us with this.

359
0:34:52,880 --> 0:34:57,280
The next emails from a nurse in a New York City hospital who's been trying to get pregnant for

360
0:34:57,280 --> 0:35:04,400
some months and wonders if she should wait until after vaccination, because the vaccines, I think,

361
0:35:04,400 --> 0:35:07,520
are not being tested in pregnant women. What do you think, Dan?

362
0:35:07,520 --> 0:35:12,640
Yeah, no, I think that's, yeah, no, excellent. I'm going to say, you know, interfere with your

363
0:35:12,640 --> 0:35:17,680
family planning decisions here. Tell your husband to curse me if he wants to have a child immediately.

364
0:35:18,240 --> 0:35:24,720
But as we saw, they excluded pregnant women in the vaccine trials as a nurse in a New York City

365
0:35:24,720 --> 0:35:32,240
hospital. You're right here in phase 1A, potentially going to get vaccinated in the next few weeks,

366
0:35:32,240 --> 0:35:36,640
right? And after the 10 days, you'll have some protection. Three weeks later, you get your second

367
0:35:36,640 --> 0:35:41,920
dose and then you're good to go. We certainly saw people go ahead and get pregnant once they

368
0:35:41,920 --> 0:35:46,240
had been vaccinated. I think I mentioned there were a dozen women that went ahead and did that

369
0:35:46,240 --> 0:35:51,840
in the Pfizer trial. So yeah, just, you know, wait, wait a few weeks, you know, and then go ahead.

370
0:35:51,840 --> 0:35:59,120
That would make sense. You hate to go ahead and, you know, not get vaccinated, you know, when you

371
0:35:59,120 --> 0:36:03,440
could be really mad or just postponing that pregnancy by a few weeks. So that's my advice,

372
0:36:03,440 --> 0:36:06,560
but I'm going to leave the ultimate decision up to you and your partner.

373
0:36:07,760 --> 0:36:12,720
All right, we have the last two are the same question. We have a question from

374
0:36:12,720 --> 0:36:19,440
the FISA and Katherine, whether immune compromised people can be vaccinated.

375
0:36:21,120 --> 0:36:25,520
So that's an excellent question. So a lot of people are asking about this. And, you know,

376
0:36:25,520 --> 0:36:31,440
there's a certain sophistication to mRNA vaccines and concerns about people with autoimmune diseases.

377
0:36:31,440 --> 0:36:37,440
And when you make the RNA vaccines, right, you're basically taking DNA, you're going over to RNA,

378
0:36:37,440 --> 0:36:42,880
and some of the products will be double stranded RNA. So they're early vaccines or the early trials

379
0:36:42,880 --> 0:36:46,480
when they're going through this, they've realized that you were making contaminants of double

380
0:36:46,480 --> 0:36:50,160
stranded DNA. And you really don't want that, right? That's potentially something we worry

381
0:36:50,160 --> 0:36:56,320
could trigger autoimmunity. So they do a really careful chromatography process. They purify and

382
0:36:56,320 --> 0:37:02,880
make sure it's just straight RNA. At least what we're seeing so far, I think it looks like it's

383
0:37:02,880 --> 0:37:08,640
going to be okay to use in these individuals. It is not a live vaccine. That's good. It has sort

384
0:37:08,640 --> 0:37:16,080
of less stuff in there. So we're anticipating that this might be a safer approach. And I throw

385
0:37:16,080 --> 0:37:20,640
that in. Not only am I, at this point, saying like the RNA vaccines, but we have a couple other

386
0:37:20,640 --> 0:37:26,800
vaccines on the horizon, the Chinese with their inactivated, Sino farm. That's one that was what,

387
0:37:26,800 --> 0:37:32,800
86% efficacy, they tell us, we'll see the actual data on that. We've got Johnson and Johnson coming

388
0:37:32,800 --> 0:37:38,560
out either this month or January, actually, so much COVID in the States, Jay and Jay said they

389
0:37:38,560 --> 0:37:44,480
don't have to have 60,000 people. Looks like they'll probably stop at 40,000, just this so much COVID.

390
0:37:44,480 --> 0:37:48,960
And then we'll see even more. But yeah, as we go forward, we're not expecting there to be a problem

391
0:37:48,960 --> 0:37:54,720
here. We like the idea that it's not a, should I say live vaccine, I'll say active replicating

392
0:37:54,720 --> 0:37:59,200
virus that we're injecting people. This is really just that sticky note with instructions for how

393
0:37:59,200 --> 0:38:03,840
your immune system should respond. And we are thinking and the data seems to be supporting that

394
0:38:03,840 --> 0:38:09,200
this will be a safer technology. So right now, if you're say one of these first-line people who

395
0:38:09,200 --> 0:38:13,520
are going to be vaccinated next week, and you have an immune compromise, are they going to give it

396
0:38:13,520 --> 0:38:21,200
to you or no? It'll be on a case by case basis. Okay, there's no general rule. Very good. All right,

397
0:38:21,200 --> 0:38:30,320
that's our 40th from weekly COVID-19 clinical update with Dr. Daniel Griffin. Thanks again, Daniel.

398
0:38:30,320 --> 0:38:44,160
Oh, thank you so much. Everyone be safe.
