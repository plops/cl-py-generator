0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:06,880
This week in virology, the podcast about viruses, the kind that make you sick.

2
0:00:10,400 --> 0:00:20,640
From Microbe TV, this is Twiv, this week in virology, episode 752 recorded on May 6th, 2021.

3
0:00:21,280 --> 0:00:27,200
I'm Vincent Draconiello, and you're listening to the podcast All About Viruses. Joining me

4
0:00:27,200 --> 0:00:35,440
today from New York, Daniel Griffin. Hello, everyone. This is clinical update number 61, Daniel,

5
0:00:35,440 --> 0:00:41,600
and I am going to paraphrase former New York mayor Ed Koch. How are we doing?

6
0:00:44,000 --> 0:00:50,320
You know, I actually, I knew Ed Koch quite well. My father actually worked for Ed Koch, so he would

7
0:00:50,320 --> 0:00:54,160
often, you know, the mornings would often start with Ed Koch swinging by the apartment.

8
0:00:54,160 --> 0:01:00,160
And so, yeah, he was quite a guy. He was a bit of a character. And we will get right into the

9
0:01:00,160 --> 0:01:07,680
update on how things are, but let me start with my quotation. Three things shine before the world

10
0:01:07,680 --> 0:01:14,640
and cannot be hidden. They are the moon, the sun, and the truth. And now this is a modernization

11
0:01:14,640 --> 0:01:19,760
of a saying attributed to the Buddha. And I think the eyes of the world are on India right now,

12
0:01:19,760 --> 0:01:27,200
and it's painful to so quickly see that Hegel was correct. And the one thing we learned from

13
0:01:27,200 --> 0:01:32,800
history, right, is that we do not learn from history. This is recent history, and so many of

14
0:01:32,800 --> 0:01:39,200
the same mistakes are being made there. So many resources are being ported to unproven therapies,

15
0:01:40,000 --> 0:01:47,840
shortages of things that do really make a difference, vaccines, oxygen, no significant access if any

16
0:01:47,840 --> 0:01:54,960
at all to monoclonal therapy and use of failed non-pharmaceutical interventions. And we're going

17
0:01:54,960 --> 0:02:00,640
to talk a little bit about what is a non-pharmaceutical intervention? What is an NPI? But let me start

18
0:02:00,640 --> 0:02:07,520
with an update a little bit here in the US, and then we will make sure we keep mentioning what's

19
0:02:07,520 --> 0:02:12,400
going on in the world, because it's quite different. One of the first things I've noticed is that the

20
0:02:12,400 --> 0:02:18,000
paywalls are starting to go back up. So some of these articles that I don't know if you've noticed

21
0:02:18,000 --> 0:02:21,680
that as well, but some of these articles I wanted to read, I had to go through the Columbia

22
0:02:22,560 --> 0:02:28,560
access to get the article. So I think that's unfortunate. I think people were getting used to

23
0:02:28,560 --> 0:02:32,560
the ability to access information. I think it's critical. Maybe we should start trying to think

24
0:02:32,560 --> 0:02:39,440
about ways to keep those paywalls down, create other ways where people can get access to information.

25
0:02:39,440 --> 0:02:45,040
When you publish something, you can pay a â€“ and it is â€“ a hefty sum to create an open access,

26
0:02:45,040 --> 0:02:52,720
but we need other ways to do that. So a little bit of a change there. We are seeing a dramatic

27
0:02:52,720 --> 0:02:58,880
drop in numbers of cases here in the New York area and actually across the country. I'll get

28
0:02:58,880 --> 0:03:03,280
into this in a little bit later as we talk about modeling. And the prediction that I think we're

29
0:03:03,280 --> 0:03:09,200
on course for an incredibly low number of cases come this July. The rest of the world,

30
0:03:09,200 --> 0:03:14,640
if you look at it, they're on the other trajectory. I think they're going to start thinking of that

31
0:03:14,640 --> 0:03:20,720
first what people call the wave as nothing more than a swell before the true wave started to spread

32
0:03:20,720 --> 0:03:26,400
around the world. And this is tragic. But let's hit each section. So we've got a lot to cover

33
0:03:26,400 --> 0:03:31,600
today. Children and COVID, I'm going to return to this in our vaccination section. I talked a

34
0:03:31,600 --> 0:03:37,840
little bit last time about the CDC camp guidance. And oh my, the CDC is getting raked over the

35
0:03:37,840 --> 0:03:45,120
coals on that. This episode drops on Saturday, but I'm going to be on the Brian Lair show on Friday

36
0:03:45,120 --> 0:03:50,080
here on NPR that'll probably be recorded. We'll see how well I feel the questions and criticisms

37
0:03:50,080 --> 0:03:56,240
of the guidance live on the year. But then I'm also going to be talking on Tuesday of next week

38
0:03:56,240 --> 0:04:03,120
on TV about what we are hoping the day. I'm going to predict the future again here. So next Tuesday

39
0:04:03,120 --> 0:04:09,680
we think that the EUA will expand for Pfizer down to 12 year old. And we'll discuss a little bit

40
0:04:09,680 --> 0:04:15,440
about what that means. So let's go right into pre-exposure period transmission. And I think this

41
0:04:15,440 --> 0:04:20,640
gets back to our initial quotation. We have learned a significant amount regarding transmission. And

42
0:04:20,640 --> 0:04:26,880
this is honestly no longer an area clouded in mystery or really just upward debate. We have science

43
0:04:26,880 --> 0:04:34,400
here, not just opinion. And to just quote the CDC and the WHO is in the same line with this.

44
0:04:34,400 --> 0:04:41,600
COVID-19 mostly most commonly spreads during close contact. COVID-19 can sometimes be spread

45
0:04:41,600 --> 0:04:48,800
by airborne transmission. COVID-19 spreads less commonly through contact with contaminated surfaces.

46
0:04:48,800 --> 0:04:56,640
So in the MMWR there was an article modeling of future COVID-19 cases, hospitalization and deaths

47
0:04:56,640 --> 0:05:03,360
by vaccination rates, and non-pharmaceutical intervention scenarios United States April through

48
0:05:03,360 --> 0:05:10,800
September 2021. And this article is doing what Yogi Barrett told us was the hardest thing to do,

49
0:05:10,800 --> 0:05:15,280
what is the hardest thing to predict the future. And that's actually what they were doing here.

50
0:05:15,280 --> 0:05:22,800
The authors presented predictive models of numbers of cases, hospitalizations and deaths per week

51
0:05:23,680 --> 0:05:29,600
based upon different vaccination rates. So either a high or a low vaccination rate and

52
0:05:29,600 --> 0:05:37,760
different non-pharmaceutical intervention levels or what they call NPIs. So NPIs are things like

53
0:05:37,760 --> 0:05:42,640
wearing masks, physical distancing. I like that they're not saying social but physical distancing.

54
0:05:42,640 --> 0:05:50,000
And this was just released May 5th, but these models started their predictions March 27th.

55
0:05:50,000 --> 0:05:55,760
You actually got to see a little bit like how have they been doing since the models fired up.

56
0:05:56,640 --> 0:06:04,400
And they had numbers dropping from the peak in January to a nadir in April. And then a bit of

57
0:06:04,400 --> 0:06:12,400
a rise into May followed by a rather rapid decline to very low levels by July. There were some

58
0:06:12,400 --> 0:06:17,920
error bars in these predictions. And there were really sort of four scenario lines that you could

59
0:06:17,920 --> 0:06:24,640
follow. So you could either have low or high vaccination rates coupled with low or moderate

60
0:06:25,280 --> 0:06:30,880
NPIs, non-pharmaceutical interventions. And yet each of those four scenarios low, low, low,

61
0:06:30,880 --> 0:06:37,280
high, high, low, high. And if anything, I have to say the future has turned out to be even better

62
0:06:37,280 --> 0:06:42,560
here in the US than they predicted. If you look at the daily deaths, this has been decreasing

63
0:06:42,560 --> 0:06:48,160
since that peak in January. So I know there were some sort of, we'll call them pessimists talking

64
0:06:48,160 --> 0:06:54,080
about the spring wave. The spring wave has not really materialized. I've been describing it as

65
0:06:54,080 --> 0:07:00,320
this spring plateau. If you look at numbers across the country, certainly regional areas,

66
0:07:00,320 --> 0:07:05,360
you look at Michigan, there was a second wave in Michigan, just in terms of cases and deaths.

67
0:07:05,360 --> 0:07:10,960
But if you look across the country, we are actually experiencing, I will say, their best case scenario.

68
0:07:11,680 --> 0:07:19,040
And based upon this, we're actually looking at a really good July ahead of us, as I think a lot

69
0:07:19,040 --> 0:07:25,600
of us have been predicting for a while here. So this is the time for masks distancing outdoors

70
0:07:25,600 --> 0:07:31,360
versus indoors, limiting group sizes, all these non-pharmaceutical interventions, as we call them,

71
0:07:31,360 --> 0:07:37,360
and vaccination, both active. And one day we're hoping you get approval for passive, or I'll say

72
0:07:37,360 --> 0:07:44,000
expansion of the EUA for the use of the passive monoclonal antibodies. All right, let's move right

73
0:07:44,000 --> 0:07:49,840
into testing, never miss an opportunity to test. We're falling down a little bit, you know,

74
0:07:49,840 --> 0:07:55,760
compare our testing rates to the UK, and they are doing much better. They are doing a lot more tests

75
0:07:55,760 --> 0:08:03,600
per population than we are. Now, for a while, we've been talking about the way different tests

76
0:08:03,600 --> 0:08:09,520
can be used to answer different questions about COVID. And a big disconnect still seems to come

77
0:08:09,520 --> 0:08:16,640
in people's understanding of the rapid antigen test versus PCR testing. So the paper performance

78
0:08:16,640 --> 0:08:23,440
evaluation of Serial SARS-CoV-2, rapid antigen testing during a nursing home outbreak,

79
0:08:23,440 --> 0:08:30,320
was recently published in the Annals of Internal Medicine. The authors reported on a prospective

80
0:08:30,320 --> 0:08:37,280
evaluation involving three facility-wide rounds of testing, where paired respiratory specimens

81
0:08:37,280 --> 0:08:44,640
were collected to evaluate the performance of the BINEX now, antigen test, compared with virus culture

82
0:08:45,200 --> 0:08:50,960
and real-time PCR. So real-time reverse transcription, polymerase chain reaction.

83
0:08:50,960 --> 0:08:58,640
Early and late infection were defined using changes in the RT-PCR cycle threshold values

84
0:08:58,640 --> 0:09:06,880
and prior test results. And they evaluated 532 paired specimens collected from 234 residents

85
0:09:06,880 --> 0:09:14,880
and staff. And the authors reported on the percentage of positive agreements, a little bit of terminology,

86
0:09:14,880 --> 0:09:24,400
the PPA, and the percentage of negative agreements, so the PNA, of the BINEX now rapid testing and

87
0:09:24,400 --> 0:09:32,880
the RT-PCR with viral culture. They're using viral culture here as really a potential infectiousness

88
0:09:32,880 --> 0:09:39,280
measure. Now, what did they find? What about sensitivity for detecting infectious level

89
0:09:39,280 --> 0:09:48,400
of SARS-CoV-2? So the BINEX now, PPA, so the percentage of positive agreement with viral culture,

90
0:09:48,400 --> 0:09:55,520
used for detection of replication, competent virus, was 95%. I think that's pretty stellar,

91
0:09:55,520 --> 0:10:02,880
right? So you're really asking the question, is this person contagious? However, the overall PPA

92
0:10:02,880 --> 0:10:10,880
with RT-PCR of antigen tests with RT-PCR was only 69%. So I think this is consistent with what

93
0:10:10,880 --> 0:10:17,600
we have been seeing, which is that PCR is perhaps overly sensitive for asking and answering the

94
0:10:17,600 --> 0:10:23,600
question of infectiousness. The RT-PCR is great late in the course for picking up those people,

95
0:10:23,600 --> 0:10:29,520
past that acute first week, who might now be in that early inflammatory phase. They might be showing

96
0:10:29,520 --> 0:10:35,120
up at the hospital. The rapid antigen test at this point may start to turn negative,

97
0:10:35,840 --> 0:10:40,480
but we're asking a different question. We're saying, is this need for oxygen

98
0:10:40,480 --> 0:10:47,280
due to an acute infection last week? And so the negative antigen tests that they did,

99
0:10:47,280 --> 0:10:53,280
where there was a negative antigen test and a positive PCR, those had a mean CT value of 33.2.

100
0:10:53,280 --> 0:10:59,760
So an RNA copy numbered down only in the thousand. So I think this really reinforces this model.

101
0:10:59,760 --> 0:11:06,640
The rapid antigen tests within 15 minutes is really good at identifying those people who are

102
0:11:06,640 --> 0:11:14,240
contagious or infectious, getting them isolated before they spread. PCR is more sensitive, but it

103
0:11:14,240 --> 0:11:23,040
asks and answers a different question. So don't think of the PCR as first class and the antigen test

104
0:11:23,040 --> 0:11:29,040
is sitting back in coach by the bathroom. The rapid antigen test is a very sensitive,

105
0:11:29,600 --> 0:11:36,160
really helpful tool for blocking spread of this virus. Active vaccination never

106
0:11:36,160 --> 0:11:42,480
miss an opportunity to vaccinate. In the US, we have shifted from arm searching for vaccines to

107
0:11:42,480 --> 0:11:47,280
vaccine searching farms. And we're definitely seeing that we need to do a little better job

108
0:11:47,280 --> 0:11:54,800
here of connecting those arms with vaccines. And now this might change for a brief time,

109
0:11:54,800 --> 0:12:00,560
because I am hoping that prior to the next wave that we record, we hear that the FDA,

110
0:12:00,560 --> 0:12:08,080
like the EU and Canada, will have expanded the Pfizer EOA down to 12 year olds. So 12, 13,

111
0:12:08,080 --> 0:12:15,280
14, 15, we're expecting they will become eligible. We're already hearing that the states are getting

112
0:12:15,280 --> 0:12:19,680
ready there. They're expecting this as well. They want to be ready so that that morning,

113
0:12:19,680 --> 0:12:24,640
it's usually six a.m. Right? We got up at six a.m. So we can say that they hear that it's

114
0:12:25,600 --> 0:12:31,040
expanded, that the states can then say, okay, we're on board with this. And all the pharmacies,

115
0:12:31,040 --> 0:12:35,360
all the state sites can be ready to get that Pfizer into people's arms. Because I have to say,

116
0:12:35,360 --> 0:12:40,960
a lot of Pfizer vaccine is sitting there. We also heard, this is exciting news, that

117
0:12:40,960 --> 0:12:46,640
buy-in tech, right? So it's the Pfizer buy-in tech vaccine. So buy-in tech has a new formulation

118
0:12:46,640 --> 0:12:53,280
that should allow them to store the vaccine for up to six months in a normal refrigerator.

119
0:12:53,280 --> 0:12:59,600
And they're preparing the data packets for FDA approval on this upgrade to the vaccine.

120
0:12:59,600 --> 0:13:05,120
And this will be a huge shift past these thermal shippers with dry ice and all those concerns.

121
0:13:05,120 --> 0:13:09,200
Now, what about when we're going to vaccinate kids? Are the kids going to want to get vaccinated?

122
0:13:09,200 --> 0:13:14,000
Are the parents going to want to vaccinate them? I was talking a little bit with Jay Burger,

123
0:13:14,640 --> 0:13:19,360
the head of Pediatrics for Pro Health New York. And I will mention also an avid

124
0:13:19,360 --> 0:13:26,320
Twiv listener about a lot of the conversations he's had with parents about why they would want

125
0:13:26,320 --> 0:13:32,720
to protect their children from COVID-19 with vaccination. And there still is this perception

126
0:13:32,720 --> 0:13:37,600
that children do not get sick with COVID, or that children do not end up in the hospital with COVID,

127
0:13:37,600 --> 0:13:42,000
or that children are not at risk for long-term impacts following a COVID infection.

128
0:13:42,560 --> 0:13:46,960
So I just wanted to take a moment here and just sort of get the numbers out here,

129
0:13:46,960 --> 0:13:51,280
because this will be a discussion, I think, a lot of physicians, actually a lot of family

130
0:13:51,280 --> 0:13:57,120
members will have with other family members. On May 2, the American Academy of Pediatrics

131
0:13:57,120 --> 0:14:03,440
reported that for the last week of April, the percentage of cases occurring in children

132
0:14:03,440 --> 0:14:14,720
had risen to 22% of the reported cases, or up to 71,649 cases in children under the age of 18,

133
0:14:14,720 --> 0:14:20,880
just in the last week of April. Now, I have to say, last year during April, children only made up

134
0:14:20,880 --> 0:14:27,440
3% of all the cases of COVID-19 in the entire country. And actually, there were less overall

135
0:14:27,440 --> 0:14:33,680
cases. So this is really a dramatic rise in the number of children that got infected that last

136
0:14:33,680 --> 0:14:37,600
week of April. This is really a dramatic rise in the number of children who are currently getting

137
0:14:37,600 --> 0:14:44,560
infected with COVID. And I have to say, kudos to the parents out there. We really did a very

138
0:14:44,560 --> 0:14:50,080
effective job early on of protecting our kids from getting COVID. This involves school closures,

139
0:14:51,200 --> 0:14:54,960
and all the other things we did. But now we're letting the kids get COVID.

140
0:14:55,760 --> 0:15:01,200
But I want to say, even doing so much to protect the kids here in the United States,

141
0:15:01,200 --> 0:15:06,720
we still had pediatric deaths. We still had hospitalizations. We still have children that

142
0:15:06,720 --> 0:15:12,560
developed long COVID, as I've previously mentioned. And this is one of those public health scenarios.

143
0:15:12,560 --> 0:15:18,880
When you do a really good job, and the outcomes are good, and I will say only a couple hundred

144
0:15:18,880 --> 0:15:23,280
children die, people say, oh, it really doesn't affect children. It must not be a big thing.

145
0:15:24,080 --> 0:15:28,480
That's the problem with a public health success, which we have had to date for children.

146
0:15:29,440 --> 0:15:35,600
But if we look down what's going on in Brazil, right, we've already had thousands of deaths in

147
0:15:35,600 --> 0:15:41,440
children down there, where they are not protecting the kids, over a thousand deaths in babies.

148
0:15:41,440 --> 0:15:46,880
And Brazil is not the size of the US. So just use that as a measure of what happens if you

149
0:15:46,880 --> 0:15:51,920
don't protect the children like we really did here. Now, let's go into another article on this

150
0:15:51,920 --> 0:15:59,280
area. So in JAMA, we saw anybody response to two dose SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine series in

151
0:15:59,280 --> 0:16:04,480
solid organ transplant recipients. This is a little bit of a downer, to be honest.

152
0:16:05,200 --> 0:16:09,840
The authors looked at transplant recipients, right? So there's a question we know in the studies,

153
0:16:09,840 --> 0:16:14,320
only certain people were vaccinated, certain people were excluded. So can the vaccine

154
0:16:14,320 --> 0:16:19,440
protect everyone? Can it protect this particularly vulnerable part of the population?

155
0:16:19,440 --> 0:16:25,040
And so the authors looked at transplant recipients without prior PCR confirmed COVID-19

156
0:16:25,680 --> 0:16:31,360
and they recruited from across the US to participate in this was a prospective cohort study.

157
0:16:32,240 --> 0:16:37,520
They looked at those who completed the two dose SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine series

158
0:16:37,520 --> 0:16:44,320
between December 16, 2020, right? And March 13, 2021. And they followed them up through April

159
0:16:44,320 --> 0:16:52,800
13, 2021. And they were checking a semi-quantitative anti-spike. So looking at seeing what percent of

160
0:16:52,800 --> 0:16:58,320
these folks responded. And the proportion of patients who developed a positive antibody test

161
0:16:59,360 --> 0:17:07,040
after the first dose was only 15%. So they're looking at 658 patients, only 15% of them had a

162
0:17:07,040 --> 0:17:12,320
measurable antibody level after the first dose. And if they checked after the second,

163
0:17:12,320 --> 0:17:19,360
it was only 54%. So only about half of them had a measurable antibody level after the second dose.

164
0:17:19,360 --> 0:17:25,280
We don't know what sort of a level of antibody might be a correlate of immunity.

165
0:17:25,280 --> 0:17:30,960
So caveat here, but the level of antibody that these people were getting, those 54% who even

166
0:17:30,960 --> 0:17:37,200
did test positive was below that of the general population. Now, many of the 12 listeners are

167
0:17:37,200 --> 0:17:42,880
pretty sophisticated, right? So they want to know what about the T cells? We're not seeing T cell

168
0:17:42,880 --> 0:17:48,320
data in this publication. And unfortunately, the studies of T cell responses are even less

169
0:17:48,320 --> 0:17:53,120
encouraging. So we're concerned about these individuals. There's questions about, could we

170
0:17:53,120 --> 0:17:58,320
give them a third dose? Maybe we can somehow get that up. Maybe. And some people have probably

171
0:17:58,320 --> 0:18:03,840
seen ideas that you combine in mRNA with an antiviral vector. Maybe you can sort of get

172
0:18:03,840 --> 0:18:08,800
different augmentation of different parts of the immune system. And that can somehow help these

173
0:18:08,800 --> 0:18:14,480
people. But right now, this is potentially that group of people that the EUA expansion of the

174
0:18:14,480 --> 0:18:20,640
monoclonal might benefit. If you can't make your own antibodies, maybe we can give you those protective

175
0:18:20,640 --> 0:18:26,720
antibodies. So we will see potential expansion into this population in the future.

176
0:18:26,720 --> 0:18:32,240
All right. Remember post exposure, a test does not predict the future. There still is that

177
0:18:32,240 --> 0:18:38,000
two to 14 day incubation period. But then you go into that next stage, should you get infected,

178
0:18:38,000 --> 0:18:44,320
the period of detectable viral replication or the viral symptom phase? Remember, this is the time

179
0:18:44,320 --> 0:18:51,680
for monitoring and monoclonals. And I actually should say, and for education, I will tell a little

180
0:18:51,680 --> 0:18:56,800
bit, well, a couple of stories here about how this is not going as well as I would like it to be

181
0:18:56,800 --> 0:19:03,760
going. So there is an issue with underutilization of monoclonals. So I'm going to share a couple

182
0:19:03,760 --> 0:19:08,720
stories here. But the main one that I'm going to start with is a patient of mine that I mentioned

183
0:19:08,720 --> 0:19:15,280
before. This was that gentleman in his 50s who was diagnosed with his wife. So the two of them

184
0:19:15,280 --> 0:19:19,760
went to an urgent care. They weren't feeling well. This was not a pro health urgent care.

185
0:19:19,760 --> 0:19:27,360
The they were diagnosed with with COVID. They both met criteria for access to monoclonals.

186
0:19:27,920 --> 0:19:33,200
They were offered therapy. So things going well so far. The wife said, yes, that she wanted to go

187
0:19:33,200 --> 0:19:39,600
ahead. 36 hours later, she felt great, right? Got to know her a lot because she was face timing

188
0:19:39,600 --> 0:19:45,120
with the husband. The husband did not do well. The husband felt like he would be just fine and

189
0:19:45,120 --> 0:19:51,200
wanted to take his chances. The urgent care physician did not maybe advise him strongly enough.

190
0:19:52,160 --> 0:19:59,920
He went on to get quite ill, ended up in the hospital, steroids, toe salismab, oxygen,

191
0:19:59,920 --> 0:20:06,160
eventually mechanical ventilation. And this Monday, this gentleman in his 50s died leaving

192
0:20:06,160 --> 0:20:12,720
behind his widow and his children. I mean, I have to say, like if this man came into a medical setting

193
0:20:12,720 --> 0:20:17,440
and he had bacteria in his blood, if he had chest crushing chest pain, we were worried about heart

194
0:20:17,440 --> 0:20:23,920
attack. I'm not sure the urgent care physician or any clinician would be as willing to just sort of

195
0:20:23,920 --> 0:20:31,120
let him go take his chances. I think we really have to appreciate, you know, what an incredible

196
0:20:32,160 --> 0:20:36,160
impact the monoclonal therapy can have on these individuals. And they're sitting on shelves,

197
0:20:36,160 --> 0:20:41,760
right? You know, it's a phone call away. We need to make sure this happens. I just had another

198
0:20:41,760 --> 0:20:47,200
gentleman I admitted today. This gentleman had a BMI of about 40. He went to some urgent care I had

199
0:20:47,200 --> 0:20:53,360
never heard of before, because he felt crummy and wanted to get tested. When he did get a positive

200
0:20:53,360 --> 0:20:58,800
test, initially it was a rapid, they said it was positive. They sent off a PCR. They called him.

201
0:20:58,800 --> 0:21:02,480
They said, your test is positive. He said, Oh, can I come in? I'd like to talk to someone,

202
0:21:02,480 --> 0:21:08,080
find out what to do. They said, Oh, I'm sorry. We don't see positive COVID patients in our

203
0:21:08,080 --> 0:21:12,720
facility. We're worried about the risk of infection. He asked what he was supposed to do. They said,

204
0:21:12,720 --> 0:21:16,640
remember that piece of paper you received? You should read that isolate for 10 days.

205
0:21:16,640 --> 0:21:22,960
He is now he got admitted today on oxygen. He's in the hospital. Again, this is something that

206
0:21:22,960 --> 0:21:27,920
could have been prevented with just a phone call, just a little effort early inflammatory phase.

207
0:21:27,920 --> 0:21:32,960
So now this is that second week. This is for those folks who didn't get monoclonals or weren't

208
0:21:32,960 --> 0:21:40,880
eligible. If room air saturations are less than 94%, that's when we have data that steroids,

209
0:21:40,880 --> 0:21:46,320
six milligrams by mouth, one time a day, times 10 days, you can do IV, but you don't necessarily

210
0:21:46,320 --> 0:21:52,160
need to, but people can just take that pill. This is associated with not only improved outcomes,

211
0:21:52,160 --> 0:21:58,800
but a mortality reduction. This can actually sometimes result in rapid enough improvement

212
0:21:58,800 --> 0:22:04,480
that that person's setting 92, 93 might come back up, might not drop into the 80s, might not

213
0:22:04,480 --> 0:22:10,560
require hospitalization. This is also that period of time when we use that remdesivir,

214
0:22:10,560 --> 0:22:17,520
$3,000 for a five day course, minor impacts. But as I've mentioned, huge expense and no compelling

215
0:22:17,520 --> 0:22:23,520
data on mortality, right? So hear about tons of remdesivir being used in India. Remember,

216
0:22:23,520 --> 0:22:28,960
that's a $3,000 a course medicine. And let's talk a little bit here in a minute about some

217
0:22:28,960 --> 0:22:35,200
alternatives. Anticoagulation for our hospitalized patients improves outcomes and has a mortality

218
0:22:35,200 --> 0:22:40,880
benefit. So the ash guideline panel suggests using prophylactic intensity over intermediate

219
0:22:40,880 --> 0:22:47,840
intensity or therapeutic intensity, anticoagulation in patients with COVID-19 related critical illness

220
0:22:47,840 --> 0:22:53,760
who do not have suspected or confirmed VTE, right? If they've got a clot, it's straightforward. If

221
0:22:53,760 --> 0:23:00,080
they don't, you want to get everyone on anticoagulation. But then they go ahead. And I think that this

222
0:23:00,080 --> 0:23:05,920
is really important. An individual's assessment of the patient's risk of thrombosis and bleeding

223
0:23:05,920 --> 0:23:11,600
is important when deciding on anticoagulation intensity. The panel acknowledges that higher

224
0:23:11,600 --> 0:23:17,760
intensity anticoagulation may be preferred in patients judged to be at high thrombotic risk.

225
0:23:17,760 --> 0:23:22,480
And low bleeding risk. And that might be where we're saying some of this new data we're waiting

226
0:23:22,480 --> 0:23:29,280
for peer review may suggest floor patients on full dose and ICU patients on low dose. But of

227
0:23:29,280 --> 0:23:34,400
course, individualized, keep up with the latest data and look at your patient and make that decision.

228
0:23:34,400 --> 0:23:39,760
This should be made by the treating clinician, not by some institutional algorithm. And we perhaps

229
0:23:39,760 --> 0:23:45,360
do not give as much appreciation as we should that supplemental oxygen is critical. I was talking

230
0:23:45,360 --> 0:23:51,040
to some of my colleagues today in the ICU about that. If a patient starts dropping those oxygen

231
0:23:51,040 --> 0:23:57,200
saturations into the 80s, we definitely want to look at getting them on oxygen. Oxygen saves life.

232
0:23:57,920 --> 0:24:04,400
And we're seeing in India right now what happens if you do not have enough supply of oxygen. And

233
0:24:04,400 --> 0:24:09,520
our listeners might remember how close we got last winter in some of the New York hospitals

234
0:24:09,520 --> 0:24:15,760
and all the upgrades that the hospitals put in place over the summer to allow us to have high

235
0:24:15,760 --> 0:24:21,200
flow oxygen this winter. If we didn't have those upgrades, we would be like, we would have been

236
0:24:21,200 --> 0:24:26,640
like India a little while back to deliver the high flow oxygen that we did that kept so many

237
0:24:26,640 --> 0:24:30,880
people off ventilators. We did not have that infrastructure in place. And we sort of tipped

238
0:24:30,880 --> 0:24:36,080
my hat to the hospital administrators that made the decision to invest that money, right? It was

239
0:24:36,080 --> 0:24:41,520
a great return on that as far as money goes, but a great return on that as far as patient care.

240
0:24:41,520 --> 0:24:46,640
Other pulmonary support measures such as proning have a proven mortality benefit,

241
0:24:46,640 --> 0:24:50,880
but they actually require the providers, particularly the nurses to be involved.

242
0:24:50,880 --> 0:24:56,000
If you just ask a patient and struck them to lay on their belly to turn on their side,

243
0:24:56,000 --> 0:25:00,080
they usually don't want to. When you're having trouble breathing, that's not what you want to do.

244
0:25:00,080 --> 0:25:06,240
So this actually is, I'm going to say, a person-intensive intervention. I can stop by the room. I could

245
0:25:06,240 --> 0:25:10,880
talk to the patient, explain how important it is. But this is the nurses telling them over and over.

246
0:25:10,880 --> 0:25:16,000
The medical assistants, you got to switch position. You got to do this. You got to do that.

247
0:25:16,000 --> 0:25:19,920
This is associated with better outcomes. I want to remind our listeners, right?

248
0:25:20,560 --> 0:25:26,560
Antibiotics are not helpful for treating viral infections and particularly combinations of

249
0:25:26,560 --> 0:25:34,880
renal or kidney toxic medications such as vancomycin, piprosilentesobactam. These can be harmful in a

250
0:25:34,880 --> 0:25:39,680
disease process already associated with a high risk of kidney failure, progression to dialysis

251
0:25:39,680 --> 0:25:44,640
or death. You are not helping your potentially harming your patients. It's not safer to put

252
0:25:44,640 --> 0:25:50,960
them on these renal toxic antibiotics just in case. Now, what about adding tosyllism app to

253
0:25:50,960 --> 0:25:56,400
patients already receiving all these interventions, including steroids? So we have some updates. We

254
0:25:56,400 --> 0:26:02,560
have some new data here. After the randomized embedded multi-factorial adaptive platform

255
0:26:02,560 --> 0:26:08,320
trial for community acquired pneumonia, which is called remap cap study, we saw a survival

256
0:26:08,320 --> 0:26:13,680
benefit in critically ill patients with the use of tosyllism app. And after this, a number of the

257
0:26:13,680 --> 0:26:18,720
hospital systems, they stopped blocking its use and they started to allow its use, but they were

258
0:26:18,720 --> 0:26:25,280
using a very restrictive algorithm. Only allow certain patients who met a rigid set of criteria

259
0:26:25,280 --> 0:26:31,200
oversight by a specific approval person, not even necessarily involved directly in the patient care.

260
0:26:32,240 --> 0:26:35,840
Other hospital systems, really just much like restricted antibiotics,

261
0:26:35,840 --> 0:26:41,360
ask that a specialist be involved in the case and make that decision. Well, the peer reviewed

262
0:26:41,360 --> 0:26:46,880
results of the recovery trial have finally been published. And the recovery trial was looking

263
0:26:46,880 --> 0:26:53,600
at the impact of tosyllism app in a broader hospitalized population. This was published in

264
0:26:53,600 --> 0:27:01,520
the Lancet. Tosyllism app in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 recovery, a randomized

265
0:27:01,520 --> 0:27:08,080
controlled open label platform trial. So as sort of this title says, right, let's get it all in the

266
0:27:08,080 --> 0:27:15,840
title, this was a randomized controlled open label platform trial. So basically the people

267
0:27:15,840 --> 0:27:19,520
that treating clinicians knew whether the person was getting tosyllism app or not,

268
0:27:19,520 --> 0:27:26,160
randomized evaluation of COVID-19 therapy recovery, assessing several possible treatments in the UK.

269
0:27:26,160 --> 0:27:31,840
Now, this was looking at tosyllism app, what we see published here. And the trial participants

270
0:27:31,840 --> 0:27:39,440
with hypoxia, right? So oxygen saturations here, they're using less than 92% evidence of systemic

271
0:27:39,440 --> 0:27:44,800
inflammation. So they're using C-reactive protein greater than or equal to 75 milligrams per liter,

272
0:27:44,800 --> 0:27:52,480
we're eligible for enrollment in this random assignment in a one-to-one ratio to either the

273
0:27:52,480 --> 0:27:58,400
usual standard of care that we've discussed, right? This is going to be anticoagulation, oxygen,

274
0:27:58,400 --> 0:28:06,080
steroids, either plus tosyllism app at a weight-based adjustment. So 400 milligrams to 800 milligrams,

275
0:28:06,080 --> 0:28:13,680
depending on weight given intravenously or not. And a second dose could be given 12 to 24 hours

276
0:28:13,680 --> 0:28:19,840
later if it was felt that the patient's condition had not improved. And the primary outcome was 28

277
0:28:19,840 --> 0:28:26,400
day mortality. So I just want to point out, these are not just ICU patients. These are floor patients

278
0:28:27,200 --> 0:28:34,560
who are requiring oxygen. This is not people not on oxygen. The people say it's about half of the

279
0:28:34,560 --> 0:28:42,400
patients admitted to hospital in the UK would be eligible as per this criteria. So 4,116 adults

280
0:28:42,400 --> 0:28:49,520
were included in the assessment of tosyllism app, including the majority, I'll say, receiving

281
0:28:49,520 --> 0:28:58,000
systemic corticosteroids, as mentioned. Overall, 31% of the patients allocated to tosyllism app

282
0:28:58,000 --> 0:29:05,520
and 35% of the patients allocated to usual care died within 28 days, right? So that was about a

283
0:29:05,520 --> 0:29:13,920
15% reduction in mortality with the addition of tosyllism app to standard of care. Consistent

284
0:29:13,920 --> 0:29:18,960
results were seen in all the pre-specified subgroups of patients, including those, the

285
0:29:18,960 --> 0:29:24,880
majority receiving systemic corticosteroids. Patients allocated to tosyllism app were more

286
0:29:24,880 --> 0:29:34,240
likely to be discharged from the hospital within 28 days, 57% versus 50%. Among those not receiving

287
0:29:34,240 --> 0:29:40,800
invasive mechanical ventilation at baseline, patients allocated tosyllism app were less likely

288
0:29:40,800 --> 0:29:48,080
to reach the composite endpoint of invasive mechanical ventilation or death, 35% versus 42%,

289
0:29:48,080 --> 0:29:54,400
so that was a risk ratio of 0.84. Just to sort of put this all together, right? This is extending

290
0:29:54,400 --> 0:30:01,440
the use of tosyllism app beyond just those critically ill patients. Tosyllism app was associated with

291
0:30:01,440 --> 0:30:08,400
a 15% reduction in death, looking at all the patients and a 16% reduction in the composite

292
0:30:08,400 --> 0:30:14,000
endpoint of mechanical ventilation or death in those not receiving mechanical ventilation at

293
0:30:14,000 --> 0:30:21,360
baseline. They reported only three serious adverse events, which all resolved with standard treatment,

294
0:30:21,360 --> 0:30:26,160
right? So those were three infections. I like to point out that we can treat infections,

295
0:30:26,160 --> 0:30:32,720
but we cannot treat death. When they did an analysis of all the trials today, so there's nine trials

296
0:30:32,720 --> 0:30:38,480
to date, they concluded that if you did a meta-analysis basically, including this trial,

297
0:30:39,040 --> 0:30:48,480
tosyllism app is associated with a significant 14% reduction in 28-day mortality. So I'm hoping

298
0:30:48,480 --> 0:30:54,560
that this trial will do for tosyllism app what the original recovery trial on steroids did for

299
0:30:54,560 --> 0:31:00,880
steroids and more patients will have access to this life-saving therapy. Now they also have a

300
0:31:00,880 --> 0:31:06,720
pre-planned six-month analysis, so we're also going to find out about the long-term outcomes

301
0:31:06,720 --> 0:31:12,080
of these patients. Are we seeing less long COVID? Are we seeing less pulmonary complications,

302
0:31:12,080 --> 0:31:17,200
less neurological complications? So that is pre-planned. We're not going to see that for a number

303
0:31:17,200 --> 0:31:21,680
of months, but we're going to hopefully have that date as we go into the fall of 2021.

304
0:31:21,680 --> 0:31:28,560
Now, what about limitations, right? The study was open-label. It was not blinded placebo

305
0:31:28,560 --> 0:31:34,640
that sort of trial, so the participants and the local staff knew who was getting what treatment.

306
0:31:34,640 --> 0:31:40,720
Among the 1837 patients assigned to tosyllism app, not all of them actually got the drug,

307
0:31:40,720 --> 0:31:46,720
only 84% actually received the drug, so we're sort of an intent to treat analysis here,

308
0:31:46,720 --> 0:31:52,320
so the reported results may actually underestimate the true benefit of tosyllism app in reducing

309
0:31:52,320 --> 0:31:58,640
death. And then given that patients with COVID-19 often have a prolonged hospital course and may

310
0:31:58,640 --> 0:32:04,960
continue to have issues post discharge, 28 days, as mentioned, is not enough. So we're looking

311
0:32:04,960 --> 0:32:11,520
forward to the six-month analysis. What's the long-term outcome with tosyllism app versus not

312
0:32:11,520 --> 0:32:17,760
getting tosyllism app? I'm going to quote the comment in the issue of the Lancet by Shrupti

313
0:32:17,760 --> 0:32:23,920
Gupta and David E. Leif in summary, the recovery trial provides the most definitive evidence thus

314
0:32:23,920 --> 0:32:29,280
far to address the controversy over whether tosyllism app should be added to our armamentarium of

315
0:32:29,280 --> 0:32:36,080
treatments for severely ill patients with COVID-19. The answer is yes. And I certainly want to make

316
0:32:36,080 --> 0:32:43,120
a comment right here on the equity impact, right? Just like monoclonals, this is not an inexpensive

317
0:32:43,120 --> 0:32:50,640
off-the-shelf pennies-adose treatment. But let's look at this, as I think I mentioned before,

318
0:32:50,640 --> 0:32:58,480
remdesivir at $3,000 a course with not really impressive benefit. No compelling mortality benefit

319
0:32:58,480 --> 0:33:04,400
is being used like water over in India. This is a therapy that though the hospitals may charge

320
0:33:04,400 --> 0:33:08,960
thousands of dollars for can be acquired for hundreds of dollars per dose. It's a single dose.

321
0:33:08,960 --> 0:33:14,800
It's not five days. This is something we should be looking at as far as equity and getting this

322
0:33:14,800 --> 0:33:22,080
out to individuals. All right, so I have gone long enough today. I want to finish by reminding

323
0:33:22,080 --> 0:33:28,000
people of our fundraiser. So we are now helping support FIMREC Foundation International Medical

324
0:33:28,000 --> 0:33:33,600
Relief of Children. And as mentioned, this is an organization that had been funded primarily

325
0:33:33,600 --> 0:33:39,840
through young, excited individuals ready to go out there and save the world, ready to volunteer

326
0:33:39,840 --> 0:33:46,160
in all these many parts of the world. And because of the pandemic, that has really been

327
0:33:46,160 --> 0:33:51,440
interrupted. We know, right? Not a lot of young individuals are able to go to these places to

328
0:33:51,440 --> 0:33:57,760
volunteer. That source of support for these clinics has dried up. FIMREC needs your help,

329
0:33:57,760 --> 0:34:03,920
needs our help. So please go to parasiteswithoutborders.com. We are going to try to double your money

330
0:34:03,920 --> 0:34:09,760
to get up to $40,000 to support FIMREC and really the tremendous work that they do throughout the

331
0:34:09,760 --> 0:34:15,840
world. So thank you everyone so far and continue to help us. Time for a few emails for Daniel.

332
0:34:15,840 --> 0:34:22,080
If you want to send one, it's Daniel at micro TV. The first is from an anonymous listener who writes,

333
0:34:22,080 --> 0:34:29,360
My father was recently diagnosed with plasma blastic lymphoma. He received his first dose of

334
0:34:29,360 --> 0:34:34,320
Moderna three weeks before his diagnosis. I know that some people have had a lymphatic

335
0:34:34,320 --> 0:34:40,320
response due to the vaccine. My father's hematologist doesn't think the vaccine caused the lymphoma,

336
0:34:40,320 --> 0:34:45,840
but mentioned it may have caused it to increase the lymphoma's fast growth. Have a couple of

337
0:34:45,840 --> 0:34:51,840
questions. First, how likely do you think my father's hematologist is correct in his belief

338
0:34:51,840 --> 0:34:56,640
that the vaccine may have sped the progression of the lymphoma? Let's take that one first.

339
0:34:57,680 --> 0:35:03,680
Yeah, so I'm going to say, I don't think he's right. I'm sorry. You know, if you think about the

340
0:35:03,680 --> 0:35:08,880
way B cells work and you think about it, lymphoblastic lymphoma. Now, this is going to be B cells that

341
0:35:08,880 --> 0:35:15,680
are basically growing out of control. B cells have a certain specificity. So you would have to

342
0:35:15,680 --> 0:35:22,480
somehow have the same antigen, like this would have to be a COVID specific, a SARS-CoV-2 specific

343
0:35:22,480 --> 0:35:29,200
B cell that was expanding and forming this cancer. The coincidence there is just beyond belief.

344
0:35:29,200 --> 0:35:35,040
We're talking about a one in a trillion chance that your vaccine is going to provide the antigen

345
0:35:35,040 --> 0:35:40,560
that will trigger the B cell receptor of that cancer. So that does not make sense to me.

346
0:35:40,560 --> 0:35:45,520
What we've seen in people get RNA vaccines is sometimes they'll get swollen lymph nodes

347
0:35:46,400 --> 0:35:51,200
in the axilla, in the armpit of the area where the vaccine was given. And we've now

348
0:35:51,200 --> 0:35:55,120
learned from some studies out of the UK that those individuals with the swollen lymph nodes,

349
0:35:55,120 --> 0:36:01,360
these are people that had COVID before. So the vaccine can trigger the lymph nodes to enlarge

350
0:36:01,360 --> 0:36:08,720
significantly if they have B cells in there that have seen the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 before.

351
0:36:08,720 --> 0:36:13,280
But I just think the one in a trillion odds here that you're happening to hit the same B cell

352
0:36:13,280 --> 0:36:18,000
receptor. I don't think that's a connection there. All right. Question number two, my father didn't

353
0:36:18,000 --> 0:36:23,440
get the second Moderna vaccine. He's immunocompromised because of a kidney transplant. He also has

354
0:36:23,440 --> 0:36:28,640
diabetes. How much protection from COVID do you think he'll have from just one shot?

355
0:36:29,840 --> 0:36:35,120
Wow. I feel like this is a planted question because it is perfect. The paper that we just

356
0:36:35,120 --> 0:36:42,080
talked about really would suggest that after one dose, maybe a 15% chance I will even have any

357
0:36:42,080 --> 0:36:48,560
level detective antibody. So I'm going to say at this point, it is most likely that your dad does

358
0:36:48,560 --> 0:36:53,840
not have much protection. And so this is one of the situations where I would say going ahead

359
0:36:53,840 --> 0:36:59,040
with that second vaccine makes sense. And this again, your dad might be a candidate down the

360
0:36:59,040 --> 0:37:05,600
road here for an EUA expansion and a passive protection with monoclonal cocktail. All right.

361
0:37:05,600 --> 0:37:10,880
I think you answered his remaining question. They weren't planning to give him the second dose,

362
0:37:11,920 --> 0:37:15,840
but they're not sure what to do, or should he get a different vaccine?

363
0:37:17,280 --> 0:37:20,240
Yeah. I mean, I'd say that's good because there's really two questions in there.

364
0:37:20,880 --> 0:37:25,920
One is, as I was sort of suggesting earlier, there's been a discussion lately about trying

365
0:37:25,920 --> 0:37:31,040
to combine different vaccines. We're learning about mRNA vaccines in this population.

366
0:37:31,040 --> 0:37:36,560
Maybe we can get a better response with the adenoviral vaccines. Maybe we can get a better

367
0:37:36,560 --> 0:37:42,080
response by sort of combining to. You definitely got to ask that question. Right now your dad is

368
0:37:42,080 --> 0:37:48,160
not protected. We're in a pandemic. We would think that there's some benefit to vaccination.

369
0:37:48,160 --> 0:37:54,800
If your dad gets COVID, his chance of dying is actually really high. So yeah, I understand

370
0:37:54,800 --> 0:37:59,280
your hesitancy to get that second vaccine. I'm going to say that in general, this is a situation

371
0:37:59,280 --> 0:38:03,760
where we usually would recommend going ahead with the second vaccine. All right. Next one is

372
0:38:03,760 --> 0:38:08,560
from Barry, who says, I'd really like to hear your views on the role of budessinide and other

373
0:38:08,560 --> 0:38:14,800
inhaled corticosteroids in mild COVID. The three or so articles I've reviewed seem to reflect the

374
0:38:14,800 --> 0:38:21,040
favorable trend. Many of my colleagues in ambulatory and emergency medicine have prescribed or prescribed

375
0:38:21,040 --> 0:38:26,000
budessinide. I'm uncharacteristically supportive as well, even though I generally stay away from

376
0:38:26,000 --> 0:38:33,200
the sharp cutting edge of clinical medicine. What do you think Daniel? Yeah, you know, I have to say

377
0:38:33,200 --> 0:38:39,040
right. If it was April of 2020, everyone be getting budessinide because there were a few small studies

378
0:38:39,040 --> 0:38:46,880
suggesting maybe some benefit. I think we don't know. I think and I think in in May of 2021,

379
0:38:46,880 --> 0:38:51,600
I think we can say we don't know. We need to study this. We need to know. And then once we know,

380
0:38:51,600 --> 0:38:56,960
we'll be able to recommend. I think it's hopefully time to stop experimenting on our patients and

381
0:38:56,960 --> 0:39:03,680
start providing them with science based advice and guidance. And if there's something out there

382
0:39:03,680 --> 0:39:08,560
that looks interesting, we need to push and make sure it gets properly studied so we can then offer

383
0:39:08,560 --> 0:39:14,560
our patients therapies that actually have proven benefit. All right, stop. Right. My question, my

384
0:39:14,560 --> 0:39:20,080
52 year old boyfriend has hay fever because of pollen. He takes daily antihistamines. He got an

385
0:39:20,080 --> 0:39:25,360
opportunity to vaccinate. And of course, following your number one rule received Moderna, I advised

386
0:39:25,360 --> 0:39:30,400
him to stop taking the antihistamines to let his immune system be at its best. But after one day,

387
0:39:30,400 --> 0:39:36,000
he felt so bad with hay fever that he continued. Was I right to antihistamines interfere with the

388
0:39:36,000 --> 0:39:41,760
efficiency of the body's immune system to produce antibodies? You know, not significantly. Let's

389
0:39:41,760 --> 0:39:46,960
be honest, when it did these huge trials with 10s, 30,000 people per trial on average, right?

390
0:39:47,520 --> 0:39:52,240
You know, people were getting the vaccine, they would take an antihistamine, they take hyperprophen,

391
0:39:52,240 --> 0:39:57,840
they take the seed of minifen. I think if anything, there's been this huge concern that our immune

392
0:39:57,840 --> 0:40:07,040
system is so incredibly fragile. Our immune system is robust. We get sick all the time, right? Your

393
0:40:07,040 --> 0:40:11,120
boyfriend probably fights off the common cold, pollen, antihistamines. Can you imagine that?

394
0:40:11,120 --> 0:40:16,400
Some people take antihistamines while they're fighting off influenza. Antihistamines are not

395
0:40:16,400 --> 0:40:22,960
going to significantly impair a person's ability to respond to a vaccine. We've been giving vaccines

396
0:40:22,960 --> 0:40:27,760
for decades. This has never been an issue. There really is no compelling science. Go ahead,

397
0:40:27,760 --> 0:40:32,320
take that antihistamine. Don't suffer. This has been the worst allergy season in history.

398
0:40:32,960 --> 0:40:38,480
All right, one more sneak an extra one in from Pablo. Two questions. One, patient at high risk,

399
0:40:38,480 --> 0:40:44,720
cerebral palsy, tracheostomy, nonverbal, whose parents are COVID positive. He was not admitted for

400
0:40:44,720 --> 0:40:50,160
bacterial tracheitis. According to EUA rules, I cannot use monoclonal because he's COVID negative.

401
0:40:50,720 --> 0:40:56,880
But once he becomes positive, he is going to be inpatient and likely hypoxic suggestions.

402
0:40:58,400 --> 0:41:02,800
Yeah, so this is tough, right? With the current EUA, we're sort of restricted. I mean, this

403
0:41:02,800 --> 0:41:06,080
this would be one of those where we have the data, like you're sort of saying,

404
0:41:06,080 --> 0:41:12,400
why can't I give this person monoclonal so that they don't get COVID? So this is probably one

405
0:41:12,400 --> 0:41:18,800
person we want to test maybe on a daily basis. Catch them as soon as possible. If you catch someone

406
0:41:18,800 --> 0:41:22,960
in the first day or two, give them monoclonals. I think our studies have suggested that earlier,

407
0:41:22,960 --> 0:41:28,000
you jump in the better. You can really avoid what here sounds like it could be a horrible outcome.

408
0:41:28,720 --> 0:41:33,280
Soon, soon, fingers crossed, we're going to get that EU expansion to use this prophylactic

409
0:41:33,280 --> 0:41:36,320
based on really compelling data of the Regeneron cocktail.

410
0:41:37,280 --> 0:41:42,960
And patient number 200, Tuximab for autoimmune encephalitis got severe COVID pneumonia one

411
0:41:42,960 --> 0:41:48,400
month after the second dose of Moderna after Remdesivir went home, came back a few days later,

412
0:41:48,400 --> 0:41:56,240
CT27, no spike IgG. Is he a candidate for preventive monoclonal? Does the EUA allow it?

413
0:41:57,520 --> 0:42:02,960
Yes, that's a great question. And actually, I have to say, let's go back to what we know

414
0:42:02,960 --> 0:42:08,000
here, because I had a, you know, the CT of 27 is exactly what I recently was dealing with with

415
0:42:08,000 --> 0:42:15,600
the patient who has a GPA, who is not able to clear the virus. The woman that I'm taking care of

416
0:42:15,600 --> 0:42:21,280
actually was infected in December. Her CT value is still in the 20s, right? So what do you do here?

417
0:42:22,320 --> 0:42:27,120
Up at Boston, there was a nice article where they gave convalescent plasma several times.

418
0:42:27,120 --> 0:42:31,840
All they did was get the CT to go up a little bit, get the viral load a little down, and basically

419
0:42:31,840 --> 0:42:37,760
breed resistant variants with convalescent plasma. So that was not helpful. We're concerned that if

420
0:42:37,760 --> 0:42:43,360
you start giving someone who can't mount a good immune response, you know, the cocktail,

421
0:42:43,360 --> 0:42:47,200
that you might do that as well. But this might be a little different the patient you're describing.

422
0:42:47,200 --> 0:42:51,440
This is a patient who seems to have an isolated impairment of B cell function.

423
0:42:51,440 --> 0:42:56,320
Maybe the T cells are still there. So this is a little bit of a gray area.

424
0:42:56,320 --> 0:43:03,120
EUA would not allow access. Compassionate use might. But this is going to be a little bit tricky.

425
0:43:03,120 --> 0:43:08,640
But we'll sort of see you going forward. Right now you're in the gray, the experimental area.

426
0:43:09,600 --> 0:43:13,840
I am not sure, but there certainly is that risk. If you give a person who can't clear the virus

427
0:43:13,840 --> 0:43:20,880
themselves, the monoclonal cocktail with persistence that you might breed a resistant variant.

428
0:43:20,880 --> 0:43:27,520
But no, this is one of those. But boy, what a challenge. That is COVID-19 clinical update number

429
0:43:27,520 --> 0:43:57,360
61 with Dr. Daniel Griffin. Thank you, Daniel. Oh, thank you so much. And everyone be safe.
