0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:06,880
This week in virology, the podcast about viruses, the kind that make you sick.

2
0:00:10,240 --> 0:00:21,120
From MicrobeTV, this is Twiv. This week in virology, episode 803 recorded on September 9th, 2021.

3
0:00:21,120 --> 0:00:26,800
I'm Vincent Dracken-Yellow, and you're listening to the podcast all about viruses. Joining me

4
0:00:26,800 --> 0:00:32,960
today from New York, Daniel Griffin. Hello, everyone. How's the week been, Daniel?

5
0:00:34,160 --> 0:00:40,640
You know, it's a little truncated. Here in New York, we had a long weekend. I guess, well,

6
0:00:40,640 --> 0:00:46,640
most of the country had a long weekend. It was Labor Day, right? Monday was Labor Day,

7
0:00:46,640 --> 0:00:52,640
and I celebrated Labor Day by not laboring. I'll let other people labor. So it's nice to

8
0:00:52,640 --> 0:00:57,760
have a little. I did a lot of sailing, so that was very nice. Time with the family. All right,

9
0:00:57,760 --> 0:01:03,520
but we got lots to cover of. I keep looking to that point when we have less to cover. We're not

10
0:01:03,520 --> 0:01:12,400
there yet. So let me start with my quotation. Life is a long lesson in humility, and that's by James

11
0:01:12,400 --> 0:01:20,880
M. Barrie. I think Peter Pan maybe was something that he created, so. But it seemed appropriate,

12
0:01:20,880 --> 0:01:27,120
because I think science is clearly an arena where this is very much true. And I think it's fair to

13
0:01:27,120 --> 0:01:32,960
say science is a lifelong lesson in humility. That's why we do science because we don't know the

14
0:01:32,960 --> 0:01:39,600
answers. So science is really, I like to say, a journey of discovery, not a path to confirmation.

15
0:01:40,160 --> 0:01:43,520
If we know all the answers, we would not have to do the experiments or the trials.

16
0:01:43,520 --> 0:01:52,640
This episode is going to drop on 9-11, so I just want to just sort of take a moment there.

17
0:01:52,640 --> 0:02:01,280
You know, I grew up in New York, so that was really sort of a difficult day for a lot of us.

18
0:02:03,840 --> 0:02:11,840
All right, let's get into a number of papers here. The quotation I start with

19
0:02:11,840 --> 0:02:18,080
really is something that has been addressed. I've seen a number of papers recently,

20
0:02:18,640 --> 0:02:23,120
and one of them, actually a couple of them, I think are in open forum infectious diseases.

21
0:02:23,840 --> 0:02:30,080
And the first overlooked shortcomings of observational studies of interventions in

22
0:02:30,080 --> 0:02:36,640
coronavirus disease 2019, an illustrated review for the clinician, right? And so, you know,

23
0:02:36,640 --> 0:02:41,600
these updates, I don't know if our listeners remember, they really started off theoretically

24
0:02:41,600 --> 0:02:47,200
as a clinician update. So I like to keep that focus, but I think we have non-clinicians that

25
0:02:47,200 --> 0:02:53,680
listen, right? But let me just read the abstract here, because over the last two years, this has

26
0:02:53,680 --> 0:02:59,360
been a rapid education, re-education for a lot of clinicians when something gets published.

27
0:03:00,800 --> 0:03:04,560
It gets thrown out there as a pre-print, it gets interpreted in the media,

28
0:03:04,560 --> 0:03:11,920
and a lot of clinicians are trying to decide what to do based, unfortunately, on a lot of

29
0:03:11,920 --> 0:03:18,560
observational studies that may not have been done that well. So let me just read the abstract here.

30
0:03:18,560 --> 0:03:24,560
The rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome, coronavirus, to infection across the globe,

31
0:03:24,560 --> 0:03:30,560
triggered an unprecedented increase in research activities that resulted in an astronomical

32
0:03:30,560 --> 0:03:37,520
publication output of observational studies. However, most studies fail to apply fully the

33
0:03:37,520 --> 0:03:43,920
necessary methodological techniques that systematically deal with different biases and confounding,

34
0:03:43,920 --> 0:03:49,120
which not only limits their scientific merit, but may result in harm through misleading

35
0:03:49,120 --> 0:03:55,840
information. And, you know, I am going to highly recommend that all clinicians take the time to

36
0:03:55,840 --> 0:04:03,440
read this. I think this is really critical. And it's only an eight-page paper. It's not

37
0:04:03,440 --> 0:04:10,560
terrible to read. You know, our goal is discovering what's true as clinicians. You know, when you go

38
0:04:10,560 --> 0:04:14,880
see the clinician, you want them to tell you what's true, not just what they're excited about.

39
0:04:15,520 --> 0:04:20,240
And, unfortunately, as we've seen over the last two years, there's been a lot of poorly

40
0:04:20,240 --> 0:04:26,800
done studies that actually got people excited about stuff that turned out not to make a difference,

41
0:04:26,800 --> 0:04:33,840
right? And they talk in this paper about several of these issues. So one, treatment selection bias.

42
0:04:34,400 --> 0:04:39,840
Maybe we remember that vitamin D study that we all got excited about. And then some savvy people

43
0:04:39,840 --> 0:04:44,640
in Spain realized that they were giving vitamin D to the people in the healthier, less acute wards,

44
0:04:44,640 --> 0:04:50,560
but not giving it to people with severe disease and more issues. And so, yeah, young, healthy people

45
0:04:50,560 --> 0:04:56,960
do better. So was it really the vitamin D? And that was not helpful if anything that was misleading.

46
0:04:57,840 --> 0:05:02,800
Then there's survivor bias, right? You know, you decide you're going to enroll someone in a

47
0:05:02,800 --> 0:05:08,240
treatment. And they have to live long enough to get the treatment. So there's sort of this immortal

48
0:05:08,240 --> 0:05:14,000
period introduced. So it's important that we understand that. And then there's these competing

49
0:05:14,000 --> 0:05:19,440
risks, like if our endpoint is discharged from the hospital, what happens afterwards have we

50
0:05:19,440 --> 0:05:26,000
excluded them, not follow them into discharge. So there's really, I think this is really great.

51
0:05:26,000 --> 0:05:31,840
There is a role for observational studies, but this paper just reinforces how important it is

52
0:05:31,840 --> 0:05:37,040
designing, conducting, and then really, I'm going to say the integrity of publishing

53
0:05:37,040 --> 0:05:43,280
helpful, reliable information. Because if you get something out there, and it supports something

54
0:05:43,280 --> 0:05:47,840
because of one of these biases or poor study design, that's not helpful. It's more than not

55
0:05:47,840 --> 0:05:53,040
helpful. It's actually can be harmful. The other paper that I enjoyed this last week,

56
0:05:54,160 --> 0:06:00,080
got all this extra time, right? So I could read critical review of the scientific evidence and

57
0:06:00,080 --> 0:06:07,840
recommendations in COVID-19 management guidelines. This is really enlightening. I get to see some

58
0:06:07,840 --> 0:06:14,000
of this as I'm involved in the care of patients at multiple health systems, also involved in the

59
0:06:14,000 --> 0:06:20,080
outpatient setting. And I talked to our providers across the tri-state area. Well, I tend to look

60
0:06:20,080 --> 0:06:27,040
to professional societies or government resources like the IDSA, the NIH, American Society Hematology,

61
0:06:27,040 --> 0:06:33,440
or the CDC. This paper gives a good description of the landscape. There are actually hundreds of

62
0:06:33,440 --> 0:06:38,800
different recommendations out there. Only about half of the ones out there really have any assessment

63
0:06:38,800 --> 0:06:44,720
of the supporting evidence. And there's actually quite a bit of discrepancies between different

64
0:06:44,720 --> 0:06:51,600
guidelines. And I actually think this speaks to this vacuum created by a lack of well-designed

65
0:06:51,600 --> 0:06:58,240
randomized controlled trials. It also might speak to an issue with who creates these guidelines,

66
0:06:58,240 --> 0:07:05,040
right? Each hospital health care system physician group out there creating their own treatment

67
0:07:05,040 --> 0:07:10,800
guidelines in this void. I mean, I might, like for instance, there are guidelines for treatment

68
0:07:10,800 --> 0:07:15,440
at Columbia University, or recommended by a professional society. But then I go to a certain

69
0:07:15,440 --> 0:07:23,600
hospital, oh, we don't do that here. So this is a challenge, and I think this is another area.

70
0:07:23,600 --> 0:07:30,880
But I shouldn't complain, right? I have colleagues in rural parts of the American West, and they're

71
0:07:30,880 --> 0:07:35,760
probably listening and saying, Dr. Griffin, you don't need to complain, we have it worse.

72
0:07:36,320 --> 0:07:41,680
And I won't even go into the details. You can just use your imagination, but you can imagine some

73
0:07:41,680 --> 0:07:47,680
of the guidelines in certain areas of the world and our country. All right, let's get right into

74
0:07:47,680 --> 0:07:55,040
children, COVID and mental health. As I've been saying for quite a while, children are at lower

75
0:07:55,040 --> 0:08:01,600
risk, but they are not at no risk. And I think everyone is really waking up to this. Wearing a

76
0:08:01,600 --> 0:08:06,080
mask is less dramatic for a child than being hospitalized. And I'm going to add a new one.

77
0:08:06,080 --> 0:08:11,680
Children should not have to choose between health and education. So I've talked a lot about the

78
0:08:11,680 --> 0:08:20,080
American Academy of Pediatrics, which has a COVID tracking. The CDC also has a data tracking page,

79
0:08:20,080 --> 0:08:26,320
specifically looking at pediatric data. So you can look at this, and it's just it's outstanding.

80
0:08:26,320 --> 0:08:31,680
We're over over a quarter million children were infected with COVID in the last week.

81
0:08:32,240 --> 0:08:38,960
Hospitalizations are going up. Just anyone who is still sort of in this idea that for children,

82
0:08:38,960 --> 0:08:45,440
COVID is not a problem. The heads in the sand, the information is out there. Yes, two years ago,

83
0:08:45,440 --> 0:08:50,720
18 months ago, when our I was give moms the credit, and I think I should in most cases,

84
0:08:50,720 --> 0:08:55,520
when the moms were keeping the kids safe, despite what people were saying, if a kid does not get

85
0:08:55,520 --> 0:09:01,600
exposed to COVID-19, if they don't get infected with COVID-19, it's not a problem. But now children,

86
0:09:02,400 --> 0:09:06,240
enormous number of children, I think we're over 6 million children have been infected with COVID

87
0:09:06,240 --> 0:09:15,120
in this country. So we did get some data from the post MMWR, two really informative publications,

88
0:09:15,760 --> 0:09:22,160
trends in COVID-19 cases, emergency department visits, and hospital admissions among children

89
0:09:22,160 --> 0:09:31,040
and adolescents aged 0 to 17 years. This is United States August 2020 to August 2021.

90
0:09:31,040 --> 0:09:40,480
And so here the CDC analyzed COVID-19 cases, ED visits with a COVID-19 diagnosis, hospital admissions,

91
0:09:41,600 --> 0:09:48,480
and overall COVID-19 ED visits and hospital admissions increased since June 2021 in children

92
0:09:48,480 --> 0:09:56,320
and adolescents. The rate per 100,000 persons of COVID-19 admissions in August 2021 in the

93
0:09:56,320 --> 0:10:01,520
quartile of states with the lowest vaccination rate was almost four times higher than the quartile

94
0:10:01,520 --> 0:10:06,960
with the highest vaccination coverage, right? Think about, most of these kids are not eligible,

95
0:10:06,960 --> 0:10:13,360
so a lot of the impact here we're seeing is adults getting vaccinated and the benefit that

96
0:10:13,360 --> 0:10:20,800
can provide. We also saw second publication hospitalizations associated with COVID-19 among

97
0:10:20,800 --> 0:10:30,400
children and adolescents. COVID-19 states March 1, 2020 to August 14, 2021. Here they reported

98
0:10:30,400 --> 0:10:37,440
that the weekly COVID-19 associated hospitalization rates among children and adolescents rose nearly

99
0:10:37,440 --> 0:10:45,520
five-fold during late June to mid-August 2021. The proportions of hospitalized children and

100
0:10:45,520 --> 0:10:52,720
adolescents with severe disease was similar before. And during this period of Delta predominance,

101
0:10:54,560 --> 0:10:59,840
hospitalization rates were 10 times higher among the unvaccinated than among the fully

102
0:10:59,840 --> 0:11:05,680
adolescent, fully vaccinated adolescents. So that's looking at the vaccine eligible group.

103
0:11:06,640 --> 0:11:11,360
So I think just important information that we have here, it's great that this is being tracked.

104
0:11:11,360 --> 0:11:16,720
This is important when parents are making decisions, when adolescents are involved in

105
0:11:16,720 --> 0:11:23,920
shared decision-making about vaccines. Yeah, I'm not sure why people are so sensitive.

106
0:11:23,920 --> 0:11:29,760
Whenever I talk about children and COVID, I'm just sharing the information. So pre-exposure

107
0:11:29,760 --> 0:11:36,640
period transmission testing never miss an opportunity to test. I just did a keynote talk earlier today

108
0:11:36,640 --> 0:11:43,840
about testing. And usually this is the area where I'm trying to reinforce antigen testing,

109
0:11:44,720 --> 0:11:52,480
talking about PCR detection, talking about how actually antigen tests maybe have been compared

110
0:11:52,480 --> 0:11:59,120
against the wrong gold standard. Maybe if you compare those antigen tests against viral culture,

111
0:11:59,120 --> 0:12:06,080
against contact tracing, against transmission. I think I'm going to say that antigen tests used

112
0:12:06,080 --> 0:12:10,960
during that two days before, three to five days after symptom, during the period of time we see

113
0:12:10,960 --> 0:12:18,800
transmission, even at home antigen tests were in the high 90s. So they are not an issue with lack

114
0:12:18,800 --> 0:12:25,280
of sensitivity during that period. Once a person is past that period stage, once the viral RNA is low

115
0:12:25,280 --> 0:12:29,520
and the viral antigen gets to a very low level, yes, the antigen test will turn negative,

116
0:12:30,160 --> 0:12:34,800
use the right test at the right time to ask the right question. But today I'm going to talk

117
0:12:34,800 --> 0:12:42,320
about serology. We had a couple interesting studies looking at serology. It's going to be

118
0:12:42,320 --> 0:12:49,680
serology positivity. One is the U.S., the other Kenya, both published in JAMA. So the first one

119
0:12:50,240 --> 0:12:56,960
estimated U.S. infection and vaccine-induced SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence based on blood donations

120
0:12:56,960 --> 0:13:08,320
July 2020 to May 2021. So this is a repeated cross-sectional study that included 1,443,519

121
0:13:08,320 --> 0:13:15,200
blood donation specimens from a catchment area representing 74% of the U.S. population.

122
0:13:16,320 --> 0:13:23,360
They reported that general population increased. This is really what's sort of the money here.

123
0:13:23,360 --> 0:13:30,640
83.3% had a combined infection or vaccine-induced antibodies. It's actually pretty high, I have to

124
0:13:30,640 --> 0:13:36,800
say. The authors looked at both spike and nucleocapsid antibodies, nucleocapsid being associated

125
0:13:36,800 --> 0:13:42,880
with infection, spike being from either. This is a very high number. I think there's a couple

126
0:13:42,880 --> 0:13:48,640
things to point out. People that donate blood are not necessarily representative of everyone.

127
0:13:48,640 --> 0:13:53,600
But there was, I'll say, a little bit of a disturbing feature here. If you looked at this,

128
0:13:54,320 --> 0:13:59,440
the infection-induced seroprevalence was consistently highest in Hispanic,

129
0:14:00,320 --> 0:14:05,920
non-Hispanic Black individuals. The Caucasians are getting their immunity from vaccination.

130
0:14:06,640 --> 0:14:10,160
Other populations are getting it disproportionately from infection.

131
0:14:10,160 --> 0:14:19,840
Now, the second article, so here, most people in this first study are getting their positivity,

132
0:14:19,840 --> 0:14:25,280
their immunity from vaccination. I think we're up to 75% of the U.S. population has gotten the

133
0:14:25,280 --> 0:14:31,520
first dose. 75% of eligible. Remember, we still have a large chunk of our population, the children

134
0:14:31,520 --> 0:14:38,000
that are not eligible. The second article was a situation where there was limited access to

135
0:14:38,000 --> 0:14:43,920
vaccines. And this was prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies from a national sero surveillance

136
0:14:43,920 --> 0:14:51,520
of Kenyan blood donors, January through March 2021. And in this article, the authors report

137
0:14:51,520 --> 0:14:58,080
about seroprevolence in Kenya. This is a surveillance study looking at blood donors,

138
0:14:58,080 --> 0:15:04,880
aged 16 to 64, slightly different age demographic in Kenya. We don't have as many folks over the

139
0:15:04,880 --> 0:15:13,680
age of 65. The national prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was estimated at various points in time,

140
0:15:14,720 --> 0:15:21,920
basically getting to sort of the end, the crude seroprevalence had gotten to as high as 44.2.

141
0:15:22,640 --> 0:15:27,120
And this is actually in line with what we're seeing in a lot of other areas. But remember,

142
0:15:27,120 --> 0:15:36,080
this is dominantly coming from exposure from infection. The Kenya COVID-19 vaccine program

143
0:15:36,720 --> 0:15:43,040
only began in March of 2021. So a little bit, and there were only up to 2% of the population

144
0:15:43,040 --> 0:15:53,360
by July 2021. So most of that is from infection. All right, active vaccination. There's always

145
0:15:53,360 --> 0:15:59,680
news on this front. Never miss an opportunity to vaccinate vaccination is how this pandemic ends.

146
0:16:00,400 --> 0:16:05,840
Wednesday, September 1st, right, Madhiran announced its completed submission for full approval

147
0:16:05,840 --> 0:16:12,480
of its mRNA vaccine. So we're hoping we're going to see that coming up on the horizon.

148
0:16:12,480 --> 0:16:18,080
Why does this matter, right? It actually seems like it does when I talk to my patients. I was

149
0:16:18,080 --> 0:16:25,680
talking to an unvaccinated woman earlier this week. And she was not vaccinated. And she said

150
0:16:25,680 --> 0:16:31,120
she was not interested in getting vaccinated until she heard about this new licensed vaccine called

151
0:16:31,120 --> 0:16:36,320
comarinate. And she's very excited to get comarinate as soon as that is available.

152
0:16:37,360 --> 0:16:42,240
So I think once we have the ability for people to get spike-vax,

153
0:16:42,240 --> 0:16:47,280
I was talking to one of the nurses today and asked, you know, what would you choose the comarinity

154
0:16:47,280 --> 0:16:56,400
or the spike-vax? I choose Spike Lee. Okay. So I think this stuff matters, actually. People seem

155
0:16:56,400 --> 0:17:01,840
to care. And the other thing, right? I mean, I was not going to include, how can you not talk

156
0:17:01,840 --> 0:17:07,760
about boosters? That's all anyone wants to talk about. So what about the data from Israel to

157
0:17:07,760 --> 0:17:14,720
boosters? So this is my plug for Shane Crotty. I listened to the Shane Crotty episode. Shane

158
0:17:14,720 --> 0:17:18,960
Crotty is actually one of the people that I reach out to when I've got an immunology question.

159
0:17:19,600 --> 0:17:25,760
He's brilliant. He's actually an individual, the WHO, and a lot of other people turn to when they

160
0:17:25,760 --> 0:17:31,200
really want to know what the science shows. And if you go to the Twiv episode right before this,

161
0:17:32,560 --> 0:17:37,600
it's great because everyone's asking him questions. And Shane Crotty is so good. He basically

162
0:17:37,600 --> 0:17:42,800
this is what the science says. He doesn't get ahead of the science. You don't get Shane Crotty's

163
0:17:42,800 --> 0:17:48,960
opinion. You get this is what the science is telling us. So if people really want a deep dive,

164
0:17:48,960 --> 0:17:53,680
you know, spend that. I think he's on for about the first hour, but then stay for the rest of the

165
0:17:53,680 --> 0:17:59,200
show. But that that is really great. But what what created all this fuss? And I'm just going to spend

166
0:17:59,200 --> 0:18:06,320
a moment on this. The preprint correlation of SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infections to time from

167
0:18:06,320 --> 0:18:14,160
vaccine preliminary study was put up as a preprint. Now, a number of statisticians, mathematicians

168
0:18:14,160 --> 0:18:19,680
have got a chance to really look at this. And some of the other data you can bring down from the

169
0:18:19,680 --> 0:18:26,320
Israeli dashboards of public accessible data. And yesterday, I got to listen to a really great

170
0:18:26,320 --> 0:18:31,600
analysis of this data presented by one of my colleagues, Ephraim Castillo. He's one of the

171
0:18:31,600 --> 0:18:38,960
senior VPs at Optum with whom I work. And he really explained all about how this data was not

172
0:18:38,960 --> 0:18:44,640
originally correctly analyzed, explained a bit about Simpson's paradox, where if you don't break

173
0:18:44,640 --> 0:18:50,720
it down and look at the data correctly, it can be concerning. But he went ahead and broke down

174
0:18:51,680 --> 0:18:59,040
the data by a number of narrower age bands. And really looked at, okay, if you look at a place

175
0:18:59,040 --> 0:19:06,240
like Israel, if you look at the population, say 90+, over 90% are vaccinated. Actually,

176
0:19:06,240 --> 0:19:11,520
over 70, if you look at people over the age of 70, really, if you go to people 60 and up,

177
0:19:11,520 --> 0:19:16,720
the majority over 90% are vaccinated, right? These people, you've greatly reduced their risk,

178
0:19:16,720 --> 0:19:21,360
but they're still the high risk of ending. And if you go through each, what is the efficacy we're

179
0:19:21,360 --> 0:19:29,040
seeing for prevention of severe disease, you're seeing in the oldest population an 82-fold reduction

180
0:19:29,040 --> 0:19:35,920
in risk in efficacy versus severe disease of over 90%. And you sort of march all the way down. You

181
0:19:35,920 --> 0:19:41,280
actually get to the youngest individuals under 30, and you're looking at close to 100% in the 30

182
0:19:41,280 --> 0:19:48,160
to 39, 96.8%. So properly analyzed, I continue to not be concerned by this data.

183
0:19:48,160 --> 0:19:53,680
Shane Crotty talked a little bit about, you know, are we concerned about infection?

184
0:19:54,400 --> 0:19:58,880
Is there a potential that that's going to be tied in with transmission potential for long

185
0:19:58,880 --> 0:20:04,640
COVID? We'll have to see. But I think this is just when you look at it correctly, there's no reason

186
0:20:04,640 --> 0:20:10,960
for panic. The booster study, the booster decisions will be addressed, but you don't need to run out.

187
0:20:10,960 --> 0:20:15,920
I get questions every day. Should I run out? If we're going to follow the science, the science

188
0:20:15,920 --> 0:20:23,840
is not pushing us. All right, passive vaccination. I'm almost delighted how much my colleagues have

189
0:20:23,840 --> 0:20:29,920
taken advantage of the prophylactic indication for monoclonals. So let me just reinforce this here.

190
0:20:30,720 --> 0:20:40,640
So a bit back, the Regeneron cocktail, Regeneron Cove, was given an expansion of its EUA for post

191
0:20:40,640 --> 0:20:49,520
exposure prophylaxis. So the US FDA issued an EUA of all these three letter acronyms, TLA's,

192
0:20:49,520 --> 0:20:57,760
to permit the emergency use of Regeneron Cove for post exposure prophylaxis in individuals

193
0:20:57,760 --> 0:21:03,760
who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19. And who are these individuals? So one,

194
0:21:03,760 --> 0:21:10,080
not fully vaccinated, or they were vaccinated, but you have doubts about their ability to

195
0:21:10,080 --> 0:21:16,400
mount an adequate immune response, an individual who is on immunosuppressive medications,

196
0:21:18,320 --> 0:21:24,000
or, as they say, at high risk of exposure to an individual infected because of occurrence in a,

197
0:21:24,000 --> 0:21:30,000
let's say, a nursing home or an institutional setting such as a prison. So I've actually added

198
0:21:31,200 --> 0:21:37,600
this as part of my history of present illness. Once I get through with the patient, I say,

199
0:21:37,600 --> 0:21:42,080
all right, this is great. Now we have a plan for what we're going to do for you, but let's talk

200
0:21:42,080 --> 0:21:46,960
about everyone else that you may have exposed who is either exposed and might benefit for

201
0:21:46,960 --> 0:21:53,680
prophylaxis or is already infected and might benefit from early treatment. You know, I have to say

202
0:21:53,680 --> 0:22:01,040
this has really been tremendous in the tri-state area. We are seeing a low number of our pro-health

203
0:22:01,040 --> 0:22:07,600
and our optometri-state folks end up in the hospital because we are doing, I say, a tremendous amount

204
0:22:07,600 --> 0:22:13,600
of getting these individuals in for the monoclonals, keeping them out of the hospital. And a lot of

205
0:22:13,600 --> 0:22:21,280
the health systems have really helped support access, you know, tip my hat again to the Catholic

206
0:22:21,280 --> 0:22:27,200
hospitals, really jumped in and helped us with this. All right, I'm going to jump right to the

207
0:22:27,200 --> 0:22:34,320
early inflammatory phase, right? So we did have an update, an update from the American Society of

208
0:22:34,320 --> 0:22:40,160
Hematology, living guidelines on the use of anticoagulation for thrombo-prophylaxis

209
0:22:40,160 --> 0:22:47,760
in patients with COVID-19. And this was an update on the use of anticoagulation in critically ill

210
0:22:47,760 --> 0:22:54,400
patients. Full disclosure, I'm one of the authors on this. But this was a recommendation

211
0:22:54,400 --> 0:23:02,560
regarding patients in the hospital who are requiring critical care. So these are either patients in

212
0:23:02,560 --> 0:23:09,280
ICU, but it's not geographic. So it's patients who require that level of support, really in favor

213
0:23:09,280 --> 0:23:17,280
of prophylactic intensity anticoagulation here. So this is that issue that a patient in the ICU,

214
0:23:17,840 --> 0:23:23,120
though at increased risk of clotting from COVID-19. And we know that COVID-19 patients have an

215
0:23:23,120 --> 0:23:29,680
increased risk. We felt reviewing the available literature that the risk of bleeding and associated

216
0:23:29,680 --> 0:23:37,840
mortality was in favor of prophylactic intensity in that setting. So what's sort of the standard

217
0:23:37,840 --> 0:23:41,600
right here? A patient ends up in the hospital, right? They're usually there because they're

218
0:23:41,600 --> 0:23:49,280
hypoxic. The rubair oxygen level is below 94%. Somehow they've either not been vaccinated,

219
0:23:49,280 --> 0:23:54,640
where they've missed the monoclonals or that small percent of people that progress. The

220
0:23:54,640 --> 0:24:01,840
standard is to start anticoagulation. Here's a little more guidance on dosing. The remdesivir,

221
0:24:01,840 --> 0:24:07,200
the dexamethasone. But what if they progress, right? We've talked about patients that are

222
0:24:07,200 --> 0:24:14,160
requiring more oxygen support. We've talked about tosyllizumab in the past. But what if there's a

223
0:24:14,160 --> 0:24:19,680
shortage of tosyllizumab as we're seeing in many parts of the country? Are there other options?

224
0:24:19,680 --> 0:24:24,400
Well, there is another option that is in the guidelines, but let's talk about a publication

225
0:24:24,400 --> 0:24:30,240
in the Lancet that just came out. This was in the Lancet Respiratory Medicine, efficacy and

226
0:24:30,240 --> 0:24:36,800
safety of barisatinib for the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. This is the

227
0:24:36,800 --> 0:24:44,880
cold barrier study. This was a randomized double-blind parallel group placebo-controlled phase 3 trial.

228
0:24:46,400 --> 0:24:52,800
So this is, as I like to say, the much-awaited results of the cold barrier study. So as, you know,

229
0:24:52,800 --> 0:24:58,640
really in the title, this was a phase 3 double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial.

230
0:24:58,640 --> 0:25:05,440
Participants were enrolled from 101 centers across 12 countries in Asia, Europe, North America,

231
0:25:05,440 --> 0:25:10,400
South America. Hospitalized adults with COVID-19 received standard of care,

232
0:25:11,520 --> 0:25:19,360
were randomized one-to-one to either receive once daily barisatinib for milligrams or matched

233
0:25:19,360 --> 0:25:26,800
placebo for up to 14 days. The standard of care included corticosteroids such as dexamethasone,

234
0:25:26,800 --> 0:25:33,120
antivirals, remdesivir. They reported the 28-day, all-cause mortality was 8%

235
0:25:33,120 --> 0:25:42,160
for the 62 folks in the barisatinib and 13% for the 100 in the placebo group,

236
0:25:42,160 --> 0:25:49,680
reporting a 38.2% relative reduction in mortality. There's a one additional death was prevented

237
0:25:49,680 --> 0:25:57,200
per 20 treated, so a 20 number needed to treat to prevent one death. The 60-day, all-cause mortality

238
0:25:57,200 --> 0:26:05,280
was 10% for barisatinib, 15% for placebo. The frequencies of serious adverse events were similar

239
0:26:05,280 --> 0:26:14,880
between the two groups. So what is this drug, Dr. Griffin? Barisatinib is a Janus kinase

240
0:26:14,880 --> 0:26:20,720
inhibitor. It interferes with the jack stat signaling pathway, and the thought is this is

241
0:26:20,720 --> 0:26:28,640
actually reducing cytokine, particularly IL-6 production. Thus, the idea we were concerned,

242
0:26:29,040 --> 0:26:34,960
using tosyllizumab and IL-6 receptor blocker without steroids because the IL-6 levels would

243
0:26:34,960 --> 0:26:41,280
shoot up. Here, you're using this agent that actually reduces IL-6 production. In some other

244
0:26:41,280 --> 0:26:47,760
studies, if you're unable to use steroids, this is still something that you could potentially use.

245
0:26:47,760 --> 0:26:53,120
And actually, I'll say this is something that the IDSA has in their recommendations,

246
0:26:53,120 --> 0:26:57,600
where they're saying, among hospitalized patients who are progressing, elevated

247
0:26:57,600 --> 0:27:02,800
inflammatory markers, this is something you can consider, and also something you can consider

248
0:27:02,800 --> 0:27:10,800
in a patient for whom steroids cannot be given for whatever reason. Long COVID, and I think it's

249
0:27:10,800 --> 0:27:17,440
become really clear, but I'm going to add this to my list of pithy quotations. COVID is not just a

250
0:27:17,440 --> 0:27:21,600
two-week viral illness for many people. I'm going to know early on, we had a lot of people

251
0:27:21,600 --> 0:27:26,000
saying, you know, with COVID, either live or you die, you know, in this perception that it was two

252
0:27:26,000 --> 0:27:33,840
weeks. But in the MMWR, the article, long-term symptoms among adults tested for SARS-CoV-2,

253
0:27:33,840 --> 0:27:40,480
United States January 2020 to April 2021. This is hot off the press today, as we're recording.

254
0:27:41,200 --> 0:27:48,560
And in this report, the authors administered a nationwide internet survey to 698 U.S. adults,

255
0:27:48,560 --> 0:27:55,920
aged greater or equal to 18 years of age with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. And they compared them

256
0:27:55,920 --> 0:28:04,160
to 2,437 with a negative test. 2,750 had never been tested. And they reported for those with a

257
0:28:04,160 --> 0:28:12,960
positive test, 65.9% had symptoms persisting for greater than four weeks. Now, the usual suspects,

258
0:28:13,520 --> 0:28:19,200
fatigue, change in smell or taste, shortness of breath, cough, headache. But I'll say the same

259
0:28:19,200 --> 0:28:23,520
challenges that we talked about previously in the adolescent study. There's a lot of background.

260
0:28:23,520 --> 0:28:28,320
Now, we're seeing this above background. But a lot of challenges in sorting that out.

261
0:28:28,320 --> 0:28:34,160
But I will say, this is another point in the line, you know, that long COVID is a real thing.

262
0:28:34,160 --> 0:28:41,040
And a significant percent of people are not just better after two weeks. Now, there was also a

263
0:28:41,040 --> 0:28:48,400
preprint posted severe COVID-19 is associated with sustained biochemical disturbances and

264
0:28:48,400 --> 0:28:54,880
prolonged symptomatology, a retrospective, retrospective single center cohort study.

265
0:28:55,600 --> 0:28:59,520
This is a paper that's up as a preprint, but it's submitted to the Journal of Critical

266
0:28:59,520 --> 0:29:04,400
Medicine. So it'll go through peer review. I'm one of the authors, right? So it's not

267
0:29:04,400 --> 0:29:12,240
talking a couple of my publications this time or preprint postings. And this really describes a

268
0:29:12,240 --> 0:29:20,400
cohort of 168 patients with severe COVID-19 previously hospitalized and describes how in this cohort

269
0:29:21,200 --> 0:29:25,680
they have sustained biochemical disturbances, elevated ferritin,

270
0:29:25,680 --> 0:29:32,880
de-dimer, elevated neutrophil lymphocyte ratio. So it's nice to start having some objective data.

271
0:29:33,440 --> 0:29:39,840
There's been a lot of ideas about what drives long COVID discussion about viral persistence,

272
0:29:39,840 --> 0:29:45,440
continued antigenic stimuli. There's always been a lot of thought that this is something with the

273
0:29:45,440 --> 0:29:50,800
immune system. So it's just nice to have some objective, maybe some breadcrumbs here to start

274
0:29:50,800 --> 0:29:56,080
to understand and hopefully be able to help these individuals. What about low and middle

275
0:29:56,080 --> 0:30:01,520
income countries and COVID? No one is safe until everyone is safe. I've been having this discussion

276
0:30:01,520 --> 0:30:07,760
quite a bit that it is the right thing to do. It is the selfish thing to do to immunize the world.

277
0:30:07,760 --> 0:30:14,720
Where are all these variants coming from that's keeping everyone awake at night? And we heard from

278
0:30:14,720 --> 0:30:21,280
the White House COVID advisor, Jeffrey Zietz, that the US plans to invest $3 billion in the

279
0:30:21,280 --> 0:30:26,640
vaccine supply chain as it continues to work to position itself as a leading supplier of vaccines

280
0:30:26,640 --> 0:30:33,600
for the world. I heard some interesting musings by Anthony Fauci about maybe using the PEPFAR network

281
0:30:33,600 --> 0:30:40,240
to help with vaccines. But then we just heard that COVAX, a global program to distribute COVID-19

282
0:30:40,240 --> 0:30:48,000
vaccines, cut its 2021 forecast for available doses by one quarter. And there was what I thought

283
0:30:48,000 --> 0:30:54,640
was an interesting disturbing New York Times article by Benjamin Mueller and Daniel E. Slotnick.

284
0:30:55,360 --> 0:31:01,920
Let me quote, in its latest projection, the global immunization program known as COVAX

285
0:31:01,920 --> 0:31:08,640
said that it expected to have a total of only, I'm throwing in only 1.4 billion doses available by

286
0:31:08,640 --> 0:31:16,000
the end of 2021. In June, the program had said that it expected to have access to 1.9 billion doses

287
0:31:16,000 --> 0:31:22,560
this year. Experts have said 11 billion doses are needed to slow the spread of the virus.

288
0:31:23,200 --> 0:31:30,560
So just to give people perspective, as of now, less than half of a percent of all the doses

289
0:31:30,560 --> 0:31:38,800
have been administered in low income countries. So this is not great. So and maybe with that,

290
0:31:38,800 --> 0:31:43,760
I will just go into a reminder. During the months of August, September and October,

291
0:31:44,320 --> 0:31:50,080
please go to parasiteswithoutboarders.com, go to donate. We are going to continue to support

292
0:31:50,080 --> 0:31:57,600
floating doctors who are grouped down in Panama. And as we discussed last week,

293
0:31:57,600 --> 0:32:00,960
they're going to be working with the Ministry. They're going to be getting vaccines out there

294
0:32:01,920 --> 0:32:09,360
really help us because COVID, the COVID pandemic is a global pandemic. And if we don't treat it as

295
0:32:09,360 --> 0:32:15,840
such, we're all at risk. Time for some email questions for Daniel. You can send yours to Daniel

296
0:32:15,840 --> 0:32:24,080
at microbe.tv. John writes, I'm 71. Due to colon cancer, I've lost my spleen, pancreas, half of

297
0:32:24,080 --> 0:32:29,920
one lung and a couple of feet of colon. My health is not great, but my diabetes and blood pressure

298
0:32:29,920 --> 0:32:36,240
are well controlled. I received my second dose of Moderna vaccine in February. Is there a test that

299
0:32:36,240 --> 0:32:41,200
I can request that will show the condition of my immune system? As of now, I don't feel at all

300
0:32:41,200 --> 0:32:46,800
convinced that the vaccine has or will work for me as well as intended. The third dose is available

301
0:32:46,800 --> 0:32:52,240
or soon will be. I will get one if only for additional protection against infection. And yes,

302
0:32:52,240 --> 0:32:58,160
I do understand the difference between infection and disease. I really don't want the infection.

303
0:32:58,160 --> 0:33:02,880
I'm fairly certain that the disease would knock me off my perch. I would really appreciate any

304
0:33:02,880 --> 0:33:07,760
information on available tests that would help me to understand my position. Okay.

305
0:33:09,520 --> 0:33:14,880
So good, good. And I appreciate that you added the sophistication at the end because I think

306
0:33:14,880 --> 0:33:21,280
that sophistication is required. We do not have any great tests for telling how well does the

307
0:33:21,280 --> 0:33:29,120
vaccine work against preventing disease, right, ending up in the hospital death. There is, I'll say

308
0:33:29,120 --> 0:33:35,600
some information supporting the idea that there's a certain correlate between antibody levels and

309
0:33:35,600 --> 0:33:42,640
infection. But I'm going to say that sort of with trepidation, you know, that this is growing,

310
0:33:42,640 --> 0:33:49,200
we're learning about this, you know, I'm going to leave it sort of there. We do not have that

311
0:33:49,200 --> 0:33:53,200
test, I think that you want, you want to go ahead and have a test and have that security.

312
0:33:53,200 --> 0:33:58,480
There's certain ideas that certain levels of antibodies above a certain threshold might be

313
0:33:58,480 --> 0:34:03,360
associated with a lower risk of infection. What am I going to advise you to do? So, you know,

314
0:34:03,360 --> 0:34:07,200
you would probably be an individual as you describe who would qualify for that third shot.

315
0:34:08,160 --> 0:34:12,000
We do not know exactly what that results in, right? We're still waiting for the science as

316
0:34:12,000 --> 0:34:15,840
far as efficacy because you don't want to know what happens to my antibodies. You want to know

317
0:34:15,840 --> 0:34:21,600
what happens to my risk of infection, what happens to my risk of disease. The second thing, you want

318
0:34:21,600 --> 0:34:29,120
to continue to act cautiously. You do not want to have a run-in until we have antivirals, until we

319
0:34:29,120 --> 0:34:35,120
have some other things that are that we can offer. And I mean effective antivirals, not remdesivir,

320
0:34:35,120 --> 0:34:39,840
hopefully a product by Merck or Pfizer that comes out in the next couple months. So continue to

321
0:34:39,840 --> 0:34:45,600
wear masks, continue to make smart decisions. Hopefully individuals like you will have more to offer.

322
0:34:46,880 --> 0:34:51,760
Debbie writes, I'm an internist who has been educating the physicians in our medium-sized

323
0:34:51,760 --> 0:34:56,960
primary care practice since the beginning of the pandemic. As I look to the future of this

324
0:34:56,960 --> 0:35:01,680
virus becoming endemic, I'm trying to think how to frame this and what measures to follow.

325
0:35:01,680 --> 0:35:07,840
It occurs to me that hospital strain, and that's not strain of virus, by the way. That's strain on

326
0:35:07,840 --> 0:35:13,840
the hospital is one of the most important things to follow. In my home state of Texas, our non-medical

327
0:35:13,840 --> 0:35:20,720
governor has decided 15% of beds being occupied by COVID patients was a measure of distress.

328
0:35:20,720 --> 0:35:24,080
I can follow this number on the Johns Hopkins website from my state.

329
0:35:24,080 --> 0:35:28,000
Locally, it's harder to follow. It seems that hospital strain numbers are not universally

330
0:35:28,000 --> 0:35:33,600
agreed upon and also seem to change. Hospitals are used to growing capacity during surges and

331
0:35:33,600 --> 0:35:39,200
emergencies. Is there any agreed upon and standardized measure of hospital strain,

332
0:35:39,200 --> 0:35:45,600
and if so, any reliable website for looking at it? I'm also following the percent positive rate

333
0:35:46,480 --> 0:35:51,040
only as an indication of adequacy of testing and then looking at cases per 100,000

334
0:35:51,040 --> 0:35:59,040
per seven days on the CDC website or globalepidemics.org. Additionally, home testing or very easily

335
0:35:59,040 --> 0:36:04,000
accessible testing is going to have to be a much bigger part of the solution moving forward.

336
0:36:04,000 --> 0:36:09,600
$20 for two tests is too expensive. Here in Texas, it's hard to find home tests.

337
0:36:09,600 --> 0:36:14,720
Scheduled tests are two days out and turnaround times are increasing.

338
0:36:14,720 --> 0:36:23,520
A lot in that email. Talking first about hospital occupancy and how that correlates

339
0:36:23,520 --> 0:36:32,000
with how much a hospital can handle. That's really the number. What is the percent of beds?

340
0:36:32,000 --> 0:36:37,680
What's the hospital capacity? What's the percent of filled beds? The other is actually looking at

341
0:36:37,680 --> 0:36:44,560
ICU, what percent of the beds? In New York, they actually have good sites that you can go to

342
0:36:44,560 --> 0:36:49,760
keep track of that. That's one of the things. Remember, it's not just about COVID. You break

343
0:36:49,760 --> 0:36:56,480
your leg. You're in a car accident. You need chemotherapy. There's a myriad of other reasons

344
0:36:56,480 --> 0:37:03,120
why people end up going to hospital. If those beds are all full of COVID, that's a problem.

345
0:37:03,120 --> 0:37:10,080
That does strain the system. There is a certain ability to deal with increased capacity surges.

346
0:37:10,080 --> 0:37:15,600
We see this a lot of times with influenza, respiratory season. That's helpful.

347
0:37:15,600 --> 0:37:24,400
Testing, yes. As you went through, that was a very sophisticated analysis. If you're in the UK,

348
0:37:24,400 --> 0:37:29,040
you go to a website, and next thing you know, you've got free testing. Here in the US,

349
0:37:29,040 --> 0:37:35,120
$10, $11 per test, that does not encourage people to get tested. If anything, it's pennywise pound

350
0:37:35,120 --> 0:37:41,680
foolish. It is incredibly expensive when someone ends up in the hospital with COVID. It is a lot

351
0:37:41,680 --> 0:37:49,600
cheaper to prevent that. Jamie writes, I am a primary care clinician, a family nurse practitioner

352
0:37:49,600 --> 0:37:56,640
of 19 years with a doctor in translational research. Two clinical questions. One, we're in California

353
0:37:56,640 --> 0:38:02,240
and have vaccine mandates for our public employee sectors. I had my first patient asking for a

354
0:38:02,240 --> 0:38:08,240
medical excuse from the mandate, which as of now can be religious or medical. This 30 something

355
0:38:08,240 --> 0:38:12,240
patient is currently undergoing infertility treatments and wants to wait until after she is

356
0:38:12,240 --> 0:38:17,680
either pregnant or gives birth to get the vaccine. Ask me to put in writing that there are no risks

357
0:38:17,680 --> 0:38:22,640
to pregnancy or fertility treatments, which of course I cannot do. I discussed with her the risks

358
0:38:22,640 --> 0:38:27,440
of COVID while being pregnant and asked her to talk to her reproductive health provider and

359
0:38:27,440 --> 0:38:32,080
come back in two weeks prior to the mandate's effective date so we can make a determination

360
0:38:32,080 --> 0:38:36,320
while I do more research. I wanted to talk to our fellow clinicians and have an office-wide

361
0:38:36,320 --> 0:38:42,560
approach knowing that the only real C.I. to vaccination is allergy to vaccine ingredients.

362
0:38:42,560 --> 0:38:46,880
This person is in a forward-facing public law enforcement position. What would be your guidance

363
0:38:46,880 --> 0:38:52,400
for this case as well as to guide policy protocols knowing there's always some flexibility for

364
0:38:52,400 --> 0:38:59,120
clinicians when we issue protocols here. Yeah, so this is a great question, right? Because

365
0:38:59,120 --> 0:39:05,360
this has been coming up and the patients are angry, right? And the way our healthcare system works.

366
0:39:05,360 --> 0:39:09,680
Like, well, I'm going to find a doctor who or clinician, a provider, basically someone who's

367
0:39:09,680 --> 0:39:18,160
going to sign this. And as this emailer, as you write in, there really are only these two exceptions,

368
0:39:18,160 --> 0:39:25,680
either you have an anaphylactic issue, anaphylactic reaction to this vaccine. You have had an

369
0:39:25,680 --> 0:39:30,640
anaphylactic reaction to that first dose you got, or you have an anaphylactic issue with one of

370
0:39:30,640 --> 0:39:36,160
the components. Well, you're going to have to look at the mRNA, that's going to be the PEG 2000.

371
0:39:36,880 --> 0:39:42,400
Look at J&J, you'll have to see if there's an issue there. But in general, there are very few

372
0:39:42,400 --> 0:39:48,800
individuals, even individuals that have had other allergic issues, most of them can successfully be

373
0:39:48,800 --> 0:39:55,200
vaccinated. What you're being asked is really the wrong question, guaranteeing this person

374
0:39:55,200 --> 0:40:01,200
along healthy life and successful infertility treatments. None of us can do that. The vaccines

375
0:40:01,200 --> 0:40:07,120
are not without risks. You know, this is like them asking for some sort of guarantee that that seat

376
0:40:07,120 --> 0:40:11,760
belt will not cause sternal bruising if they get into an accident. Now, I think what this person

377
0:40:11,760 --> 0:40:17,200
is requesting of you is not reasonable. So what we've tried to do as organizations is just put

378
0:40:17,200 --> 0:40:22,000
in writing, these are the exceptions. And there was a recent call for Northwest, it was an email

379
0:40:22,000 --> 0:40:29,360
that went out by David Battnelli, a really superior clinician and leader. And he basically said to

380
0:40:29,360 --> 0:40:33,840
all the Northwell physicians, these are the exceptions. If you're giving exceptions,

381
0:40:33,840 --> 0:40:39,680
if you're making up reasons for medical exceptions, that's not okay. And that really sounds what

382
0:40:39,680 --> 0:40:44,320
this person is saying. They're saying, please give me a medical exception while I go through

383
0:40:44,320 --> 0:40:47,120
these fertility treatments. That is not in the list of exceptions.

384
0:40:47,120 --> 0:40:54,240
All right. Question number two, more personal on July 4th, my 45 year old otherwise healthy

385
0:40:54,240 --> 0:41:02,000
husband developed chest pain, brought him to the ER. He had elevated D dimer, multiple RPE on CTA,

386
0:41:02,640 --> 0:41:08,320
nodule and the thyroid currently being worked up. He had received a J&J vaccine 10 weeks prior

387
0:41:08,320 --> 0:41:12,960
to this incident and had been feeling fatigued, reported to VAERS and they followed up right

388
0:41:12,960 --> 0:41:18,480
away, but we don't know and may never know if this was a causative factor. So the question is,

389
0:41:18,480 --> 0:41:23,360
should he opt for one of the mRNA injections instead of another J&J?

390
0:41:24,320 --> 0:41:30,080
So sort of hearing this story, it's hard for me to know if there's any connection. It does not

391
0:41:30,080 --> 0:41:37,600
sound in any way compelling for there to be a connection here. But this is that gray of medicine

392
0:41:37,600 --> 0:41:43,360
where we always work where there's no reason not to use an mRNA vaccine in the future.

393
0:41:43,920 --> 0:41:47,920
And I think that's a reasonable choice. But there's nothing you're telling me here that connects

394
0:41:47,920 --> 0:41:52,160
the dots for me and makes me worry that this is J&J related.

395
0:41:52,880 --> 0:41:57,840
All right. One more from Lynn. Just listen to an Andy Slavitt podcast with Johns Hopkins

396
0:41:57,840 --> 0:42:03,600
epidemiologist Jennifer Newzo, very worthwhile discussion of post-vaccination infection.

397
0:42:03,600 --> 0:42:10,080
A note that I don't use the word breakthrough. There was some discussion as well about boosters

398
0:42:10,080 --> 0:42:15,360
and my impression was that global vaccine equity plays too small a role in the booster decision,

399
0:42:15,360 --> 0:42:20,640
but that's not where my two questions for you lie. After the interview was over Slavitt opined

400
0:42:20,640 --> 0:42:26,000
on several COVID related matters. He did a good job explaining waning, neutralizing antibodies

401
0:42:26,000 --> 0:42:31,040
and memory T cells responding to viral attack. He then went on to say that the memory B cell

402
0:42:31,040 --> 0:42:35,760
and T cell response is slower to appear. And that could lead to symptoms and disease

403
0:42:35,760 --> 0:42:40,720
before full immune response kicks in. His argument for boosters is that those antibodies that appear

404
0:42:40,720 --> 0:42:45,520
directly after a boost will afford more protection against symptoms and disease. If you're dead set

405
0:42:45,520 --> 0:42:51,920
against symptoms, then a booster is your thing. Is this correct? To his credit, Slavitt gives a

406
0:42:51,920 --> 0:42:56,720
very well articulated discussion on the pros and cons politically and medically of boosters.

407
0:42:56,720 --> 0:43:00,720
He feels that boosters, the immunocompromised, vulnerable elderly and healthcare workers in the

408
0:43:00,720 --> 0:43:06,720
U.S. is fair. Boosting everyone else before the rest of the world has vaccine access is not.

409
0:43:06,720 --> 0:43:12,960
All right, let's do that one first. Okay, so first I'm going to say, Jennifer Newzo,

410
0:43:12,960 --> 0:43:19,440
she's fantastic, right? And everything Jennifer says, I remember, I actually listened to that

411
0:43:19,440 --> 0:43:26,240
podcast. And everything Jennifer says, I'm going to, I'm going to sort of thumbs up. She really gives

412
0:43:26,240 --> 0:43:33,920
an ex expert scientific basis to what she has to say. Now I love Andy. Andy actually is an

413
0:43:33,920 --> 0:43:40,080
old Optum executive, right? So he did a great job helping with the vaccine rollout. But I worry

414
0:43:40,080 --> 0:43:45,840
about Andy is he's very articulate. He's very charismatic. He's very persuasive. He's not a doctor.

415
0:43:45,840 --> 0:43:53,280
And so I often feel like he oversteps, right? So, you know, it's actually interesting if you

416
0:43:53,280 --> 0:43:59,920
go back and listen to sort of his older podcasts and watches it evolves. Yeah, so I actually listen

417
0:43:59,920 --> 0:44:05,840
to his podcast. He does a great job. But everything Andy says, take it with a grain of salt. He's a

418
0:44:05,840 --> 0:44:11,360
great logistics guy. He's the guy you call if you want help, maybe using PEPFAR to get those

419
0:44:11,360 --> 0:44:16,320
vaccines out there. But if you want good science, if you want good medical advice,

420
0:44:17,040 --> 0:44:22,480
listen to his guests. So I would say if you have can only listen to one podcast, listen to

421
0:44:22,480 --> 0:44:28,160
Twiv, not Slavitt. Yes. All right. Second question, Slavitt said that smarter people

422
0:44:28,160 --> 0:44:34,080
than he are pushing for the J and J vaccinated to get an mRNA vaccine. Where's the data that

423
0:44:34,080 --> 0:44:40,160
supports this? And would it be one dose or two? Yeah, I remember when he made that comment and,

424
0:44:40,160 --> 0:44:45,120
you know, sort of say, he talked to a whole bunch of really smart people. And yeah, you know,

425
0:44:45,120 --> 0:44:50,880
again, Andy Slavitt, he's charismatic. He's a great public speaker. But yeah, take it with

426
0:44:50,880 --> 0:44:54,560
grain of salt. There's no science that supports that recommendation. I don't know who these smart

427
0:44:54,560 --> 0:45:00,480
people are. By the way, Lynn has written into Twiv. She is the retired molecular biologist from

428
0:45:00,480 --> 0:45:07,680
Western Massachusetts and grandmother to the epitope obsessed grandson. Oh, I love that.

429
0:45:07,680 --> 0:45:14,880
Isn't that great? That's COVID-19 clinical update number 79 with Dr. Daniel Griffin.

430
0:45:14,880 --> 0:45:44,720
Thank you, Daniel. Oh, thank you. And everyone, including events in BC.
