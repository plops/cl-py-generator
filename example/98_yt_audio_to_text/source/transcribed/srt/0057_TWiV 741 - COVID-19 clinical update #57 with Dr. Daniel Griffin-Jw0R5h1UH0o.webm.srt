0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:06,960
This week in virology, the podcast about viruses, the kind that make you sick.

2
0:00:10,400 --> 0:00:21,280
From Microbe TV, this is Twiv. This week in virology, episode 741 recorded on April 8th, 2021.

3
0:00:21,280 --> 0:00:27,120
I'm Vincent Rackeniello, and you're listening to the podcast all about viruses. Joining me today

4
0:00:27,120 --> 0:00:36,320
from New York, Daniel Griffin. Hello, everyone. That's right, Daniel. This is update number 57,

5
0:00:36,320 --> 0:00:42,800
and how are things going this week? They are a little bit better, but what

6
0:00:42,800 --> 0:00:46,480
Twiver are you at? What Twiver are we up to Vincent to say there? 741.

7
0:00:47,440 --> 0:00:53,360
741, okay. I'm looking for the 747, like, because that's the big one with the upper deck.

8
0:00:53,360 --> 0:01:00,960
Then after that, there's a 777, right? And then the 787. We'll go through all those. Don't worry.

9
0:01:03,440 --> 0:01:07,200
All right, let me start with my quotation, and then I will give the update on where we are.

10
0:01:08,080 --> 0:01:12,880
So this is be kind for everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle.

11
0:01:13,840 --> 0:01:22,800
And this is actually from Philo of Alexandria, 20 BCE to 20 CE. So this goes back away, but I

12
0:01:22,800 --> 0:01:29,760
think maybe we need to remember. We've come out of this pandemic, and a lot of ways worse,

13
0:01:29,760 --> 0:01:35,760
a lot of ways divided, hostile. Sometimes I feel like I'm in a Monty Python movie,

14
0:01:35,760 --> 0:01:41,600
and someone sees their neighbors, they run away because this actually developed what I'm going to

15
0:01:41,600 --> 0:01:48,160
point. The fear of normal, phone know. A lot of us are pretty traumatized from this last year,

16
0:01:48,160 --> 0:01:53,280
so I deal if we can all start working together. We are on the same side relative to the virus.

17
0:01:54,240 --> 0:02:00,320
So my three quotations, as always, never miss an opportunity to vaccinate, never miss an

18
0:02:00,320 --> 0:02:06,640
opportunity to test, and never waste a vaccine dose. Let's get those vaccines into arms. The

19
0:02:06,640 --> 0:02:12,720
fridges and freezers do not need the vaccines people do. Where are we right now? What's sort of

20
0:02:12,720 --> 0:02:18,800
the update? Worldwide, I don't often mention this, but worldwide, let's look, where are we

21
0:02:18,800 --> 0:02:26,080
looking? The world picture worldwide, the case numbers and deaths are rising. With over a half

22
0:02:26,080 --> 0:02:32,320
a million new cases per day, it's probably more, but that's what we're hearing, over 10,000 deaths

23
0:02:32,320 --> 0:02:41,280
per day, again, probably higher. This is certainly not over. What about here in the US? I like to

24
0:02:41,280 --> 0:02:47,360
think that the experience in Israel is encouraging. They're ahead of us. The experience in the UK

25
0:02:47,360 --> 0:02:51,760
is encouraging. They're also ahead of us. The US, hopefully we're going to be next in line,

26
0:02:51,760 --> 0:02:57,440
sort of a beacon of what happens with vaccinations, but we are still on this plateau here in the US.

27
0:02:58,960 --> 0:03:05,920
Thanks, mainly to a few states. I call you out. Everyone in Michigan, Florida, New York, New Jersey,

28
0:03:05,920 --> 0:03:11,760
and Pennsylvania, we're still seeing lots of cases, high positivity rates at these places.

29
0:03:11,760 --> 0:03:16,880
Now, Georgia, oddly enough, is not reporting a lot of cases. They're not in the top 10s

30
0:03:16,880 --> 0:03:23,120
in terms of cases, but they are in the top three in terms of daily deaths. I say that a little

31
0:03:23,120 --> 0:03:28,000
tongue in cheek, but there certainly are some issues with not doing enough tests around the

32
0:03:28,000 --> 0:03:34,080
country, particularly in certain places. You can't hide the deaths. I guess you probably could,

33
0:03:34,080 --> 0:03:39,040
as we learned, but when you see those deaths, it really suggests that we're not capturing all

34
0:03:39,040 --> 0:03:45,280
those cases. I did want to point out, isn't the CDC in Georgia? It means you'd be doing a better

35
0:03:45,280 --> 0:03:52,640
job of testing, tracking, and everything else. Across the US, we have less testing, but we still

36
0:03:52,640 --> 0:04:00,560
have the same number of new cases each day. I'm not sure that this is as low a plateau as people

37
0:04:00,560 --> 0:04:06,640
might think. The same number of people are in the hospital across the board, certainly here in

38
0:04:06,640 --> 0:04:12,960
New York since February. There are fewer deaths per day. It's odd that we're celebrating that we're

39
0:04:12,960 --> 0:04:18,640
under 1,000, that we're still seeing 600, 800, 800 a day. That's pretty high plateau.

40
0:04:19,600 --> 0:04:25,520
Things that have changed is the age of the patients in the hospital, and the age of those testing

41
0:04:25,520 --> 0:04:30,080
positive on average is decreased. That's something that's being reported. That's certainly something

42
0:04:30,080 --> 0:04:35,680
we're seeing in our, we still do a tremendous amount of testing here in the tri-state area

43
0:04:35,680 --> 0:04:41,200
at pro health and opt-in tri-state. That's my update, but now let's get into children and COVID.

44
0:04:41,200 --> 0:04:46,000
This is always a hot topic. We've covered that full in-person learning can be done

45
0:04:46,000 --> 0:04:52,160
safely. Now, we have guidance from the CDC, but I'm getting lots of questions about how do we

46
0:04:52,160 --> 0:04:58,480
actually guarantee that this is done safely and not just done? This is interesting.

47
0:04:58,480 --> 0:05:04,160
So I'm going to throw in, and this is sort of thrown out of phase order, but it's in the children

48
0:05:04,160 --> 0:05:12,480
topic. We got some updates about the multi-system inflammatory syndrome during the COVID-19 pandemic

49
0:05:12,480 --> 0:05:20,000
in children. So what I like to point out is that children certainly are at low, lower risk than

50
0:05:20,000 --> 0:05:26,240
adults, but they are not at no risk. So let's put some context here. So in JAMA pediatrics,

51
0:05:26,240 --> 0:05:32,400
the article trends in geographic and temporal distribution of US children with multi-system

52
0:05:32,400 --> 0:05:39,280
inflammatory syndrome during the COVID-19 pandemic was published. This was a cross-sectional study

53
0:05:39,280 --> 0:05:47,040
of 1,733 patients with multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children. So the miss C.

54
0:05:47,840 --> 0:05:54,640
And the analysis included patients with illness onset from March 2020 to January 2021 that

55
0:05:54,640 --> 0:05:59,600
met the miss C case definition. Patients with Miss C predominately presented with

56
0:06:00,160 --> 0:06:06,480
gastrointestinal symptoms, such as abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhea, as well as skin rash

57
0:06:06,480 --> 0:06:13,040
and conjunctival hyperremia. So that's a redness to the eyes, to the whites of the eyes.

58
0:06:13,040 --> 0:06:20,400
Most patients developed hypotension or shock with about 60% overall being admitted to the

59
0:06:20,400 --> 0:06:25,840
intensive care unit. And I think I've mentioned that this went from early on being less to 50%

60
0:06:26,400 --> 0:06:33,680
to later on at being 80, 90%. So sort of evolving numbers. Myocarditis, so inflammation of the heart

61
0:06:33,680 --> 0:06:39,840
muscle, cardiac dysfunction, and coronary artery dilation. So these are the blood vessels that

62
0:06:39,840 --> 0:06:44,880
wrap around the heart actually dilating. That was reported in about a third of patients.

63
0:06:44,880 --> 0:06:50,960
Now, most miss C illness are believed to result from asymptomatic or mild COVID-19.

64
0:06:51,920 --> 0:06:56,400
I think sort of want to reinforce that asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 upfront.

65
0:06:57,200 --> 0:07:03,520
With hyper inflammation coinciding with peak antibody production, several weeks after that

66
0:07:03,520 --> 0:07:10,560
initial SARS-CoV-2 infections. So patients with Miss C were reported to have significantly

67
0:07:10,560 --> 0:07:17,280
higher titers of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain IgG-80 bodies compared with

68
0:07:17,280 --> 0:07:23,920
other patients hospitalized with COVID-19. So just sort of an update. This is out there.

69
0:07:23,920 --> 0:07:28,480
We're getting more information on it. But let's talk a little bit about the school opening plans.

70
0:07:28,480 --> 0:07:34,640
I was getting a lot of texts and messages about one of the local school districts that is

71
0:07:34,640 --> 0:07:38,800
planning an opening. And they started laying out their guidelines, they're going to separate

72
0:07:38,800 --> 0:07:43,440
the desk by three feet. The children are going to be wearing masks at all times.

73
0:07:43,440 --> 0:07:48,000
They're actually going to have these plexiglass dividers. So I'm hearing all this, this sounds

74
0:07:48,000 --> 0:07:54,960
encouraging, upgrading of the ventilation system. But then I had a very interesting quarantine

75
0:07:54,960 --> 0:07:59,120
outline. And what they were saying was that, okay, we're putting all these things in place.

76
0:07:59,120 --> 0:08:05,680
But if a child tests positive, anyone within three feet of them, so the desks within three

77
0:08:05,680 --> 0:08:10,800
of them, they will all be quarantined. And since this school is one where the children go to

78
0:08:10,800 --> 0:08:16,880
different classrooms, that one sort of index positive case will then affect, I guess you could do the

79
0:08:16,880 --> 0:08:21,920
math on this, right? Like three in front, three behind and one on each side. So eight kids from

80
0:08:21,920 --> 0:08:27,200
each class will be quarantined for the required quarantine period. And some of the questions the

81
0:08:27,200 --> 0:08:32,480
parents were asking, well, if it's safe to be within three feet with all this mitigation,

82
0:08:32,480 --> 0:08:38,160
then why are these kids going into quarantine? If our kids are going to actually have exposures

83
0:08:38,160 --> 0:08:43,760
in school, you know, and it's sort of a back and forth. And I think that one of the things that

84
0:08:43,760 --> 0:08:48,880
may be missing here for a lot of the schools is they're being asked to open, but they don't

85
0:08:48,880 --> 0:08:52,960
necessarily have the professional guidance to help them put the whole plan together.

86
0:08:53,680 --> 0:08:59,440
I think this has come up many times. If you do not have an exposure, you do not need to quarantine.

87
0:08:59,440 --> 0:09:03,760
And if you're setting up a school plan that's going to actually provide exposure opportunities

88
0:09:03,760 --> 0:09:08,560
for the children, that's not a great school opening plan. So, you know, reach out. If you

89
0:09:08,560 --> 0:09:12,720
don't have the expertise, if you don't know how to do this, a lot of people don't have expertise.

90
0:09:12,720 --> 0:09:17,440
I mean, a superintendent, a principal, a teacher, I don't want to be the one, you know, teaching your

91
0:09:17,440 --> 0:09:21,760
high schoolers or your middle schoolers. You probably don't want to be the one coming up with

92
0:09:21,760 --> 0:09:27,200
school reopening plans during a pandemic without some communication. So I throw that out there. I

93
0:09:27,200 --> 0:09:34,000
do think that we can open schools safely, but you have to have the understanding and the science

94
0:09:34,000 --> 0:09:39,280
to do this. And this ties directly into transmission. And today we're going to talk a lot about

95
0:09:39,280 --> 0:09:45,600
transmission. So much about COVID-19 has been controversial and either content and even

96
0:09:45,600 --> 0:09:50,880
contentious. So remember my quotation? We're all in this together. The virus is the enemy,

97
0:09:50,880 --> 0:09:55,840
not your neighbor. And I guess I shouldn't be surprised. I still remember it was during my

98
0:09:55,840 --> 0:10:00,400
graduate training when, you know, it almost came to fisticuffs. You know, I was having a dispute with

99
0:10:00,400 --> 0:10:05,600
with another one of the graduate students about whether or not NF Kappa B activation was essential

100
0:10:05,600 --> 0:10:12,240
for TH 17 differentiation. Really? Really? That was enough to get like an overheated argument?

101
0:10:13,200 --> 0:10:18,240
Here, we're actually talking about something that affects people's lives. And, you know,

102
0:10:18,240 --> 0:10:25,600
this is a scientific question. And I think we need to be level headed when we discuss

103
0:10:25,600 --> 0:10:30,240
what do we know about this so that we can make appropriate decisions to protect everyone.

104
0:10:31,200 --> 0:10:36,880
I mean, I think one of the issues, I will say, the issue of transmission was complicated by

105
0:10:36,880 --> 0:10:42,880
terms of art. There are certain words that we use in science. There's certain words that we use

106
0:10:42,880 --> 0:10:49,520
even slightly differently in the clinical arena, terms of art, such as airborne. And there are

107
0:10:49,520 --> 0:10:55,440
common usage of these terms by the general public. So a lot of times we would ask that question,

108
0:10:55,440 --> 0:11:00,160
you know, is this airborne? I remember a wonderful article. It may not be airborne,

109
0:11:00,160 --> 0:11:04,960
but it's borne by the air, right? I mean, so there was a lot of confusion, like what is happening

110
0:11:04,960 --> 0:11:12,400
here? So in the open forum, infectious disease journal, the article SARS-CoV-2 infection among

111
0:11:12,400 --> 0:11:18,160
healthcare workers, despite the use of surgical masks and physical distancing, the role of airborne

112
0:11:18,160 --> 0:11:23,760
transmission was published by a group out of Israel. So this was a case study where the authors

113
0:11:23,760 --> 0:11:30,400
described a single source outbreak of COVID-19 from an asymptomatic patient to nine healthcare

114
0:11:30,400 --> 0:11:36,480
workers and room contacts in a general pediatric ward, despite meeting the current guidelines for

115
0:11:36,480 --> 0:11:43,040
PPE and the wearing of surgical masks. Now, due to confirmation bias, I actually worry about this

116
0:11:43,040 --> 0:11:48,080
article. I think it's going to be embraced by sort of both sides of this controversy right back

117
0:11:48,080 --> 0:11:53,840
to sides again. So I'm going to take a moment here and we're going to have to learn to be a

118
0:11:53,840 --> 0:11:58,320
little painful, but we're going to do a little vocabulary here. But I think this is critical.

119
0:11:58,320 --> 0:12:02,640
This is important. This is how we keep ourselves safe. And I think understanding these terms are

120
0:12:02,640 --> 0:12:09,040
important. So the first term, respiratory droplets. These are small drops or portions of liquid

121
0:12:09,840 --> 0:12:16,720
that are in the five to 10 micron range. These are expelled when a person coughs, sneezes,

122
0:12:16,720 --> 0:12:22,480
sigs, or as we now know, I think is more generally appreciated, talking as well. People always

123
0:12:22,480 --> 0:12:26,000
think about this. Well, you're not coughing, you're not sneezing. If you're not sick, how are you

124
0:12:26,000 --> 0:12:35,120
spreading this? Just talking is creating these droplets. That's why a person can be pre-symptomatic

125
0:12:35,120 --> 0:12:41,600
and still create them. You do not need to be coughing, sneezing. Droplet nuclei or aerosols,

126
0:12:41,600 --> 0:12:46,880
right? Now, we're talking about a term of art. These are small drops that are less than five

127
0:12:46,880 --> 0:12:53,920
microns. And due to their small size, they can actually remain airborne for extended periods of

128
0:12:53,920 --> 0:13:01,040
time and transmit over significant distances. Then we have follomites and these are contaminated

129
0:13:01,040 --> 0:13:09,040
surfaces. So what about airborne transmission? Now, the CDC points out that this is a specialized

130
0:13:09,040 --> 0:13:15,920
use word in medicine and public health and is used to describe infections capable of being

131
0:13:15,920 --> 0:13:22,640
transmitted through exposure to infections, pathogen containing small droplets, and particles

132
0:13:22,640 --> 0:13:27,760
suspended in the air over long distances that persist in the air for long times.

133
0:13:28,720 --> 0:13:33,200
And where are we with all this? I just showed you an article, oh my gosh, with an instance of

134
0:13:33,200 --> 0:13:39,840
airborne transmission, despite masks. So as per the CDC, the principal mode by which people are

135
0:13:39,840 --> 0:13:46,240
infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is through exposure to respiratory

136
0:13:46,240 --> 0:13:54,160
droplets carrying infectious virus. They do go on to say airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2

137
0:13:54,160 --> 0:14:00,080
can occur under special circumstances. And those with a special circumstances that we

138
0:14:00,080 --> 0:14:06,720
describe. So what are those special circumstances? Enclosed spaces, right? We keep harping on

139
0:14:06,720 --> 0:14:12,880
indoor versus outdoor. Enclosed spaces within which an infectious person either exposed

140
0:14:12,880 --> 0:14:17,600
susceptible people at the same time or to which susceptible people were exposed shortly after

141
0:14:17,600 --> 0:14:25,040
the infectious person had left that space. So that indoor poor air circulation, prolonged exposure

142
0:14:25,040 --> 0:14:31,920
to respiratory particles. Remember, this is a continuum. There's no plexiglass sort of shield

143
0:14:31,920 --> 0:14:39,520
at this distinction between the different micron sizes. So shouting, singing, exercising,

144
0:14:39,520 --> 0:14:44,960
you're actually going to increase the concentration of suspended respiratory droplets in the airspace.

145
0:14:44,960 --> 0:14:50,480
So prolonged exposure. And then inadequate ventilation, which all this is all tied together,

146
0:14:50,480 --> 0:14:56,400
or poor handling. So you're allowing a buildup of suspended small respiratory droplets and

147
0:14:56,400 --> 0:15:02,960
particles. So that's your suburban home without good air exchanges. So I think that we can very

148
0:15:02,960 --> 0:15:09,920
clearly at this point say that the CDC, the WHO, and the science supports that the principal mode

149
0:15:09,920 --> 0:15:16,160
here is respiratory droplets. Airborne transmission is rare, but can happen in

150
0:15:16,160 --> 0:15:23,440
circumstances. And fomites contact. I think the current CDC estimate is that maybe one in every

151
0:15:23,440 --> 0:15:31,520
10,000 infection was due to surfaces. So just rethink all that bleach and chlorox and everything

152
0:15:31,520 --> 0:15:39,520
else. So on April, on April 5th, so Monday, April 5th, the CDC published an updated science brief

153
0:15:39,520 --> 0:15:46,160
addressing fomite transmission. And this was titled SARS-CoV-2 and surface fomite transmission

154
0:15:46,160 --> 0:15:52,800
for indoor community environments. And I'm sorry to the makers of bleach, but this goes along the

155
0:15:52,800 --> 0:15:57,600
lines of what we've been discussing. But instead of focusing on the distinction in respiratory

156
0:15:57,600 --> 0:16:04,560
droplets and aerosols, it focuses on getting COVID-19. So getting that virus and developing

157
0:16:04,560 --> 0:16:09,840
COVID-19 from surfaces and the summary statement, the principal mode by which people are infected

158
0:16:09,840 --> 0:16:16,160
with SARS-CoV-2 is through exposure to respiratory droplets. It is possible for people to be infected

159
0:16:16,160 --> 0:16:21,360
through contact with contaminated surfaces or objects, fomites, but the risk is generally

160
0:16:21,360 --> 0:16:27,200
considered to be low. So this doesn't mean we're walking around with unclean hands. I still want

161
0:16:27,200 --> 0:16:35,040
people to wash their hands. But I think there has been a lot of resources put into hygiene theater.

162
0:16:35,600 --> 0:16:40,400
And they actually conclude in the statement that in most situations, cleaning surfaces using soap

163
0:16:40,400 --> 0:16:47,760
or detergent and not requiring this disinfection is enough to reduce the risk testing. The journal

164
0:16:47,760 --> 0:16:54,480
of clinical microbiology published a nice meta analysis performance of saliva, oral pharyngeal

165
0:16:54,480 --> 0:17:02,880
swabs and nasal swabs for SARS-CoV-2, molecular detection, a systematic review and meta analysis.

166
0:17:02,880 --> 0:17:08,800
Now, for starters, what is a meta analysis? So in the edited words of Mark Chris Lap,

167
0:17:08,800 --> 0:17:14,480
Perciflagger's infectious disease, Puskass Fade, this is when you pile a whole bunch of studies

168
0:17:14,480 --> 0:17:21,760
on top of each other and they suddenly turn into gold. I think Mark will be turning over in his

169
0:17:21,760 --> 0:17:26,480
grave even though he's still alive. It just has decided to stop Puskassing. So he's only died in a

170
0:17:26,480 --> 0:17:33,280
certain way. But this was really a high-level summary where they looked through. They found

171
0:17:33,280 --> 0:17:44,400
1,253 unique citations. They then drilled down to identify 25 saliva studies, 11 nasal swabs,

172
0:17:44,400 --> 0:17:51,680
6 oral pharyngeal and 4 oral pharyngeal nasal swab studies. So from all the different

173
0:17:51,680 --> 0:17:57,360
sources, what they were using is nasal pharyngeal swabs of the gold standard and saying if we do

174
0:17:57,360 --> 0:18:03,440
other methods, how much of the time are we able to pick that up? And so they basically came down with

175
0:18:04,320 --> 0:18:12,000
the nasal swabs. We're picking up about 82%. The oral pharyngeal, we're picking up about 84%

176
0:18:12,000 --> 0:18:18,080
and the saliva, we're picking up about 88% of those that were picked up with the nasal pharyngeal

177
0:18:18,080 --> 0:18:24,400
swabs. They also reported a few things that I found interesting. They reported finding several

178
0:18:24,400 --> 0:18:32,000
studies that the unsupervised, self-collected nasal swab specimens had higher percent positives

179
0:18:32,000 --> 0:18:37,760
compared to those collected by healthcare workers. So I was trying to analyze this. Is this that

180
0:18:37,760 --> 0:18:42,960
healthcare workers are too gentle? Is it that when no one's watching, people are willing to get a

181
0:18:42,960 --> 0:18:48,640
much better, deeper sample. So you turn away and tell them to go at it. I also thought it was

182
0:18:48,640 --> 0:18:53,360
interesting. A lot of times we have people hold a mask and they cough and they try to get up this

183
0:18:53,360 --> 0:18:58,800
deep throat saliva and we tell them you can't eat, you can't drink, you can't brush your teeth.

184
0:19:00,160 --> 0:19:05,920
That really didn't seem to do much in terms of sensitivity. So maybe it's a little nicer. People

185
0:19:05,920 --> 0:19:12,480
can show up for their testing with brushed teeth and having some adequate hydration. There were a

186
0:19:12,480 --> 0:19:17,360
number of limitations though I thought in this study. And my big one, and I think all the listeners

187
0:19:17,360 --> 0:19:22,800
will guess at it, was where are the CT values? And I think we've learned over the last year that

188
0:19:22,800 --> 0:19:29,040
nasal pharyngeal swabs are very sensitive, but sometimes maybe are they too sensitive to answer

189
0:19:29,040 --> 0:19:36,320
certain questions. So if saliva, for instance, is missing these low-level RNA PCR positives,

190
0:19:36,960 --> 0:19:42,960
weeks after the acute infection, do we really care? Is that really a limitation? Is this really

191
0:19:42,960 --> 0:19:48,560
relevant if we're testing to avoid transmissions such as might be done for certain sporting programs

192
0:19:48,560 --> 0:19:55,280
or now we know New York working with Mount Sinai is going to develop this large-scale saliva

193
0:19:55,280 --> 0:20:03,280
testing availability for opening large venue events. If those people have a few thousand

194
0:20:03,280 --> 0:20:09,440
bits of RNA, am I concerned as someone going into a venue, particularly as a vaccinated person

195
0:20:09,440 --> 0:20:16,320
going into a venue, versus someone who has a high positivity, such a large amount of RNA that's

196
0:20:16,320 --> 0:20:21,680
being picked up by antigen tests and all these others? So I think we have a lot of good testing

197
0:20:21,680 --> 0:20:27,280
options and we just need to ask what question are we answering or asking when we do these tests?

198
0:20:27,280 --> 0:20:34,400
Active vaccination. There does seem to be some growing evidence that there may be an actual

199
0:20:34,400 --> 0:20:41,680
connection between the blood clotting and the platelet disorder and the AstraZeneca vaccine.

200
0:20:41,680 --> 0:20:51,040
I used a lot of qualifications in there. It still appears that the incidence of this clotting and

201
0:20:51,040 --> 0:20:58,560
platelet complication is rare and the risk of a COVID complication in most cases is significantly

202
0:20:58,560 --> 0:21:06,320
higher if you remain unvaccinated. But this is evolving. The Medicines Health Care Products

203
0:21:06,320 --> 0:21:13,440
Regulatory Agency, that's the MHRA, they regulate medicines, medicinal devices, blood components for

204
0:21:13,440 --> 0:21:23,680
transfusion in the UK. They recorded 30 cases in 18 million vaccinated individuals. So we're

205
0:21:23,680 --> 0:21:31,200
looking at a complication rate of one in 600,000, but there have been seven deaths. There may be

206
0:21:31,200 --> 0:21:37,360
an issue with the age skewing. This may be something that is clustered more in younger individuals.

207
0:21:37,360 --> 0:21:43,760
And so we're actually certainly seeing some changes where there's a preferential use of this

208
0:21:43,760 --> 0:21:49,440
vaccine in older individuals and a preferential use of other vaccines in younger individuals.

209
0:21:49,440 --> 0:21:54,480
So this is an evolving story. And as we learn more, we're going to have to decide what to do

210
0:21:54,480 --> 0:22:00,400
here with this information. Just an update on the Pfizer EUA expansion, right? Let's get vaccines

211
0:22:00,400 --> 0:22:08,480
to younger individuals or the option to have vaccines in younger 12, 13, 14, 15. And as far as

212
0:22:08,480 --> 0:22:15,680
timing, right? We heard about the data. There is a required 15-day notice of intent to submit

213
0:22:15,680 --> 0:22:22,720
before the FDA performs their review. So Paul Offit, who's a member of the Vaccines and Related

214
0:22:22,720 --> 0:22:28,640
Biological Products Advisory Committee, just was saying the other day that so far that notice has

215
0:22:28,640 --> 0:22:35,040
not been given. So, you know, whether it's later this month, I think it's going to be May at the

216
0:22:35,040 --> 0:22:42,320
earliest that we see a potential e-way expansion down to our kids, 12, 13, 14, and 15. Passive

217
0:22:42,320 --> 0:22:48,480
vaccination, right? The monoclonals. This seems to be going much better as far as getting these

218
0:22:48,480 --> 0:22:54,000
off the shelves and to the patients. I think seeing the phase three data, all the help that

219
0:22:54,000 --> 0:22:59,440
we've gotten from a lot of individuals to get the word out has helped. I have to say, on our last

220
0:23:00,000 --> 0:23:05,600
tri-state urgent care call, this week the comment was that our whole book and infusion center was

221
0:23:05,600 --> 0:23:09,920
basically getting fully booked. And we're all questions about how much capacity did we have

222
0:23:10,480 --> 0:23:16,800
for our in-home infusion program. So people are really getting out and they're getting these

223
0:23:16,800 --> 0:23:22,560
treatments. And I have to say this is tremendous. When we see these individuals' experience we have

224
0:23:22,560 --> 0:23:28,320
is they get the infusion. And 36 hours later, they're really reporting sort of that Superman

225
0:23:28,320 --> 0:23:34,000
feeling. I actually spent some time recently over at one of the Catholic hospitals in our area,

226
0:23:34,000 --> 0:23:39,520
St. Francis Hospital, speaking with Stefan Moldauer, he's the head of the ER there,

227
0:23:39,520 --> 0:23:44,800
just making sure we have everything firing as smoothly as we can on all cylinders.

228
0:23:45,760 --> 0:23:51,280
Now, if I got that expression, correct. But right, we have the ability with monoclonals

229
0:23:51,280 --> 0:23:57,520
to either go to outpatient infusion centers, to go to certain ERs, to go to certain infusion tents

230
0:23:57,520 --> 0:24:03,280
that are set up outside of ERs, and to get even in-home infusions. And this seems to all be going

231
0:24:03,280 --> 0:24:08,480
very smoothly with getting people access to the monoclonal cocktails. Some exciting developments

232
0:24:08,480 --> 0:24:15,600
before we move forward. Right now, as mentioned, that's great and all, but this is putting an IV in.

233
0:24:15,600 --> 0:24:20,320
It's a, well, 21 minutes we're allowed to, but a lot of centers are spending a full hour of the

234
0:24:20,320 --> 0:24:26,880
infusion, plus a post-infusion observation time. V-R-G-S-K, which is trying to get their product

235
0:24:26,880 --> 0:24:34,640
EUA, is also looking at expanding into an IM, an intra-muscular preparation. So right now,

236
0:24:34,640 --> 0:24:40,720
they have Comet Peak, which is an ongoing phase two trial. And they're really looking at safety,

237
0:24:40,720 --> 0:24:49,760
viral kinetics, pharmacodynamics, doing this as an IM, but they're about to fire up Comet tail.

238
0:24:49,760 --> 0:24:55,600
And this will be a phase three trial, which is going to be starting in the next month or so,

239
0:24:55,600 --> 0:25:02,800
and will be administering these IM products to high-risk adults, showing hopefully the same benefit

240
0:25:02,800 --> 0:25:07,680
for reducing hospitalizations and deaths. But you can imagine the improved access. You getting

241
0:25:07,680 --> 0:25:14,080
something like an EpiPen, where it can be just delivered from your local pharmacy, or maybe it's

242
0:25:14,080 --> 0:25:20,960
what's brought in by an infusion team, or a home care team, and boom, just right into the muscle.

243
0:25:20,960 --> 0:25:24,000
We'll talk about whether or not you need to withdraw that plunger when you do that,

244
0:25:24,560 --> 0:25:29,520
and then going ahead with the treatment. Incubation, post-exposure period. Remember,

245
0:25:29,520 --> 0:25:35,840
tests do not predict the future. I was on a call last night with a cab. And yeah, you got to keep

246
0:25:35,840 --> 0:25:41,760
saying that. I use the pregnancy test analogy. Once someone is exposed, there's a period of time

247
0:25:41,760 --> 0:25:46,800
when they can go on to become positive. If someone gets exposed, they immediately test,

248
0:25:46,800 --> 0:25:51,840
it's probably going to be negative. But that does not mean that they will not go on and become

249
0:25:51,840 --> 0:25:58,880
positive in the next two to 14 days. Once they get into that period of detectable viral replication,

250
0:25:58,880 --> 0:26:06,000
remember our passive monoclonals, our passive vaccination. So time for monoclonals and monitoring,

251
0:26:06,000 --> 0:26:12,720
no steroids, no antibiotics in that first week. If you do get into that early inflammatory phase,

252
0:26:12,720 --> 0:26:19,360
second week, if the oxygen saturation is drop below 94, then you think of steroids, oxygen,

253
0:26:19,360 --> 0:26:25,360
anticoagulation, perhaps from decivir. Most of these folks are not coming in with infections.

254
0:26:25,360 --> 0:26:31,120
That is a later stage issue. And we got a lot of information. I'm going to say close on this,

255
0:26:31,120 --> 0:26:34,320
but this is actually a big chunk. We're going to talk what we've learned about

256
0:26:34,320 --> 0:26:43,200
about tail phase and long COVID. So in the BMJ, we saw the article post COVID syndrome in individuals

257
0:26:43,200 --> 0:26:50,720
admitted to hospital with COVID-19 retrospective cohort study. So in this observational retrospective

258
0:26:50,720 --> 0:26:59,520
matched cohort study, they reported on the outcomes with a mean of 140 days for 47,780

259
0:26:59,520 --> 0:27:06,160
individuals that had been admitted to the NHS hospitals in England for COVID-19 and had been

260
0:27:06,160 --> 0:27:11,760
discharged alive, right? So these are the individuals that got almost 50,000 that got COVID were in

261
0:27:11,760 --> 0:27:18,800
the hospital. Nearly one third were readmitted and more than 10% died during this follow-up.

262
0:27:18,800 --> 0:27:23,520
Those with COVID-19 were diagnosed with major adverse cardiovascular events,

263
0:27:23,520 --> 0:27:30,160
liver disease, kidney disease, diabetes, after discharge, what were the rates?

264
0:27:30,160 --> 0:27:39,040
Respectively, 3, 2.8, 1.9, and 1.5 times more. So major cardiovascular, three times more likely,

265
0:27:39,040 --> 0:27:44,640
liver disease, almost three times more likely, kidney disease, twice as likely,

266
0:27:44,640 --> 0:27:51,440
diabetes 1.5 times more frequently than in the matched control group. This is a bit of an issue,

267
0:27:51,440 --> 0:27:58,720
right? I'm looking forward to more data on this, but we also had another study, and I think this

268
0:27:58,720 --> 0:28:04,560
is getting a lot of attention. And this was in the Lancet Psychiatry Journal, and this paper,

269
0:28:04,560 --> 0:28:15,360
6-month neurological and psychiatric outcomes in 236,379 survivors of COVID-19, a retrospective

270
0:28:15,360 --> 0:28:22,400
cohort study using electronic health records. So this is really robust data, right? You know,

271
0:28:22,400 --> 0:28:29,680
almost a quarter million survivors. So this was a retrospective cohort study and a time to event

272
0:28:29,680 --> 0:28:35,920
analysis, and they were using data obtained from the tri-NEXS electronic health records. So

273
0:28:36,640 --> 0:28:42,640
over 81 million patients in this database, and I should say this database exists, right? I think

274
0:28:42,640 --> 0:28:49,760
we were painfully hearing of some early databases that were figments, but the primary cohort

275
0:28:49,760 --> 0:28:58,960
comprised 236,379 patients who had a COVID-19 diagnosis, and they had one matched control cohort,

276
0:28:58,960 --> 0:29:03,760
including patients diagnosed with influenza, other matched cohorts who could have patients

277
0:29:03,760 --> 0:29:09,280
diagnosed with other respiratory tract infections during the same period. And they reported that

278
0:29:09,280 --> 0:29:16,080
the estimated incidence of a neurological or psychiatric diagnosis in the following six months

279
0:29:16,080 --> 0:29:26,000
was 33.6%. So a third of these survivors of COVID-19 hospitalization. If you were admitted to an ICU,

280
0:29:26,000 --> 0:29:33,840
the estimated incidence was almost 50%, it was 46.4. So this is huge. And now what were these

281
0:29:33,840 --> 0:29:40,800
neurological diagnoses? Intracranial hemorrhage, ischemic stroke, Parkinson's disease,

282
0:29:40,800 --> 0:29:48,000
Guillain-Barre, nerve, nerve root, plexus disorders, myel, neural junction, and muscle disease,

283
0:29:48,000 --> 0:29:55,600
encephalitis, dementia, psychosis, mood and anxiety disorders, substance use disorders,

284
0:29:56,240 --> 0:30:03,440
and a lot of insomnia. Now I have to say this report is consistent with the work of some

285
0:30:03,440 --> 0:30:10,720
of my colleagues at UHG. I think they're a little frustrated because their study is still winding

286
0:30:10,720 --> 0:30:16,800
its way through peer review. But I had the opportunity earlier this week, the pleasure I should say

287
0:30:16,800 --> 0:30:21,680
of speaking with our pro-health neurology group. I always like to get this is what we see in the

288
0:30:21,680 --> 0:30:26,480
literature, this is what the studies are showing, what are we seeing in our clinical practice.

289
0:30:26,480 --> 0:30:32,160
And so several of the neurologists were describing the challenges that we're seeing here in the

290
0:30:32,160 --> 0:30:38,720
tri-state area. Presentations consisted with small fiber neuropathies with burning sensations,

291
0:30:39,440 --> 0:30:45,840
and a lot of issues with either new onset headaches or an escalation of headaches from

292
0:30:45,840 --> 0:30:51,840
intermittent to chronic. So unfortunately a growing number of individuals who maybe had

293
0:30:51,840 --> 0:30:58,640
an intermittent vascular or migraine disorder, and now they're in constant pain, really challenging

294
0:30:58,640 --> 0:31:05,040
to treat these individuals. I think this will get a lot of attention because it's quite upsetting,

295
0:31:05,040 --> 0:31:09,840
I think, to not have your mind working, to be in constant pain, to be suffering.

296
0:31:09,840 --> 0:31:16,080
I think that's enough bad news, right? It's enough bad news. I'll throw a little bit of good news in

297
0:31:16,080 --> 0:31:20,480
here, and I think this is some perspective on the good news as well. We've heard a little bit,

298
0:31:20,480 --> 0:31:26,080
and I've shared a little bit about the potential benefit of vaccination on long COVID. And I've

299
0:31:26,080 --> 0:31:30,960
been seeing that. A lot of us who take care of a large cohort of patients who are never sick

300
0:31:30,960 --> 0:31:36,000
enough to get in the hospital, but continue to suffer with the brain fog, the fatigue,

301
0:31:36,000 --> 0:31:42,560
all these other disorders. We are seeing a large chunk of them report feeling better with vaccination.

302
0:31:42,560 --> 0:31:48,080
But I reached out to Lawrence Schulman. He's one of our pulmonologists, and talking to him about

303
0:31:48,080 --> 0:31:53,360
what about people that were sick enough? Now they have pulmonary scarring. Now they have things

304
0:31:53,360 --> 0:32:00,240
that I just wouldn't really think a vaccination would reverse. In those individuals, a lot of our

305
0:32:00,240 --> 0:32:05,680
long-term care COVID or post-COVID recovery centers, where they're dealing people who had

306
0:32:06,400 --> 0:32:11,760
cardiac insults and pulmonary issues, a lot of this, I have to say, unfortunately, there

307
0:32:11,760 --> 0:32:17,440
was a subset of patients where this is not reversible by vaccination. So still encouraging all these

308
0:32:17,440 --> 0:32:23,280
individuals to get vaccinated, but it does sort of temper that optimism. There does appear to be

309
0:32:23,280 --> 0:32:27,840
certain patient populations that are more likely to benefit from vaccinations, but there are certain

310
0:32:27,840 --> 0:32:34,640
other individuals where a lot of the damage is done, the scarring is there. So I will close by saying,

311
0:32:34,640 --> 0:32:40,800
thanks again for all the support we've had. This will be our final month, right? April, we are

312
0:32:40,800 --> 0:32:46,240
supporting the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, and part of that support

313
0:32:46,240 --> 0:32:54,320
will be providing scholarships for early career women investigators from low-income parts of the

314
0:32:54,320 --> 0:32:59,840
world. So we're excited to do that. We're excited to allow them to attend the fall meeting,

315
0:33:00,800 --> 0:33:04,080
and then hopefully really give them a boost and do something about

316
0:33:04,080 --> 0:33:09,440
so many of the inequities that currently exist. All right, time for a few emails for

317
0:33:09,440 --> 0:33:16,640
Daniel. You can send yours to Daniel at microbe.tv. The first is from Alida in Canada, who's a nurse

318
0:33:17,360 --> 0:33:23,440
and is curious about you're saying it is a must to aspirate before injecting an IM.

319
0:33:23,440 --> 0:33:28,240
In Canada, we have not done this for more than 20 years. I started nursing in 2000,

320
0:33:28,240 --> 0:33:33,840
and I've never aspirated. I've given thousands of vaccines and injections. CDC does not recommend

321
0:33:33,840 --> 0:33:42,000
aspiration, just my thoughts. No, they're more than just your thoughts. You're right.

322
0:33:43,120 --> 0:33:48,320
So what is this issue of aspiration pulling back the plunger while doing an IM injection?

323
0:33:50,960 --> 0:33:54,480
Hopefully I didn't say it's a must. Hopefully I said this is fairly standard,

324
0:33:54,480 --> 0:34:02,560
still common. Should it be? So what does the CDC say? What does the WHO say? What is the science?

325
0:34:02,560 --> 0:34:07,600
What is actually recommended and actually is not pulling back perhaps best practice?

326
0:34:07,600 --> 0:34:15,040
Let's go through this. Thank you for asking this question. As per the CDC, aspiration before

327
0:34:15,040 --> 0:34:20,400
injection of vaccines or toxoids, pulling back on the syringe plunger after needle insertion,

328
0:34:20,400 --> 0:34:25,120
but before injection is not necessary because no large blood vessels are present at the

329
0:34:25,120 --> 0:34:31,360
recommended injection sites. Any process that includes aspiration may be more painful for

330
0:34:31,360 --> 0:34:36,640
infants. Actually, I think you're timing on when you graduate is appropriate. They reference

331
0:34:36,640 --> 0:34:43,760
the study back in the 90s, and the WHO does not recommend the plunger pull. So what does the

332
0:34:43,760 --> 0:34:49,360
science say? I have to say, based on what we know, the need for aspiration prior to administering an

333
0:34:49,360 --> 0:34:55,600
injection is dependent on certain factors. As a general rule, I'm going to say the science does

334
0:34:55,600 --> 0:35:01,760
not support that you need to pull back on the plunger. And there's ample evidence suggesting

335
0:35:01,760 --> 0:35:07,520
that. But what are the couple little caveats, right? It still is fairly standard. A lot of people do

336
0:35:07,520 --> 0:35:13,200
this. Is there harm? Well, as mentioned in the pediatric population, the original teaching was

337
0:35:13,200 --> 0:35:18,160
you held negative pressure for five seconds to make sure no blood would come up. That actually

338
0:35:18,160 --> 0:35:24,400
creates pain. That is painful. It is delaying. Some of us that I think this is interesting.

339
0:35:24,400 --> 0:35:28,880
What about epinephrine? You say, like, Oh, this is epinephrine. If I got that into a blood vessel,

340
0:35:28,880 --> 0:35:33,040
my gosh, that that could be quite different than an I am injection of epinephrine.

341
0:35:33,040 --> 0:35:38,560
Now let's all think about those epipeds, right? Those epipeds you basically put against your lateral

342
0:35:38,560 --> 0:35:43,200
thigh, you push a button and boom, out comes the needle and out comes the medicine. Things are a

343
0:35:43,200 --> 0:35:48,960
little different now, I have to say. I have seen people put injections in the deltoid bursa.

344
0:35:48,960 --> 0:35:56,160
I have seen people completely miss the muscle and put it in the fat. Probably the pulling back

345
0:35:56,160 --> 0:36:01,280
on the plunger is probably a small issue. What are the big issues getting that needle into the

346
0:36:01,280 --> 0:36:08,160
muscle using a one inch needle? So you actually get through whatever subcutaneous tissue and into

347
0:36:08,160 --> 0:36:13,840
it. If you're going to do IV, you definitely, well, I'm going to use the word, definitely.

348
0:36:13,840 --> 0:36:17,680
You do want to make sure you're in the vessel because a lot of our medicines, if they're

349
0:36:17,680 --> 0:36:23,360
infiltrating, can actually be caustic and cost tissue damage. But yeah, if you're going to put

350
0:36:23,360 --> 0:36:27,600
it into a muscle and you know what you're doing and you're actually in the muscle,

351
0:36:27,600 --> 0:36:33,120
do you really need to pull back? No. Is it better not to pull back? Yeah, probably actually,

352
0:36:33,120 --> 0:36:37,200
I think best practice would be no. If you're going to give the shots in the deltoid,

353
0:36:37,200 --> 0:36:41,200
put it in the deltoid, not in the bursa, not in the chubby part of the arm.

354
0:36:41,200 --> 0:36:47,600
If you're thinking about doing a buttock shot, actually consider moving that to lateral thigh.

355
0:36:47,600 --> 0:36:51,840
Well, you actually got a lot of emails about that and they were divided between,

356
0:36:52,400 --> 0:36:57,680
we don't do it and we do it. It was very interesting. So it's one of those situations.

357
0:36:58,640 --> 0:37:02,080
Well, let's come up, I think, Vincent, because the whole AstraZeneca issue.

358
0:37:02,640 --> 0:37:08,480
And one of the theories they have there is that maybe, you know, younger people better,

359
0:37:08,480 --> 0:37:13,120
you know, vascularized muscle. Maybe there are large enough vessels that you're getting it in

360
0:37:13,120 --> 0:37:18,800
there. It's good to have the science and the current recommendations. We did so far this week,

361
0:37:18,800 --> 0:37:24,320
213 vaccinations in my office. We're doing another 100 tomorrow afternoon into the evening.

362
0:37:25,600 --> 0:37:31,920
Have I been pulled back on that plunger every time? No. Have I pulled back ever? No. So I'll

363
0:37:31,920 --> 0:37:41,680
fast up. Okay. Deepa writes, I have been advised by my most excellent rheumatologist to skip two

364
0:37:41,680 --> 0:37:47,600
doses of methotrexate after taking any vaccine, including the one for SARS-CoV-2 based on the

365
0:37:47,600 --> 0:37:51,760
attached publication. This is the first study I'm aware of that carefully evaluated the immune

366
0:37:51,760 --> 0:37:57,440
response to flu vaccine in RA patients. They randomized to two cohorts, one that skipped

367
0:37:57,440 --> 0:38:02,880
two doses of methotrexate, one that did not. There is quite a remarkable and significant

368
0:38:02,880 --> 0:38:07,120
difference in the antibody response elicited in favor of skipping methotrexate.

369
0:38:07,120 --> 0:38:12,160
Key finding, methotrexate discontinuation for two weeks after vaccination significantly

370
0:38:12,160 --> 0:38:18,160
increases immunogenicity of a seasonal influenza vaccine in patients with rheumatoid arthritis,

371
0:38:18,160 --> 0:38:23,360
who had been on a stable dose of methotrexate without significantly altering,

372
0:38:23,360 --> 0:38:28,400
increasing risk of disease activity. I hope this is helpful to you,

373
0:38:28,400 --> 0:38:33,040
your patients and listeners of the podcast. Not many people are aware of this study.

374
0:38:33,040 --> 0:38:38,720
We need more studies like this. No, this is great. So thank you. Actually,

375
0:38:38,720 --> 0:38:42,720
Deepa, we do need more studies like this. And there's no reason that we can't be getting them,

376
0:38:42,720 --> 0:38:47,920
right? We are currently vaccinating billions of people by the time we're done here.

377
0:38:47,920 --> 0:38:54,960
And this is the time. And I know a lot of scientists have talked about, we need a rapid review,

378
0:38:54,960 --> 0:39:00,960
rapid ability to fire up these studies. And if you think about it, right? These are studies

379
0:39:00,960 --> 0:39:07,120
that are minimal harm. They're kind of observational studies. Rheumatologists, physicians who are

380
0:39:07,120 --> 0:39:12,640
using these medications are trying to space these out. Some people sort of almost practice

381
0:39:12,640 --> 0:39:17,520
preference might be only a week. Some people don't do this. Other people are getting this

382
0:39:17,520 --> 0:39:23,760
two week. This is data. I think there would be very valuable in helping us just at immunizations

383
0:39:23,760 --> 0:39:29,840
across the board, right? We do not only influenza vaccines, hopefully every year. But now we do

384
0:39:29,840 --> 0:39:34,800
COVID vaccines. We have a lot of vaccines. So having really good science-based guidance here

385
0:39:34,800 --> 0:39:42,000
would be tremendous. All right, one more from Mary Ann who writes, I got my first dose of Pfizer

386
0:39:42,000 --> 0:39:48,160
March 23 at the time I signed up. Walgreens had a scheduled a second dose four weeks out.

387
0:39:48,160 --> 0:39:53,520
And my next is scheduled 28 days. And she found out yesterday by the times that Walgreens had

388
0:39:53,520 --> 0:39:58,880
taken upon themselves to schedule these second doses at their convenience, rather than at the

389
0:39:58,880 --> 0:40:06,560
tested interval, which should be three weeks, 21 days. And Mary Ann goes on to expressing her

390
0:40:06,560 --> 0:40:13,760
displeasure with Walgreens and wants to know any advice. Should I be looking at a booster

391
0:40:13,760 --> 0:40:18,480
sooner than later? Should I ask my doctor for antibody testing? What can I do? I was looking

392
0:40:18,480 --> 0:40:23,440
forward to getting out of my house again. Now I feel unsure. I figure I'll be wearing a mask

393
0:40:24,240 --> 0:40:33,760
forever. Okay. So don't be so upset. Yeah, this was interesting, right? Walgreens decided that it

394
0:40:33,760 --> 0:40:41,040
would be easier for them for their scheduling system to just do four weeks between shots and

395
0:40:41,040 --> 0:40:46,080
just didn't care whether it was Pfizer or Baderda, which is interesting too, right? Because they're

396
0:40:46,080 --> 0:40:51,280
shipping those second doses out and then they're sitting on a shelf somewhere for like an extra

397
0:40:51,280 --> 0:40:57,760
week, right? Not in people's arms. And Walgreens was basically taken a task when this became public

398
0:40:57,760 --> 0:41:02,960
and told that that that is not what we recommend. You need to be giving those second doses,

399
0:41:02,960 --> 0:41:08,080
you know, 21 days or sort of four side, four days either side of those 21 days,

400
0:41:08,080 --> 0:41:13,120
not waiting till 28 days, unless, you know, as we say, extraordinary circumstances.

401
0:41:14,160 --> 0:41:19,600
So, you know, go ahead, get that second dose when you can get it. Do I think scientifically,

402
0:41:19,600 --> 0:41:24,320
it makes a difference whether you're getting it at 21 days or 28, you know, in a lot of ways,

403
0:41:24,320 --> 0:41:30,800
I compare Moderna and Pfizer to Coca-Cola in a CAD versus Coca-Cola in a bottle. You're getting

404
0:41:30,800 --> 0:41:37,520
the same mRNA. The packaging is a little bit different. You know, the size is a little bit

405
0:41:37,520 --> 0:41:42,480
different. But the outcome, it's going to quench your thirst. It's going to protect you from COVID

406
0:41:42,480 --> 0:41:49,360
quite well. So yeah, don't feel like Walgreens creating this difficulty is going to mean that

407
0:41:49,360 --> 0:41:54,080
you're going to be less protected at the end of the day. So Marianne says, thank you and the

408
0:41:54,080 --> 0:41:58,880
whole Twif team for being a calm place to find accurate information. You guys get an A plus plus,

409
0:41:58,880 --> 0:42:09,040
Walgreens gets an F minus. Okay. And on that note, that is COVID-19 clinical update number 57

410
0:42:09,040 --> 0:42:29,360
with Dr. Daniel Griffin. Thank you, Daniel. All right. Thank you so much. And everyone, be safe.
