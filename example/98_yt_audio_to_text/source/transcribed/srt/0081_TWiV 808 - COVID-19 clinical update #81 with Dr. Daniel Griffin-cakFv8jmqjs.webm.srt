0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:06,880
This week in virology, the podcast about viruses, the kind that make you sick.

2
0:00:10,400 --> 0:00:21,040
From Microbe TV, this is Twiv, this week in virology. Episode 808 recorded on September 23, 2021.

3
0:00:21,680 --> 0:00:27,680
I'm Vincent Draconiello, and you're listening to the podcast all about viruses. Joining me today

4
0:00:27,680 --> 0:00:36,880
from New York, Daniel Griffin. Hello, everyone. Episode 81, or I should say clinical update,

5
0:00:36,880 --> 0:00:45,600
number 81, Daniel. My question for today, when do you think five to 12-year-olds will get vaccinated?

6
0:00:46,320 --> 0:00:52,800
You know, that's going to be right in my first section on children and COVID, Vincent.

7
0:00:52,800 --> 0:00:57,600
All right. I feel like you've preempted it, but let's get going and we'll get right there.

8
0:00:57,600 --> 0:01:04,400
So I will start off with a quotation, no pessimist ever discovered the secret of the stars,

9
0:01:04,400 --> 0:01:09,600
or sailed to an uncharted land, or opened a new doorway for the human spirit.

10
0:01:10,320 --> 0:01:15,920
And that is Helen Keller. And next to the Helen Keller Institute is just down the road from me,

11
0:01:15,920 --> 0:01:21,760
prior to the pandemic, prior to me slipping on a wet surface and tearing the lateral medial

12
0:01:21,760 --> 0:01:27,600
meniscus in my left knee, my family and I would all do the Helen Keller fundraiser yearly run. So

13
0:01:28,320 --> 0:01:33,040
maybe at some point when I can free up some time in my schedule to fix that knee, I'll be doing that

14
0:01:33,040 --> 0:01:42,800
again. But what an inspirational woman. As far as an update, you know, people, it's so regional

15
0:01:42,800 --> 0:01:48,880
in our country. It's so regional in the world, right? What's been happening? We are seeing things

16
0:01:48,880 --> 0:01:55,360
get a little bit better, particularly here in the New York area. You know, part of what I tell

17
0:01:55,360 --> 0:02:00,240
people when they ask me, this is only so many people that can get infected or vaccinated. So

18
0:02:01,440 --> 0:02:07,280
there is, you know, there is that. But let's get right into children. So we have some, I'm going to

19
0:02:07,280 --> 0:02:14,720
say exciting things on the horizon or that we're hearing here. And I think finally people have

20
0:02:14,720 --> 0:02:18,640
come to realize that children are at risk for COVID. I think that's just sort of black

21
0:02:18,640 --> 0:02:24,000
and white. That was really a bit of a mistake and it's unfortunate. You know, if we say we're

22
0:02:24,000 --> 0:02:29,920
still seeing about a quarter million children a week get infected. We're seeing thousands of

23
0:02:29,920 --> 0:02:35,120
children end up in the hospital. We're seeing a number of children die every week here in the

24
0:02:35,120 --> 0:02:41,520
U.S. and worldwide that continues. I've talked about resources in the past. Not only can you go

25
0:02:41,520 --> 0:02:48,560
to the AAP site, not only can you go to the special CDC pediatric data, I'm going to throw

26
0:02:48,560 --> 0:02:57,440
another site at you and this is COVID net and this is at GIS.cdc.gov. And here you can actually

27
0:02:57,440 --> 0:03:03,040
break down by age what is going on with regard to different things, particularly hospitalizations.

28
0:03:03,040 --> 0:03:09,360
And it's a bit disturbing when you look at the rate of hospitalization per 100,000 broken down by

29
0:03:09,360 --> 0:03:16,960
individuals under 18. And the highest is in the zero to four really, really disturbing.

30
0:03:16,960 --> 0:03:22,640
The youngest children are being impacted. So we're going to talk about a couple things today

31
0:03:22,640 --> 0:03:28,960
about what might be done to help those individuals. And saying that we're going to talk first about

32
0:03:30,080 --> 0:03:36,960
children, people aged five to 12. So straight to vaccines for five to 12. So on Monday,

33
0:03:36,960 --> 0:03:41,920
September 20th at 6.45 AM, I think everyone, you got to get up at 6.44 and be ready for these

34
0:03:41,920 --> 0:03:48,160
headlines. We saw the press release from Pfizer with the headline Pfizer and biotech announced

35
0:03:48,160 --> 0:03:54,640
positive top line results from pivotal trial of COVID-19 vaccine in children five to 11 years.

36
0:03:55,600 --> 0:04:02,880
And so Pfizer and BioNTech announced results from a phase two, three trial showing a favorable

37
0:04:02,880 --> 0:04:09,200
safety profile and robust neutralizing anybody responses in children five to 11 years of age

38
0:04:09,200 --> 0:04:18,400
using a two dose regimen of 10 micrograms administered 21 days apart, a smaller dose than the 30

39
0:04:18,400 --> 0:04:23,200
micrograms that's currently be used in people 12 and older. So all right, so that's the headline.

40
0:04:23,200 --> 0:04:28,000
But what was the what was the data? We don't have it all. It's not peer reviewed. We're going to get

41
0:04:28,000 --> 0:04:36,880
more coming. But in this trial, they reported data from 2,268 participants age five to 11 years

42
0:04:36,880 --> 0:04:42,960
of age. And they reported that the SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody geometric mean titer

43
0:04:42,960 --> 0:04:55,360
was 1,197.6, one month after the first dose in this group compared to 1,146.5 from participants

44
0:04:55,360 --> 0:05:02,000
aged 16 to 25 who had gotten the 30 microgram. That was the control group. So really, you're

45
0:05:02,000 --> 0:05:08,560
getting about the same confidence interval overlap. Really, the median mean there geometric mean

46
0:05:08,560 --> 0:05:16,320
is actually a higher higher. So the point here, and I think we need to talk about this a little,

47
0:05:16,320 --> 0:05:21,040
is this is exciting news. You're seeing this robust response. You're seeing that a smaller

48
0:05:21,040 --> 0:05:27,280
dose can be used. So don't just go out and use the 30 microgram dose off label. Pfizer is in

49
0:05:27,280 --> 0:05:34,480
preparation to go ahead and make these smaller doses. They're going to new production challenges

50
0:05:34,480 --> 0:05:40,320
to make this happen. For the United States, the companies expect to include this data in a near

51
0:05:40,320 --> 0:05:47,520
term submission for EUA as they continue to accumulate safety and efficacy data.

52
0:05:48,560 --> 0:05:55,200
But a couple things, and I'm sure this will be a discussion, this is a 2,268. So we say safety

53
0:05:55,200 --> 0:06:02,400
data. That's a small number of individuals. As this rolls out in the first four to eight weeks,

54
0:06:02,400 --> 0:06:08,880
we're going to get what we call phase four data where we have post-marketing. So there will be

55
0:06:08,880 --> 0:06:13,760
some parents. I'm sure that we'll want to wait a few extra weeks. And this is going to be sort of

56
0:06:13,760 --> 0:06:19,520
that balance between what we're seeing now with quarter million individuals here in the US alone

57
0:06:19,520 --> 0:06:23,440
getting infected thousands in the hospital. Parents will want to weigh that risk benefit

58
0:06:23,440 --> 0:06:27,920
during the first four to eight weeks as we get even more safety data on this age group.

59
0:06:29,120 --> 0:06:35,600
Daniel, how do you figure out 10 micrograms? And it's from going from 11 to 12 years,

60
0:06:36,320 --> 0:06:42,880
it seems like a sharp cut. How does that work? Yes. No, I still remember, right? Like,

61
0:06:44,160 --> 0:06:52,960
Barnaby turned 16. He was going to almost qualify, and then they dropped the EUA for

62
0:06:52,960 --> 0:06:57,840
younger ages. So we were looking at Barnaby 15 years at nine months, and he didn't qualify for

63
0:06:57,840 --> 0:07:06,720
the vaccine, but magically in three months. And then on the bottom end here, what about those

64
0:07:06,720 --> 0:07:13,200
younger children? What about children who are two, three, and four? So your four years, your 11

65
0:07:13,200 --> 0:07:23,600
months, maybe you're large for your age. So yeah, these cutoffs are not exact science. So,

66
0:07:25,200 --> 0:07:31,840
yeah. But presumably they have some experience on dosing for different ages. And so they use that

67
0:07:31,840 --> 0:07:37,680
to calculate 10 micrograms, I suppose, right? Well, you know, with the mRNA vaccines, we don't

68
0:07:37,680 --> 0:07:42,880
have quite as much experience as we would like, right? So the amount of mRNA and the Moderna vaccine

69
0:07:42,880 --> 0:07:48,160
is three times more. And maybe that will turn out to be relevant in some things that we discussed

70
0:07:48,160 --> 0:07:56,160
later. Okay. All right. Now we move to that pre-exposure transmission testing period. I like to say

71
0:07:56,160 --> 0:08:04,960
never miss an opportunity to test, to test, and remember, masks are cool. It appears that people

72
0:08:04,960 --> 0:08:12,960
are finally catching on. And rapid tests, like monoclonals, are now in short supply. Rapid tests

73
0:08:12,960 --> 0:08:18,480
are finally being embraced. And we have over-the-counter tests. But now you're searching everywhere to

74
0:08:18,480 --> 0:08:24,800
try to find them, because they're being sold out across the country. So I think this reinforces a

75
0:08:24,800 --> 0:08:30,320
message that Vincent, I'm going to thank you for getting Michael Menon to sort of spread this early

76
0:08:30,320 --> 0:08:36,400
on, is rapid tests are a really excellent public health tool. And in that two days before symptom

77
0:08:36,400 --> 0:08:42,560
onset, in that three to five days afterwards, these are incredibly sensitive and rapid ways

78
0:08:42,560 --> 0:08:49,760
of detecting people who are contagious, detecting people who are acutely ill. If you need to repeat

79
0:08:49,760 --> 0:08:56,000
that test the next day, we're talking about tests that cost five to $10 here in the US per test,

80
0:08:56,000 --> 0:09:02,000
where results are back in 15 minutes versus results that take some areas of the country

81
0:09:02,000 --> 0:09:07,360
talking to a colleague in Oregon, where it's about four days in some places to get that result back.

82
0:09:07,360 --> 0:09:14,880
Exciting in this area, we heard that part of the $2 billion testing plan from the White House

83
0:09:14,880 --> 0:09:23,200
involves buying 647 million over-the-counter rapid tests to help subsidize these, to help get them

84
0:09:23,200 --> 0:09:29,600
out so we can actually get those results. All right, active vaccination, never miss an opportunity

85
0:09:29,600 --> 0:09:36,560
to vaccinate. And I was listening to a little bit of the United Nations. And vaccination is how

86
0:09:36,560 --> 0:09:42,400
this pandemic ends is actually a theme. So I think they've been listening to Twiv. So let's talk a

87
0:09:42,400 --> 0:09:47,600
little bit about vaccines, the Jabs that keep you from getting sick. And a couple of things,

88
0:09:47,600 --> 0:09:53,600
and the first will be boosters. Friday, September 17th, the FDA advisory panel met,

89
0:09:53,600 --> 0:09:58,960
and it was very interesting. I think what was interesting was sort of like the live stream

90
0:09:58,960 --> 0:10:04,000
media coverage. You know, here was a discussion, you know, started off with a first vote,

91
0:10:04,000 --> 0:10:08,880
moved on to another vote. And the whole time, sort of, I think people were on the edge of their

92
0:10:08,880 --> 0:10:14,240
seat waiting for the different updates. And it got messy at times. There were words used that I

93
0:10:14,240 --> 0:10:21,200
don't use in my house and that we don't allow our children to use. But I thought it was a really

94
0:10:21,200 --> 0:10:26,800
healthy discussion. And a big thing that came out of this was this reassuring. This guy is not

95
0:10:26,800 --> 0:10:34,080
falling. There was some certain information that led to some of their recommendations. And then on

96
0:10:34,080 --> 0:10:43,040
Wednesday, the 22nd of this September 2021, we heard that following this advisory board discussion

97
0:10:43,040 --> 0:10:50,240
and vote that the FDA authorized booster dose of Pfizer biotech COVID-19 vaccine for certain

98
0:10:50,240 --> 0:10:58,400
populations. And so the US FDA amended the emergency use authorization, the EUA, for the Pfizer

99
0:10:58,400 --> 0:11:06,720
biotech COVID-19 vaccine to allow for a single booster dose to be administered at least six months

100
0:11:06,720 --> 0:11:11,040
after the completion of the primary series in these three categories.

101
0:11:11,040 --> 0:11:18,160
Individuals 65 years of age are older. Individuals 18 through 64 years of age at high risk of severe

102
0:11:18,160 --> 0:11:26,080
COVID-19 and individuals 18 through 64 years of age, whose frequent institutional or occupational

103
0:11:26,080 --> 0:11:32,160
exposure to SARS-CoV-2 puts them at high risk of serious complications of COVID-19, including

104
0:11:32,160 --> 0:11:40,000
severe COVID-19. And this authorization for clarity only applies to Pfizer biotech COVID-19 vaccine.

105
0:11:40,000 --> 0:11:45,920
So I'm going to pull you in on this, Vincent. But what basically came out of this was really a

106
0:11:45,920 --> 0:11:52,240
public health decision. It was a risk benefit. It was very clear on Friday from the discussion

107
0:11:52,240 --> 0:11:57,760
that all the data that these individuals want is not yet available. It's not yet been available

108
0:11:57,760 --> 0:12:02,640
long enough for them to really go through it. So this was one of those public health decisions,

109
0:12:02,640 --> 0:12:09,280
where it seemed reasonable and appropriate to extend the EUA. But the initial idea that

110
0:12:09,280 --> 0:12:16,560
everyone, 18, 19, 20-year-olds should be getting third doses did not make sense, was not recommended

111
0:12:16,560 --> 0:12:22,000
by that advisory committee. In the coming weeks, we're going to learn more. We're going to learn

112
0:12:22,000 --> 0:12:29,360
a lot about when and who might get that second shot. We're also going to learn, is this just

113
0:12:29,360 --> 0:12:36,160
a Pfizer specific? Is Pfizer now the three and you're done vaccine? Will Pfizer require in the

114
0:12:36,160 --> 0:12:43,360
future yearly boosters? And then what is the situation with Moderna and J&J? And don't worry,

115
0:12:43,360 --> 0:12:47,600
we have some exciting data on J&J to follow. So Vincent, I don't know if you had any thoughts?

116
0:12:49,040 --> 0:12:54,400
So this is just for people who previously received Pfizer, correct?

117
0:12:54,400 --> 0:12:58,960
People who previously got two shots of Pfizer and now a third shot.

118
0:12:58,960 --> 0:13:07,280
So if you really think the science tells you to have a third shot, you have to make it everybody,

119
0:13:07,280 --> 0:13:12,560
not just Pfizer. You have to make it Moderna too, even though they didn't apply for it. So

120
0:13:13,840 --> 0:13:19,200
as I've said before, I don't see the data. If I were eligible, I wouldn't take it,

121
0:13:19,200 --> 0:13:24,400
because I don't think you need it. And I think that as we discussed last time that paper,

122
0:13:24,400 --> 0:13:29,200
that opinion paper in the Lancet really laid it well out, the science doesn't say you need it yet.

123
0:13:29,200 --> 0:13:33,280
Yeah. And the science will come. And what we're also going to see, and this also,

124
0:13:33,280 --> 0:13:39,120
I think is similar to echo what I talked about early on, is we are now seeing a number of

125
0:13:39,120 --> 0:13:43,600
individuals. We already know a number of individuals went ahead and got that third shot. So we're

126
0:13:43,600 --> 0:13:49,600
going to see in coming weeks here, a large number of millions of individuals who got Pfizer will

127
0:13:49,600 --> 0:13:56,240
now get a third. The suggestion is that the reactogenicity is even lower with that third shot.

128
0:13:56,240 --> 0:14:01,040
We'll see more safety signal. We'll get a little more of our data. And then, yeah,

129
0:14:02,240 --> 0:14:08,000
recommendations coming soon. Here, I think is a really important thing. I want to discuss

130
0:14:08,000 --> 0:14:13,360
vaccines and pregnant women. And I think it's really incumbent on physicians to be

131
0:14:13,360 --> 0:14:21,200
very up to date on the data. And I know there's this, I'm going to say false dichotomy out there.

132
0:14:21,200 --> 0:14:28,720
The idea that people who are unvaccinated are somehow bad people, anti-vaxxers.

133
0:14:29,920 --> 0:14:35,760
And I'm going to talk about the fact that over 80% of pregnant individuals in the United States

134
0:14:35,760 --> 0:14:41,280
are not vaccinated. I'm going to talk a little bit about these are actually intelligent

135
0:14:41,280 --> 0:14:45,840
individuals who are trying to make the right choice for themselves, for their unborn baby,

136
0:14:45,840 --> 0:14:52,400
and talk a little bit about what is the information we have. I think people may remember this initially

137
0:14:52,400 --> 0:14:59,200
started off focused on physicians. But I think this is expanded beyond that. But here again,

138
0:14:59,200 --> 0:15:04,080
I want to focus on physicians to have this information, but also all of our listeners

139
0:15:04,080 --> 0:15:10,320
have the information about COVID vaccines in pregnancy, so that these decisions can be

140
0:15:10,320 --> 0:15:15,760
the informed one, the right one for that pregnant woman, the right one for that unborn child. So

141
0:15:15,760 --> 0:15:20,320
on clinical update 59, I discussed the New England Journal Medicine article,

142
0:15:20,320 --> 0:15:26,160
preliminary findings of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine safety in pregnant persons, where the authors

143
0:15:26,160 --> 0:15:35,200
reported on 35,691 v-safe participants, 16 to 54 years of age identified as pregnant and found

144
0:15:35,200 --> 0:15:43,600
no safety signals, no fertility issues, no miscarriage issues, etc. So very, very safe. In

145
0:15:43,600 --> 0:15:49,840
clinical update number 78, we continued this, this thread, and we discussed the article

146
0:15:49,840 --> 0:15:55,680
characteristics and outcomes of women with COVID-19 giving birth at US academic centers during the

147
0:15:55,680 --> 0:16:02,400
COVID-19 pandemic. This is the we're moving from safe to are these individuals at higher risk.

148
0:16:02,400 --> 0:16:09,840
And this was the study that found that pregnant women, pregnant people with COVID-19, were more

149
0:16:09,840 --> 0:16:19,120
likely to have a preterm birth, right? 16.4% versus 11.5%. So a 5% higher risk of a preterm birth,

150
0:16:19,760 --> 0:16:26,880
significantly higher rates of ICU admission over five times as likely. The odds of

151
0:16:26,880 --> 0:16:34,880
requiring mechanical ventilation, intubation, were increased more than 14-fold and a pregnant

152
0:16:34,880 --> 0:16:40,720
woman admitted to the hospital was 15 times more likely to die. So a pregnant woman who gets

153
0:16:40,720 --> 0:16:47,920
infected with COVID-19 is at very high risk. And you can imagine that this risk translates into

154
0:16:47,920 --> 0:16:53,360
bad outcomes for the unborn child, particularly as you can imagine when that pregnant woman

155
0:16:53,360 --> 0:17:00,480
might die. So we've established safety. We've talked about how this is a high risk population,

156
0:17:00,480 --> 0:17:06,800
but the safety data continues. The CDC has a special v-safe COVID-19 vaccine

157
0:17:07,440 --> 0:17:12,880
pregnancy registry website. They update this regularly. It was updated the last on the 14th

158
0:17:12,880 --> 0:17:21,760
of this month. And as of 913, the day before they updated, 158,465 pregnant women were registered

159
0:17:21,760 --> 0:17:28,080
in the v-safe after vaccination health checker. And they are reporting there is currently,

160
0:17:28,080 --> 0:17:33,200
there's still no evidence that any of the vaccines, including COVID-19 vaccines, cause

161
0:17:33,200 --> 0:17:40,320
fertility or any other problems in this population. On the risk side, unfortunately, though,

162
0:17:40,320 --> 0:17:49,040
here we have seen over 100,000 pregnant people infected and over 100 of these women have actually

163
0:17:49,040 --> 0:17:54,880
died of COVID-19. What about taking it a step further? Not only are pregnant women themselves at

164
0:17:54,880 --> 0:18:03,040
risk, not only are these vaccines safe, but is this a chance to protect two people? What happens

165
0:18:03,040 --> 0:18:08,880
when that baby is born? And the mother makes that decision to get vaccinated during pregnancy.

166
0:18:09,600 --> 0:18:13,440
Because a lot of times, and I understand this discussion, I understand the logic,

167
0:18:13,440 --> 0:18:16,800
I'm going to challenge it, the idea of why don't you just wait until you're done with your

168
0:18:16,800 --> 0:18:21,280
pregnancy and then get vaccinated. I'm going to discuss here an article where it says,

169
0:18:21,280 --> 0:18:25,920
please get vaccinated before you have that child to give that child an extra bit of protection.

170
0:18:25,920 --> 0:18:31,760
So this week, the research letter, high antibody levels in cord blood from pregnant women vaccinated

171
0:18:31,760 --> 0:18:38,320
against COVID-19 was published in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology. Here,

172
0:18:38,320 --> 0:18:44,480
as I mentioned in the US, only about 16% of pregnant women have been vaccinated despite this

173
0:18:44,480 --> 0:18:50,400
really compelling evidence. So here, what they did is they looked at umbilical cord blood.

174
0:18:50,400 --> 0:18:57,040
This is a way to assess our babies of women vaccinated while pregnant, being born with

175
0:18:57,040 --> 0:19:04,800
that protection, that high level of spike antibodies. And in this study of umbilical cord blood

176
0:19:04,800 --> 0:19:14,000
collected from 36 deliveries, 36 neonates, 100% studied were positive for the anti-spike IgG

177
0:19:14,560 --> 0:19:22,560
at high titers. Among the 36 samples, 31 were also tested for anti-nuclear capsid. These were

178
0:19:22,560 --> 0:19:27,360
all negative. So these are vaccinated women. These are women that were not infected,

179
0:19:27,360 --> 0:19:32,960
who because they were vaccinated during pregnancy, were able to pass on that protection to their

180
0:19:32,960 --> 0:19:38,480
children where we would expect that protection to last at least four months. So if you're pregnant,

181
0:19:38,480 --> 0:19:47,680
get vaccinated, protects you and your child. Now, what about which vaccine is best? I like that

182
0:19:47,680 --> 0:19:51,680
now, you know, I've been talking about the t-shirts are going to be on the different teams. I'm on

183
0:19:51,680 --> 0:19:57,440
team spike backs or Moderna here. And so you might get a little bias here as I discuss this

184
0:19:57,440 --> 0:20:04,800
comparing comparative effectiveness of Moderna, Pfizer, BioNTech, and Janssen, Johnson and Johnson

185
0:20:04,800 --> 0:20:11,200
vaccines in preventing COVID-19 hospitalizations among adults without immunocompromising conditions,

186
0:20:11,200 --> 0:20:18,640
United States, March to August 2021. This came out as an early release in the MMWR,

187
0:20:19,360 --> 0:20:25,840
actually spoke to Saratoy at the Wall Street Journal about this. And this study was looking at

188
0:20:25,840 --> 0:20:33,040
vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19 hospitalization. And I feel like whenever you say vaccine

189
0:20:33,040 --> 0:20:38,720
effectiveness, you have to add against what? This looked at adults aged greater than 18

190
0:20:39,680 --> 0:20:47,040
or older without an immunocompromised condition, immunocompromising condition admitted to 21

191
0:20:47,040 --> 0:20:54,320
hospitals within the influenza and other viruses in the acutely ill, the IV network.

192
0:20:54,320 --> 0:21:01,840
This is a case control prospective analysis. The case patients were admitted to the hospital

193
0:21:01,840 --> 0:21:10,320
with COVID-19, PCR confirmed or an antigen test. The control patients had a viral illness, but they

194
0:21:10,320 --> 0:21:20,960
had a negative test. 3,689 patients were included. So we have 1,682 case patients, 2,007 control

195
0:21:20,960 --> 0:21:31,840
patients. And what did they report? The overall vaccine efficiency, right? And we're talking about

196
0:21:31,840 --> 0:21:42,560
vaccine efficacy for preventing hospitalization. So overall, 2,362 patients were unvaccinated,

197
0:21:42,560 --> 0:21:49,120
476 or 12.9 percent were fully vaccinated with one of these vaccines. So remember the numbers

198
0:21:49,120 --> 0:21:58,000
there. So 476 were fully vaccinated with the Moderna vaccine. 738 were fully vaccinated with the Pfizer

199
0:21:58,000 --> 0:22:05,280
BioNTech vaccine. And 113 were fully vaccinated with the Janssen vaccine as a one dose.

200
0:22:05,280 --> 0:22:11,120
The vaccine efficacy against COVID-19 hospitalizations was higher for the Moderna vaccine,

201
0:22:11,120 --> 0:22:19,680
they're saying 93%. The Pfizer BioNTech, 88%. And then the vaccine efficacy for both vaccines

202
0:22:19,680 --> 0:22:24,720
was higher than the Janssen. I think there's a couple takeaways from here. If you're on team

203
0:22:24,720 --> 0:22:31,200
Moderna versus Pfizer, you can claim to have one. Another takeaway is to say that the vaccines

204
0:22:31,200 --> 0:22:37,040
continued to have very high efficacy over this period of time. And what were those sort of periods

205
0:22:37,040 --> 0:22:44,480
of time? So Moderna, say 93% for the full surveillance period with 93 in the first 120 days,

206
0:22:44,480 --> 0:22:50,960
dropping, I'd say dropping to 92, so like dropping from 93 to 92, holding above 90 at

207
0:22:50,960 --> 0:23:00,000
greater than 120 days. The full surveillance for Pfizer was 88 starting off at 91. And there is

208
0:23:00,000 --> 0:23:08,000
say a drop to 77. But there's wide confidence intervals here, 67 to 84. And then you look at

209
0:23:08,000 --> 0:23:12,640
Janssen, and we're going to get to Janssen, Janssen over this period of time in this one study,

210
0:23:12,640 --> 0:23:19,600
they're reporting 71% over time. So it's interesting that now, you know, and maybe this helps people

211
0:23:19,600 --> 0:23:26,720
get excited about vaccines and people like to have choices. I think you can take this in several

212
0:23:26,720 --> 0:23:33,840
ways. But one way you may take it is what about J and J? Maybe J and J is not just one and done.

213
0:23:33,840 --> 0:23:39,920
So this next section goes out to all the redheads in the audience. This is and by redheads, I mean

214
0:23:39,920 --> 0:23:47,520
people that got J and J vaccine, because my redheaded son got the Pfizer shots. And I don't know,

215
0:23:47,520 --> 0:23:51,360
that was an expression that my grandmother, I think I got from my Irish grandmother is the,

216
0:23:51,360 --> 0:23:57,120
you know, whenever someone was left out, it was, oh, my poor redheaded stepson, right?

217
0:23:57,120 --> 0:24:02,560
I've got to figure out the history of that expression. But we have a bit about J and J.

218
0:24:03,360 --> 0:24:10,080
So this starts off with Johnson and Johnson single shot vaccine showed strong and long lasting

219
0:24:10,080 --> 0:24:16,400
protection in the real world. This is comes out of a preprint effectiveness of the single dose

220
0:24:16,400 --> 0:24:27,120
at 26 Cove to S COVID vaccine. And what was this data, which is posted as a preprint among 390,000

221
0:24:27,120 --> 0:24:38,000
507 17 vaccinated and 1.5 24, 153 matched unvaccinated individuals. This is huge, right? About half

222
0:24:38,000 --> 0:24:42,720
a million compared to one and a half million matched unvaccinated individuals. They're reporting

223
0:24:42,720 --> 0:24:51,520
here in this preprint, vaccine efficacy was 79% for a recognized COVID-19 infection,

224
0:24:51,520 --> 0:24:59,680
right? Vaccine efficacy against infection and 81% for a COVID-19 related hospitalization.

225
0:24:59,680 --> 0:25:06,720
They reported that this was stable over calendar time. And they also looked at states with a high

226
0:25:06,720 --> 0:25:16,640
delta incidence and saw that this was holding for them as well. So when you grab your numbers,

227
0:25:16,640 --> 0:25:22,240
I think it's important to see there's points in a line. This looks good. These data were

228
0:25:22,240 --> 0:25:28,640
consistent with the phase three ensemble trial, where they were shown that those strong protection

229
0:25:28,640 --> 0:25:37,280
against severe critical disease. But what about boosters? Maybe J&J is not the one and done.

230
0:25:37,280 --> 0:25:42,240
Maybe J&J is the two and done. So what about a booster shot for folks with J&J?

231
0:25:43,360 --> 0:25:51,760
So here, the announcement, and at this point, this is press release level from J&J booster shot at

232
0:25:51,760 --> 0:26:01,280
two months. They report provided 94% protection against COVID-19 in the U.S. And this is the phase

233
0:26:01,280 --> 0:26:09,360
three ensemble to study, looking at getting another shot of the Johnson and Johnson COVID-19 vaccine

234
0:26:09,360 --> 0:26:16,000
56 days after the first. And so they say, and actually I have to say someone asked me this at work,

235
0:26:16,000 --> 0:26:22,320
they say 100% protection. The confidence interval is 33 to 100. So that's a wide confidence interval

236
0:26:22,320 --> 0:26:29,920
against severe critical COVID-19, at least 14 days post-final vaccination. 75% protection

237
0:26:29,920 --> 0:26:36,560
against symptomatic moderate to severe COVID-19. This is looking at a global data set,

238
0:26:36,560 --> 0:26:45,520
but confidence intervals 55 to 87, 94% protection against symptomatic moderate to severe COVID-19

239
0:26:45,520 --> 0:26:51,520
in the U.S. And again, wide confidence intervals 58 to 100. And then they throw a second little bit

240
0:26:51,520 --> 0:27:00,880
of data when a booster was given at six months. So booster shot at six months provided 12-fold

241
0:27:00,880 --> 0:27:06,640
increase in antibodies. Here, they're reporting that a booster of J&J, given six months after

242
0:27:06,640 --> 0:27:13,920
the single shot, compared to that second, that two months afterwards, gives you this extra 12-fold

243
0:27:13,920 --> 0:27:20,000
increase in antibodies. These rises were irrespective of age. So we're getting a little more information.

244
0:27:20,000 --> 0:27:26,480
I know people feel like, Oh my gosh, I got the J&J. How come nobody's talking about me? How come?

245
0:27:26,480 --> 0:27:31,680
And it's over 10 million people got J&J here in the U.S. alone. So we're getting more data,

246
0:27:31,680 --> 0:27:37,280
and I would not be surprised if the J&J becomes the two shots and you're done instead of the one

247
0:27:37,280 --> 0:27:44,240
and you're done. Vincent, any thoughts on all that data? So last week, we did a paper which

248
0:27:45,520 --> 0:27:53,600
showed lower efficacy for J&J and Rich Condits said, I bet a boost is what J&J needs. There you go.

249
0:27:54,240 --> 0:27:58,640
Yeah. All right. Well, he may be right. Yeah, it is interesting. And J&J is a tough vaccine

250
0:27:58,640 --> 0:28:03,760
when you look at antibody levels, because if you compare the antibody levels elicited by the

251
0:28:03,760 --> 0:28:10,160
mRNA vaccines and the J&J vaccines, it's actually two different worlds. I think you're ending up with

252
0:28:10,160 --> 0:28:13,760
geometric means in the thousands for Moderna and Pfizer. You're ending up with geometric

253
0:28:13,760 --> 0:28:19,120
mean of less than 100 for J&J. But somehow J&J works. So we're thinking there may be

254
0:28:20,480 --> 0:28:26,240
a different cellular aspect to the protection given from J&J, which again comes back to the

255
0:28:26,240 --> 0:28:31,840
issue as people talk about boosters. If someone, if there is, turns out there's waiting immunity

256
0:28:31,840 --> 0:28:38,560
with the Pfizer vaccine, should that third dose be Pfizer? Should it be J&J? Should it be Moderna?

257
0:28:39,520 --> 0:28:43,680
I don't see that data quickly coming because Pfizer is going to study Pfizer. Moderna is going to

258
0:28:43,680 --> 0:28:48,720
study Moderna. J&J is going to study J&J. There will only be small bits of information about

259
0:28:48,720 --> 0:28:55,440
heterologous or mix and match out there. All right. Passive vaccination. The theme today is,

260
0:28:55,440 --> 0:29:02,720
everyone seems to have found out monoclonal are really in demand. Here we're talking about passive

261
0:29:02,720 --> 0:29:11,200
vaccination. So pre-exposure. So this or I guess pre-positive viral test. So post-exposure prophylaxis.

262
0:29:11,200 --> 0:29:17,840
And the EUA, the emergency use authorization, was expanded for Eli Lilly's cocktail, the BAM

263
0:29:17,840 --> 0:29:25,280
line of the map, a test of the map. And now that has an EUA expansion to include post-exposure prophylaxis.

264
0:29:26,240 --> 0:29:32,160
People probably need to know a little bit about what I'm talking about here. So these neutralizing

265
0:29:32,160 --> 0:29:38,720
antibodies can be used as a cocktail to treat high-risk individuals 12 years of age and older

266
0:29:38,720 --> 0:29:44,560
who have either not been fully vaccinated or are not expected to mount an adequate immune

267
0:29:44,560 --> 0:29:50,640
response to complete vaccination and have been exposed to someone infected with SARS-CoV-2

268
0:29:51,520 --> 0:29:56,640
or who are at high risk of exposure in an institutional setting such as the nursing home or

269
0:29:56,640 --> 0:30:03,440
prison. And we talked about how Regeneron Cove also has this indication. So this is that taking

270
0:30:03,440 --> 0:30:08,640
that history. Okay, you're here. You're testing positive. Maybe you're here to get your monoclonals.

271
0:30:08,640 --> 0:30:15,920
But you have that 78-year-old husband at home with COPD and diabetes and maybe a little more

272
0:30:15,920 --> 0:30:20,160
weight than they should have. They can come in. If the test is positive, you treat them.

273
0:30:20,160 --> 0:30:25,760
If the test is negative and they're having this exposure, you also treat them. And really excellent

274
0:30:25,760 --> 0:30:31,360
data supporting this. But people may be asking, I thought we weren't doing Eli Lilly cocktails

275
0:30:31,360 --> 0:30:38,480
anymore. I thought that they stopped using these with that beta variant, with that E484K, Dr. Griffith.

276
0:30:38,480 --> 0:30:45,920
I don't know how many people are thinking that. But anyway, the nice thing about the delta variant

277
0:30:45,920 --> 0:30:51,600
is that when they have looked at this and they actually have data now in the EUA,

278
0:30:51,600 --> 0:30:56,800
authentic SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing data for bamelinibimab and a test of mab together,

279
0:30:57,680 --> 0:31:04,720
there is no change in the fold reduction in susceptibility with beta. It was greater than

280
0:31:04,720 --> 0:31:11,520
325. So this cocktail does not work against beta. It does work against delta. But do we

281
0:31:11,520 --> 0:31:16,960
have now enough data to go ahead and start using this widely as post-exposure prophylaxis?

282
0:31:16,960 --> 0:31:23,600
This is the Ugg moment, as people now know. Now that everyone is excited about monoclonals,

283
0:31:23,600 --> 0:31:31,840
now that we have over 100,000 new cases a day, we've actually started rationing monoclonals

284
0:31:31,840 --> 0:31:38,720
around the country. And there's actually a website, the phe.gov, where you can look and you can

285
0:31:38,720 --> 0:31:44,480
actually see how many doses is my state going to get for a particular week. We're only getting

286
0:31:44,480 --> 0:31:51,600
about 5,000 doses for all of New York State each week. So really not enough to meet the demand

287
0:31:51,600 --> 0:31:57,920
for everyone who can potentially benefit from this. All right, the period of detectable viral

288
0:31:57,920 --> 0:32:02,960
replication, that viral symptom phase, as I've been saying for a while, the time for monitoring

289
0:32:02,960 --> 0:32:09,120
and monoclonals, not the time for antibiotics, not the time for steroids. We can do harm with

290
0:32:09,120 --> 0:32:14,800
steroids. We can do harm and are not being helpful. We give people antibiotics here.

291
0:32:16,080 --> 0:32:20,080
But we did get what I thought was an interesting press release from Gilett.

292
0:32:20,080 --> 0:32:27,920
And this was Veklori. Anyone know what that is? Remdesivir. I'm going to replace Remdesivir

293
0:32:27,920 --> 0:32:33,360
in this press release. Remdesivir significantly reduced risk of hospitalization in high-risk

294
0:32:33,360 --> 0:32:40,480
patients with COVID-19. This data is going to be presented in detail at ID Week, which starts next

295
0:32:40,480 --> 0:32:46,480
week. I'm going to be doing a presentation. This data is from a Phase 3 randomized double-blind

296
0:32:46,480 --> 0:32:53,600
placebo control trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a three-day course of Remdesivir

297
0:32:54,400 --> 0:32:59,600
for intravenous use for the treatment of COVID-19 in non-hospitalized patients

298
0:32:59,600 --> 0:33:06,080
at high risk for disease progression. So this is, let's give Remdesivir, not during that second

299
0:33:06,080 --> 0:33:12,080
week when they're being admitted for an early inflammatory process, let's give it in that first

300
0:33:12,080 --> 0:33:19,840
week during the viral phase. And in an analysis of 562 participants randomly assigned any one-to-one

301
0:33:19,840 --> 0:33:26,800
ratio to receive Remdesivir or placebo, Remdesivir demonstrated a statistically significant

302
0:33:26,800 --> 0:33:35,040
87% reduction in risk for the composite primary endpoint of related hospitalization or all-caused

303
0:33:35,040 --> 0:33:39,280
death. There were no deaths. So this is really, you know, I'm going to sort of say this is

304
0:33:39,280 --> 0:33:46,880
going on to end up in the hospital. So the results show this 81% reduction for the

305
0:33:46,880 --> 0:33:52,320
composite secondary endpoint of medical visits at all, or all-caused mortality, but again,

306
0:33:52,320 --> 0:33:59,440
there's no mortality in this study. So 87% reduction, 81% reduction, great p-values,

307
0:33:59,440 --> 0:34:09,440
p-0.008, p-0.002. Remdesivir early on during those first few days of illness is starting to look

308
0:34:09,440 --> 0:34:15,680
like the monoclonal, starting to look like an efficacious intervention. The challenge, of course,

309
0:34:15,680 --> 0:34:21,120
is this isn't just you come in and get that one monoclonal infusion. This is a three day. So

310
0:34:21,120 --> 0:34:28,240
you got to come day one, day two, day three. So there's going to be a whole issue with operationalizing

311
0:34:28,240 --> 0:34:35,360
this. Also, the issue is will the EUA expand? And we are hearing that on the horizon, there may be

312
0:34:35,360 --> 0:34:42,960
oral drugs that may make this much easier to actually provide effective oral antivirals.

313
0:34:44,240 --> 0:34:48,800
All right. What if you wait to let early inflammatory phase when people get hospitalized,

314
0:34:48,800 --> 0:34:53,600
and then you decide to give them remdesivir? I think I've related over time. I've been less

315
0:34:53,600 --> 0:35:00,000
than impressed. And there was another publication in the Lancet Infectious Diseases,

316
0:35:00,000 --> 0:35:04,960
remdesivir plus standard of care versus standard of care alone for the treatment of patients

317
0:35:04,960 --> 0:35:12,160
admitted to hospital with COVID-19. So this is the DISC COVERIG study, that's sort of a catchy

318
0:35:13,200 --> 0:35:20,960
title there. This is a phase three randomized controlled open label trial. It's adaptive

319
0:35:20,960 --> 0:35:26,960
multi-center. It was conducted in 48 sites in Europe. So France, Belgium, Austria, Portugal,

320
0:35:26,960 --> 0:35:33,120
Luxembourg. And there were a number of different agents that were in this trial. So it's a one

321
0:35:33,120 --> 0:35:40,000
to one to one to one to one to receive different agents. One of those was the remdesivir.

322
0:35:40,800 --> 0:35:46,080
So let's just talk about the remdesivir versus control data. No significant difference in the

323
0:35:46,080 --> 0:35:54,320
occurrence of serious adverse events between treatment groups. There were no noted benefit.

324
0:35:55,040 --> 0:36:00,320
There were three deaths that were considered related to remdesivir by the investigators,

325
0:36:00,880 --> 0:36:07,600
but only one by the sponsors safety team that was a paddle renal syndrome. So really not showing

326
0:36:07,600 --> 0:36:14,080
any significant difference here. So we will probably be moving on hopefully to more exciting

327
0:36:14,080 --> 0:36:19,920
agents in the coming weeks. But what about anticoagulation? This is when people end up in the

328
0:36:19,920 --> 0:36:26,400
hospital. We start the steroids only in individuals in that second week who have oxygen saturations

329
0:36:26,400 --> 0:36:34,480
less than 94. We often give remdesivir, but anticoagulation, what dose? So I thought this was a

330
0:36:34,480 --> 0:36:38,400
good paper. I'm actually going to tell people to spend a little time looking at this, particularly

331
0:36:38,400 --> 0:36:44,400
if you're treating patients, safety and efficacy of different prophylactic anticoagulation dosing

332
0:36:44,400 --> 0:36:50,800
regimens in critically and non-critically ill patients with COVID-19, a systematic review and

333
0:36:50,800 --> 0:36:55,920
men analysis of randomized control trials. This was published in the European Heart Journal,

334
0:36:55,920 --> 0:37:01,360
cardiovascular pharmacology, and the authors searched for randomized control trials,

335
0:37:01,360 --> 0:37:06,160
comparing treatment with an escalated dose, so an intermediate or therapeutic dose,

336
0:37:06,160 --> 0:37:11,440
versus a standard prophylactic dose, looking at critically and non-critically ill COVID

337
0:37:11,440 --> 0:37:16,720
patients that required hospitalization. And these are individuals who weren't on anticoagulation

338
0:37:16,720 --> 0:37:23,520
for some other reasons, specifically COVID-related. The primary efficacy endpoint was all caused

339
0:37:23,520 --> 0:37:29,760
death, and the primary safety endpoint was major bleeding. Seven randomized control trials were

340
0:37:29,760 --> 0:37:38,880
identified. This included 5,154 patients followed for an average of 33 days, and we're comparing

341
0:37:38,880 --> 0:37:46,240
standard dose prophylactic anticoagulation versus this escalated dose anticoagulation.

342
0:37:47,360 --> 0:37:52,800
And this was not associated with a reduction in all-cause mortality, so when you escalate it

343
0:37:52,800 --> 0:37:59,920
to a higher dose, we're talking 17.8 versus 18.6, so you're not getting an extra benefit, but there was

344
0:38:00,640 --> 0:38:09,040
an associated increase in major bleeding up to 2.4 percent from 1.4, so a relative risk of 1.73,

345
0:38:09,760 --> 0:38:20,000
and that was confidence intervals 1.15 to 2.60. So we do know that if you use higher dose anticoagulation,

346
0:38:20,000 --> 0:38:26,720
you will have less clots, but you will also have more bleeds, and overall, you're not getting a

347
0:38:26,720 --> 0:38:34,800
statistically significant mortality benefit to doing that. So current recommendations are still

348
0:38:34,800 --> 0:38:41,040
prophylactic dosing across the board, but what's nice about this paper is you can actually look

349
0:38:41,040 --> 0:38:45,360
through. You can look at the different studies. Again, we're at a point now when I don't think

350
0:38:45,360 --> 0:38:50,000
people should be just grabbing one study, even if it's published in the England Journal, you need to

351
0:38:50,000 --> 0:38:54,160
look at all the studies when you're trying to come up, and when I sit on the American side of

352
0:38:54,160 --> 0:39:00,160
hematology guideline panel, we are looking through dozens, hundreds of studies at this point trying

353
0:39:00,160 --> 0:39:05,840
to really come up with what does the science tell us. The science, unfortunately, is still low

354
0:39:05,840 --> 0:39:12,320
quality, I will say, and if you look through this study, you're going to see that one of the outliers

355
0:39:12,320 --> 0:39:21,280
is actually the REMCAP active for a TTACC paper. And what you have to do is that was a pretty large

356
0:39:21,280 --> 0:39:29,440
number of individuals, 2,219, so as the potential to shift biases. But I will suggest people spend

357
0:39:29,440 --> 0:39:34,880
a little bit of time reading this, try to get some context on what we know and the decisions

358
0:39:34,880 --> 0:39:40,720
to be made about what level of anticoagulation. But I think it just reinforces, you know,

359
0:39:40,720 --> 0:39:46,800
an individualized assessment of the patient's risk of thrombosis, and bleeding is important

360
0:39:46,800 --> 0:39:53,600
when deciding on anticoagulation intensity. All right, and I'm going to sort of wrap it up here

361
0:39:53,600 --> 0:39:59,040
with what I think is a little bit of good news. No one is safe until everyone is safe. This week,

362
0:39:59,040 --> 0:40:04,960
the UN is in town here in New York, and we are hearing about a commitment to vaccinate the world.

363
0:40:04,960 --> 0:40:12,480
It was announced Wednesday, September 21, 21, that the United States is doubling its purchase

364
0:40:12,480 --> 0:40:18,800
of Pfizer COVID-19 shots to share with the world, increasing this up to 1 billion doses,

365
0:40:19,520 --> 0:40:26,560
and there is a goal of vaccinating at least 70% of the global population within the next year.

366
0:40:26,560 --> 0:40:30,480
So on that note, I'll remind everyone through the months of August, September, October,

367
0:40:30,480 --> 0:40:36,240
donations made to parasites without borders will support floating doctors and all the great work

368
0:40:36,240 --> 0:40:42,080
they do down in Panama. So go to parasites without borders.com, click donate and help us and help

369
0:40:42,080 --> 0:40:50,320
us support them. Time for some email questions for Daniel. You can send yours to Daniel at microbe.tv.

370
0:40:50,320 --> 0:40:54,960
Jody writes, my cousin, a health care worker in Michigan, who was pregnant in her third trimester,

371
0:40:54,960 --> 0:41:01,520
wrote to ask for thoughts on whether to get a third shot of Pfizer. Her OB is all for it,

372
0:41:01,520 --> 0:41:06,720
but she was curious to know whether or not I had encountered any discussion or studies on the matter.

373
0:41:06,720 --> 0:41:12,720
I understand that pregnancy is an immunocompromised state and that pregnant women are at increased

374
0:41:12,720 --> 0:41:17,840
risk of developing severe symptoms. But I also remember learning that fever during a pregnancy

375
0:41:17,840 --> 0:41:23,280
can be harmful to the developing baby, and she could experience fever as a side effect after

376
0:41:23,280 --> 0:41:28,880
receiving the shot. Can you shed any light on this issue for us? Yeah, no, this is this is a great

377
0:41:28,880 --> 0:41:33,520
question. And and I think that, you know, one of the things about the meeting that was had on

378
0:41:33,520 --> 0:41:39,520
Friday and the decision was made this week, is they're not saying don't give boosters. Pfizer

379
0:41:39,520 --> 0:41:44,080
is a licensed vaccine. They're saying have this discussion with your provider. And so I'm going

380
0:41:44,080 --> 0:41:49,760
to encourage this individual to do that. So I'm going to speak more broadly on this topic. First

381
0:41:49,760 --> 0:41:55,200
off, kudos, you're in the 16% of pregnant women that have already gotten your two doses. I think

382
0:41:55,200 --> 0:42:01,200
that's fantastic. And that really, you know, the data would really say that that's the wise decision

383
0:42:01,200 --> 0:42:07,600
for her and her baby. But the third dose, you know, one of the big things that came out in the studies

384
0:42:08,160 --> 0:42:13,600
that were discussed last Friday was that individuals under the age of 40 under the age of 50 really

385
0:42:13,600 --> 0:42:19,360
continued to have really excellent protection. There's no compelling data that everyone across

386
0:42:19,360 --> 0:42:24,160
the board needs that third dose. We certainly have no compelling data that that third dose

387
0:42:24,160 --> 0:42:29,360
needs to be given across the board to pregnant women. So as a general, I will say the science

388
0:42:29,360 --> 0:42:35,120
does not necessarily push one to go forward with that third dose during pregnancy. And this would

389
0:42:35,120 --> 0:42:39,600
be one of those issues. We really are careful with vaccines. We really want to know the safety

390
0:42:39,600 --> 0:42:44,720
profile before we encourage people to do that. And right now we have great safety data on the

391
0:42:44,720 --> 0:42:52,160
two shots in pregnancy. We don't have the safety data on giving another dose. So have that conversation

392
0:42:52,160 --> 0:42:57,840
with the physician get all the facts make an informed decision. Marcy writes question about masks.

393
0:42:57,840 --> 0:43:03,120
Have you seen the singing masks? And what do you think of them for singing in a choir? All vaccinated,

394
0:43:03,120 --> 0:43:09,440
standing six feet apart in a very large open room, a church outdoors for part of rehearsal.

395
0:43:09,440 --> 0:43:17,120
Would face shields add anything? So I have not I am not familiar with the singing

396
0:43:17,120 --> 0:43:23,200
the singing mask. That said, are you familiar with the singing mask? No, I'm not familiar with that.

397
0:43:23,200 --> 0:43:27,440
But no, I mean, this is this is a creative it sounds very creative. I don't know what the data

398
0:43:27,440 --> 0:43:33,760
is on it, but it'd be interesting to see because yeah, people want to do the activities that they

399
0:43:33,760 --> 0:43:38,320
enjoy. Sometimes the singing is just singing because they love singing. I think there's some

400
0:43:38,320 --> 0:43:44,960
singers on in the Twiv co-hosts. There's also some people that enjoy playing instruments. I'm a

401
0:43:44,960 --> 0:43:48,640
flute player, by the way, because people didn't know that. So I'm trying to figure out how I can

402
0:43:48,640 --> 0:43:52,640
play a flute if I have to convert over to something made out of silver or copper. I don't have enough

403
0:43:52,640 --> 0:43:58,480
money to buy a silver flute. But so no, this sounds great and interesting. I'll have to look

404
0:43:58,480 --> 0:44:04,560
into that. Yeah, they look like masks with an extended front, right, with some kind of structure

405
0:44:04,560 --> 0:44:09,920
instead of sitting up against your face. So take a look. Yeah, it might make sense.

406
0:44:09,920 --> 0:44:14,880
Mike writes, trying to convince my 23 year old daughter to get vaccinated. She's hesitant.

407
0:44:15,440 --> 0:44:19,280
I think this is common in her age group. Not sure I can change your mind. I'm trying to point to

408
0:44:19,280 --> 0:44:25,040
some credible large scale data showing the efficacy, which I define as reduction in hospitalization,

409
0:44:25,040 --> 0:44:31,920
long COVID and death. The vaccines are all presented as having impressive 90% efficacy numbers.

410
0:44:31,920 --> 0:44:37,120
I tried to read the paper you mentioned in number 800, risk factors and disease profile of post

411
0:44:37,120 --> 0:44:45,040
vaccination infection in UK users of the COVID symptom study app. They reported 0.5% of the one

412
0:44:45,040 --> 0:44:50,560
dose vaccinated subsequently caught COVID 0.2% of the two dose. But I did not see the number

413
0:44:50,560 --> 0:44:56,160
of unvaccinated people in these data. Surely the number of cases in the UK unvaccinated population

414
0:44:56,160 --> 0:45:03,920
is known over the same period. Yeah, so this is I think a really important conversation that

415
0:45:03,920 --> 0:45:09,280
you're having. So keep having that conversation. The first thing to do is ask your daughter,

416
0:45:09,280 --> 0:45:14,880
listen, find out what's going on. I've had several conversations and people always apologize.

417
0:45:14,880 --> 0:45:18,720
I'm sorry, Dr. Griffin. I have a question. I know you're so busy. I'm never too busy to talk

418
0:45:18,720 --> 0:45:25,520
about vaccines. What are the risks? What are people worried about in their early 20s? I was

419
0:45:25,520 --> 0:45:31,680
talking to one of our case managers today who has a 25 24 year old daughter. It's a very close

420
0:45:31,680 --> 0:45:39,360
2324. Sometimes actually telling stories that have been shared with you or that you've talked

421
0:45:39,360 --> 0:45:45,920
to the person individually. And the story was here. Her 24 year old daughter got COVID and is still

422
0:45:45,920 --> 0:45:50,880
continuing to have this chest pain that wakes her up from night. We have individuals who have

423
0:45:50,880 --> 0:45:56,080
loss of smell. We have individuals when they lose their hair, we have individuals with long

424
0:45:56,080 --> 0:46:02,480
COVID and all those issues. Most people in their 20s are in their heads immortal. So they're not

425
0:46:02,480 --> 0:46:08,800
going to die. So the risk of death to them is not particularly persuasive. Ending up in the hospital

426
0:46:08,800 --> 0:46:14,560
is not really part of their worldview. But a lot of the other things we've learned about COVID

427
0:46:14,560 --> 0:46:20,960
is this young group, particularly, it looks like women more than men are at higher risk of a

428
0:46:20,960 --> 0:46:28,080
post acute sequelae of COVID lingering long term issues. Teeth have fallen out, hairs fallen out,

429
0:46:28,080 --> 0:46:33,920
fatigue, low energy, cognitive dysfunction, which we're now calling it instead of brain fog to

430
0:46:33,920 --> 0:46:39,360
recognize just how profound that can be the inability to exercise at the level where they could be

431
0:46:39,360 --> 0:46:44,080
for. So I think it's important to share and talk about these. How long will those things last to

432
0:46:44,080 --> 0:46:48,800
be completely honest? We only have about two years of data. So you could throw that in there,

433
0:46:48,800 --> 0:46:55,040
you may only feel crummy for one or two years, where we know the safety profile of the vaccines,

434
0:46:55,040 --> 0:47:00,480
incredibly safe, much lower risk of having any problem by getting vaccinated compared to all

435
0:47:00,480 --> 0:47:07,520
we've learned about this horrible virus. Robert writes, Dr. Griffin says he likes to emphasize

436
0:47:07,520 --> 0:47:12,480
to people that COVID is not a two week disease. The situation is more complicated than just getting

437
0:47:12,480 --> 0:47:17,520
COVID being sick for a couple of weeks and then getting better or not. If this is in fact the case,

438
0:47:17,520 --> 0:47:23,680
why is it that long COVID seems to be understood by the medical community as a sequelae to COVID-19?

439
0:47:23,680 --> 0:47:29,600
I think Dr. Griffin calls it a subset of packs rather than part of the acute disease process.

440
0:47:29,600 --> 0:47:35,680
Is the distinction meaningful or just semantic? Also, we've only had slightly less than two years

441
0:47:35,680 --> 0:47:43,120
experienced. This doesn't sound long to me, but then I'm 73. Yes, one day in my 70s, I will have

442
0:47:43,120 --> 0:47:49,680
that wisdom and patience that it sounds like you have developed. Yeah, we only have a certain

443
0:47:49,680 --> 0:47:55,200
period of time. So what are we talking about? And so when the NIH got together and they tried

444
0:47:55,200 --> 0:48:01,520
to defy what was going on, they came up with this term P-A-S-C or past post-acute sequelae of

445
0:48:01,520 --> 0:48:08,880
COVID. And what they were realizing and a colleague of mine, Sarah Dottie, published a paper with

446
0:48:08,880 --> 0:48:15,120
Ken Cohen and some others at UnitedHealth Group looking at individuals that got COVID. What happened

447
0:48:15,120 --> 0:48:21,840
to them over the next year? And we were seeing twice the incidence of new diagnosis of diabetes,

448
0:48:22,400 --> 0:48:27,040
fivefold increase risk of stroke, things like that. So we started to realize that there were a

449
0:48:27,040 --> 0:48:32,560
lot of sequelae, a lot of things that were happening to these individuals after COVID infection that

450
0:48:32,560 --> 0:48:37,200
weren't just what we're being described in these support groups. So it's sort of larger umbrella

451
0:48:37,200 --> 0:48:42,880
to understand what's going on. As a subset, we have individuals with this syndrome where they

452
0:48:42,880 --> 0:48:48,240
have fatigue, where they have cognitive dysfunction, where they have a chest pain, where they have

453
0:48:48,960 --> 0:48:52,560
headaches, nuanced headaches that they've never had before, a number of these other things that

454
0:48:52,560 --> 0:48:57,840
we sort of put together. And what we basically, it is meaningful for us as clinicians, but I think

455
0:48:57,840 --> 0:49:03,680
it's also meaningful for us living in this society, that there are individuals at four weeks who are

456
0:49:03,680 --> 0:49:08,000
not better. There's individuals that eight weeks who are not better. We now have individuals who

457
0:49:08,000 --> 0:49:14,640
got sick in March of 2020, who still are not well enough to return to their pre-illness

458
0:49:14,640 --> 0:49:20,000
employment. And a lot of our large employers are telling us that's still about 10% of their

459
0:49:20,000 --> 0:49:26,800
workforce. So I think this is really important. And I think it is meaningful. Will, at some point,

460
0:49:26,800 --> 0:49:31,360
these people get better. Some of them are getting better. That's true. By the time you get about

461
0:49:31,360 --> 0:49:38,160
one year out, a significant percent of these people have either improved or gotten better.

462
0:49:38,160 --> 0:49:43,040
But unfortunately, there's a residual, a fairly large residual, that have continued to suffer

463
0:49:43,040 --> 0:49:50,960
even 12 months, 18 months out. So Robert points out that I said on a recent podcast that there's

464
0:49:50,960 --> 0:49:57,440
no long polio, but he says there is post polio, where years after recovering from polio and

465
0:49:57,440 --> 0:50:04,000
regaining limb function, you start to lose it again. And so he points out that is what I think of as

466
0:50:04,000 --> 0:50:10,960
a sequelae, right? It happens. But it's not really long polio because you don't have a continuous

467
0:50:10,960 --> 0:50:16,000
set of symptoms as you do with with COVID. I mean, I know it's a distinction, but I think it's

468
0:50:16,000 --> 0:50:19,920
actually clinically different, don't you think? Yeah. And I think that's an important distinction

469
0:50:20,560 --> 0:50:26,880
that you make. And I was not that familiar in my training with post polio syndrome until I went

470
0:50:26,880 --> 0:50:32,640
out to Colorado. And I was working in an area that had been really hard hit with polio. And so I

471
0:50:32,640 --> 0:50:38,160
was taking care of a lot of individuals who were in their 50s, 60s, and older, who were on walkers

472
0:50:38,160 --> 0:50:42,000
who basically said they had polio when they were younger, they thought they'd made a complete

473
0:50:42,000 --> 0:50:48,240
recovery. But then when they got into their 50s, they had apparently lost enough reserve that they

474
0:50:48,240 --> 0:50:53,440
needed a walker, which I'm in my 50s. And so if I was needing a walker in my 50s, I would be

475
0:50:53,440 --> 0:50:58,400
quite shocked. So that is one of the things we worry about long term, what's going to happen?

476
0:50:58,400 --> 0:51:04,800
We know with COVID now, months 18 months out, what's going to happen two, three, five years.

477
0:51:04,800 --> 0:51:10,640
I do not expect it to be anything like the horrors of the post polio syndrome that we saw.

478
0:51:10,640 --> 0:51:12,960
But boy, there are plenty of horrors that we're seeing now.

479
0:51:13,920 --> 0:51:18,800
For any viral disease, you can often think of long term consequences. For example,

480
0:51:19,600 --> 0:51:28,080
West Nile neurological infection, you have cognitive and motor problems. Even mumps can have long

481
0:51:28,080 --> 0:51:36,560
term. In some boys, it would sterilize them. But it's not a continuous spectrum. Long COVID,

482
0:51:36,560 --> 0:51:39,040
I think is different, because as you say, it just doesn't stop.

483
0:51:40,400 --> 0:51:48,320
I would agree. That is COVID-19 clinical update number 81 with Dr. Daniel Griffin. Thank you, Daniel.

484
0:51:48,320 --> 0:51:59,360
Oh, thank you, and everyone be safe.
