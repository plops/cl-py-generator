This week in virology, the podcast about viruses, the kind that make you sick.

2
0:00:10,400 --> 0:00:20,400
From Microbe TV, this is Twiv. This week in virology, Episode 778, recorded on July 8, 2021.

3
0:00:20,400 --> 0:00:27,200
I'm Vincent Raccoon, hello. And you're listening to the podcast all about viruses. Joining me today

4
0:00:27,200 --> 0:00:34,720
from New York, Daniel Griffin. Hello, everyone. So I understand that we have a slight uptick in

5
0:00:34,720 --> 0:00:39,040
cases in the U.S. due to a few states where there are a lot of unvaccinated people.

6
0:00:40,320 --> 0:00:44,960
Vincent, Vincent, have you left the echo chamber? It's the Delta variants, of course.

7
0:00:44,960 --> 0:00:51,440
Oh, I forgot. Nothing says nothing to do with a lack of vaccination, a lack of masking,

8
0:00:52,160 --> 0:00:55,840
nothing to do with human behavior. It's all the virus. We're all doing the right things.

9
0:00:55,840 --> 0:01:03,360
Got it. Got it. No, I have to say, I think I went through stages of frustration and I've

10
0:01:03,360 --> 0:01:07,840
sort of come out the other side earlier today. I was listening. It's actually Carl Zimmer,

11
0:01:07,840 --> 0:01:13,760
right? Talking about how he's welcoming people into the Delta Club. He knew this was coming.

12
0:01:13,760 --> 0:01:19,120
It would be the end of the world. And Vincent, when you say it's exactly true, you look at a map

13
0:01:19,120 --> 0:01:27,920
and where people did not get vaccinated, they're getting COVID. But the hospitalizations and deaths

14
0:01:27,920 --> 0:01:34,880
are not going up, right? I don't understand. No. That is something that I was doing to talk

15
0:01:34,880 --> 0:01:41,040
yesterday, actually talking about what is the story with the Delta variant? What is this concept

16
0:01:41,040 --> 0:01:47,360
of transmissibility? And actually, I will tell everyone a little shame that I didn't get with

17
0:01:47,360 --> 0:01:56,960
777, but I did really enjoy to have 777. And I think it's important because sloppy language,

18
0:01:57,600 --> 0:02:02,800
I think puts us all at risk because there's this concept, right? I did sort of a thought

19
0:02:02,800 --> 0:02:06,960
experiment in this talk I did yesterday. I said, what does transmission mean to you?

20
0:02:07,840 --> 0:02:11,600
And then I had asked some people before the show. And one of them was like, well, I heard

21
0:02:11,600 --> 0:02:16,880
it's so transmissible that two people were walking in the street and one person walked

22
0:02:16,880 --> 0:02:22,400
by the other and got COVID. I'm like, let's be honest, they were having an affair. I mean,

23
0:02:25,280 --> 0:02:29,360
so, you know, and I think then people start, oh, the masks don't even work. Why do I bother?

24
0:02:29,360 --> 0:02:35,120
The vaccines don't work. Why do I bother? And the reality is, is that, yeah, there is a fitness

25
0:02:35,120 --> 0:02:40,320
advantage to the Delta variant. That's fine. We keep seeing different variants. And, you know,

26
0:02:40,320 --> 0:02:46,640
no one ever sort of raised the specter with flus in past years. So I'm not sure why science is be

27
0:02:46,640 --> 0:02:53,840
damned during times of COVID, but I'm sure we'll get into that. But no, I mean, the vaccines,

28
0:02:53,840 --> 0:02:58,720
as we'll talk about continue to be very effective. Areas with excellent vaccination coverage have

29
0:02:58,720 --> 0:03:03,120
low rates, areas like Nevada, Missouri, other areas where they're not getting vaccinated,

30
0:03:03,760 --> 0:03:08,560
lots of COVID. But we're not seeing, you know, suddenly, if you look at the numbers across the

31
0:03:08,560 --> 0:03:13,680
country, we're not seeing suddenly that the hospitals are getting full again. It's all regional,

32
0:03:13,680 --> 0:03:17,840
it all corresponds to poor vaccine uptake. Our quotation will hit right onto this.

33
0:03:18,480 --> 0:03:24,880
It may be said that natural selection is daily and hourly scrutinizing throughout the world.

34
0:03:24,880 --> 0:03:30,640
Every variation, even the slightest rejecting that which is bad, preserving and adding up all

35
0:03:30,640 --> 0:03:38,320
that is good, silently and insensibly working. And that's right out of on the origin of species

36
0:03:38,320 --> 0:03:44,240
by Charles Darwin. And I would say it's good. You want to quote Charles Darwin right out of his

37
0:03:44,240 --> 0:03:50,080
writing because there are so many misquotes, Darwin out there. Some of them even etched in

38
0:03:50,080 --> 0:03:56,560
marble that were never said by Charles Darwin. But now I know that when we do science communication,

39
0:03:57,200 --> 0:04:04,320
people think that the intelligence level of the genuine population is about fifth grade level or

40
0:04:04,320 --> 0:04:09,040
such. But I don't think that's true, particularly the Twiv audience. I think people can understand

41
0:04:09,600 --> 0:04:14,400
survival of the fittest and the concepts that the viruses are competing against

42
0:04:15,440 --> 0:04:24,480
themselves. And we are just behaving poorly. But okay, children, COVID and mental health,

43
0:04:24,480 --> 0:04:28,080
as I like to say, children are at low risk, but they are not at no risk.

44
0:04:28,080 --> 0:04:35,440
A really nice discussion. I think people are realizing COVID is becoming endemic. So really,

45
0:04:35,440 --> 0:04:42,800
the selection of parent and adolescent is making is what is the risk of vaccination versus what is

46
0:04:42,800 --> 0:04:49,920
the risk of eventually getting COVID. And really nice conversations having yesterday with a colleague

47
0:04:49,920 --> 0:04:56,160
of mine, Michael Amala, just about there may be an increased incidence of cardiac inflammation

48
0:04:56,160 --> 0:05:03,520
after vaccination. This in no way compares to the incredibly high incidence and severity that we see

49
0:05:04,160 --> 0:05:11,280
when these kids actually get COVID. All right, so let's move to transmission, pre-exposure period

50
0:05:11,280 --> 0:05:17,680
transmission. Still never miss an opportunity to test. We're falling down quite a bit on this.

51
0:05:19,040 --> 0:05:24,880
But one of the things I get a lot of questions about, and we had a nice MMWR early release about

52
0:05:24,880 --> 0:05:33,440
this, is what about these air purifiers? And the early release entitled efficacy of portable air

53
0:05:33,440 --> 0:05:41,040
cleaners and masking for reducing indoor exposure to simulated exhaled SARS-CoV-2 aerosols,

54
0:05:41,040 --> 0:05:48,240
United States 2021. Now, I have to say, this sounds like it was a fun project. So let me go

55
0:05:48,240 --> 0:05:56,160
through what the authors did. The authors reported using a breathing aerosol source simulator to

56
0:05:56,160 --> 0:06:01,440
mimic a meeting participant, exhaling infectious particles. That was the source. And then there

57
0:06:01,440 --> 0:06:07,760
were three breathing simulators used to mimic a speaker, two participants exposed to these aerosol

58
0:06:07,760 --> 0:06:12,080
particles. And interestingly enough, these simulators were actually head forms with

59
0:06:12,080 --> 0:06:21,120
elastomeric skin from Hanson Robotics used to use to do these experiments. They set them up,

60
0:06:22,160 --> 0:06:27,600
set to either 15 liters per minute or 28 liters per minute. And then they use these optical particle

61
0:06:27,600 --> 0:06:32,880
counters to collect aerosol particles. There's a figure in the paper, but I have to say,

62
0:06:32,880 --> 0:06:37,440
I wanted to see the video. I'm going to have to admit, this must have been cool. And they did

63
0:06:37,440 --> 0:06:43,680
report that based upon this investigation, using two HEPA air cleaners close to the aerosol source,

64
0:06:43,680 --> 0:06:50,640
reduced the aerosol exposure of the uninfected participants and speaker by up to 65% and a

65
0:06:50,640 --> 0:06:56,400
combination of the HEPA air filters and universal masking reduced exposures by up to 90%.

66
0:06:57,760 --> 0:07:02,240
But there's a few comments. I mean, this is a big topic, but a few comments. First,

67
0:07:02,240 --> 0:07:10,160
just this was really a simulated basically air cleaning procedure. There's no SARS-CoV-2

68
0:07:10,160 --> 0:07:15,120
in this paper. This paper actually doesn't really tell us anything about the actual

69
0:07:15,120 --> 0:07:21,760
transmission of SARS-CoV-2. It just tells us about how you might keep droplet particles aerosols

70
0:07:21,760 --> 0:07:27,680
out of the air. So I think that's important. When people ask me about the HEPA air cleaners,

71
0:07:27,680 --> 0:07:35,120
I say sounds great. There's no magic barrier at six feet. So you get in that suburban home

72
0:07:35,120 --> 0:07:40,160
with poor airflow, you get in that office, you start getting a lot of people in there. And I think

73
0:07:40,160 --> 0:07:45,120
that it's reasonable to consider these air purifiers, reasonable to open those windows.

74
0:07:46,160 --> 0:07:51,200
Your wrist does not go to zero when you hit six feet. So this is interesting, but

75
0:07:51,200 --> 0:07:56,000
realize I've seen a lot of retweets of this, look, we've been saying this forever. I'm not sure

76
0:07:56,000 --> 0:08:00,960
what you've been saying forever. This just tells you that air filters do filter the air.

77
0:08:01,840 --> 0:08:07,920
All right. Active vaccination. Never miss an opportunity to vaccinate. And vaccination is how

78
0:08:07,920 --> 0:08:13,600
this pandemic ends. And we are seeing that across the country. So last week, I talked about the

79
0:08:13,600 --> 0:08:21,840
preprint serum neutralizing antibody of mRNA 1273 against SARS-CoV-2 variants. That's the Moderna

80
0:08:21,840 --> 0:08:27,360
vaccine. And this suggested that the Moderna mRNA vaccine produced antibody levels with neutralized

81
0:08:27,360 --> 0:08:34,400
activity against several SARS-CoV-2 variants, including the Delta variant. I also mentioned

82
0:08:34,400 --> 0:08:40,800
the data from the UK suggesting the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine 88% effective against symptomatic

83
0:08:40,800 --> 0:08:48,000
disease from from the Delta variant, then the AstraZeneca about 60%. This week, we had some

84
0:08:48,000 --> 0:08:58,400
data on the J&J vaccine in the form of the preprint, add 26, COVID-2, S elicited neutralizing

85
0:08:58,400 --> 0:09:05,040
activity against Delta and other SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. So similar to the Moderna

86
0:09:05,040 --> 0:09:13,360
preprint, the authors tested Sierra from recipients who'd gotten a single dose of the J&J. This is

87
0:09:13,360 --> 0:09:20,880
the J&J vaccine. They tested the Sierra for neutralizing activity against several SARS-CoV-2

88
0:09:20,880 --> 0:09:29,840
variants. All tested variants demonstrated susceptibility to the induced serum neutralization,

89
0:09:29,840 --> 0:09:37,200
albeit there was reduction compared to the B1 strain. Most pronounced reduction was observed

90
0:09:37,200 --> 0:09:46,880
for the beta. That was about 3.6. The gamma, that was 3.4. Now, there was only a 1.6-fold reduction

91
0:09:46,880 --> 0:09:53,520
observed for the widely spreading Delta variant. A couple comments here. This work was done using

92
0:09:53,520 --> 0:10:00,800
pseudotyped virus. And again, this is looking at antibodies, right? This is not looking at T cells.

93
0:10:00,800 --> 0:10:06,720
This is also not giving us real world experience as far as the ability of the J&J vaccine to

94
0:10:06,720 --> 0:10:13,440
reduce our chance of getting sick, to reduce our chance of getting infected. But I do know,

95
0:10:13,440 --> 0:10:18,720
I get lots of questions. We got all these people wanting to top off their immunity after J&J

96
0:10:18,720 --> 0:10:26,240
with an mRNA vaccine. This does not support that. That is not currently recommended. If anything,

97
0:10:26,800 --> 0:10:31,680
this would give people, I think, maybe a little bit of confidence that even just looking at the

98
0:10:31,680 --> 0:10:37,840
antibody levels, and we really think that J&J's power is in a T cell response, that we're maybe

99
0:10:37,840 --> 0:10:44,320
better off from a J&J standpoint with a circulating Delta relative to the gamma or the beta.

100
0:10:45,600 --> 0:10:52,080
Now, last week, I also discussed effect of vaccination on household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in England.

101
0:10:52,960 --> 0:10:58,240
And that was where they reported that vaccination was associated without a 40 to 50% reduction in

102
0:10:58,240 --> 0:11:05,360
transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in household context. But as Vincent brought up, most of the vaccinated

103
0:11:05,360 --> 0:11:12,560
index patients in this data set, 93% had only gotten the first dose of vaccine. I know when I

104
0:11:12,560 --> 0:11:17,120
discuss my wife with this with my wife, her comment was, well, that's useless. Well, remember,

105
0:11:17,680 --> 0:11:23,760
this was the UK. There had been a significant period of time where people had only gotten one dose.

106
0:11:23,760 --> 0:11:31,600
So we're hoping that after a second dose that that reduction is even more. So I just want to

107
0:11:31,600 --> 0:11:36,720
point that out. But we did get a little more information in this realm. The New England Journal

108
0:11:36,720 --> 0:11:48,720
of Medicine had a paper, prevention and attenuation of COVID-19 with BNT 162B2 and mRNA 1273 vaccines.

109
0:11:48,720 --> 0:11:54,880
So this is the Pfizer BioNTech and the Moderna vaccine. And I think this paper is also helping

110
0:11:54,880 --> 0:12:01,280
to build the story that people who get vaccinated not only are protected themselves, but there may

111
0:12:01,280 --> 0:12:09,360
be an impact on interrupting transmission. So these were a number of participants. They

112
0:12:09,360 --> 0:12:16,160
excluded participants with laboratory documentation of SARS-CoV-2 infection prior to the start of

113
0:12:16,160 --> 0:12:23,920
the study. And then they went ahead and conducted a prospective cohort study on 3975 health care

114
0:12:23,920 --> 0:12:29,760
personnel, first responders and other essential and frontline workers. And they looked from December

115
0:12:29,760 --> 0:12:37,440
14, 2020 to April 10, 2021. And I mean, I have to say, this is great. The participants completed

116
0:12:37,440 --> 0:12:47,360
weekly SARS-CoV-2 testing, mid-terminate nasal swabs for qualitative and quantitative PCR testing.

117
0:12:47,920 --> 0:12:58,320
Now 796 or 20% of these individuals were completely unvaccinated. About 636 had received

118
0:12:58,320 --> 0:13:05,680
at least one dose. 2543 had gotten two doses. And they report that they detected SARS-CoV-2

119
0:13:05,680 --> 0:13:14,880
infection in five of those that were fully vaccinated, 11 partially vaccinated, 156 unvaccinated.

120
0:13:14,880 --> 0:13:19,120
And I remember different denominators down. So I break this down into what percent are we looking

121
0:13:19,120 --> 0:13:28,640
at. About 0.2% of the fully vaccinated, 1.7% of the partially vaccinated, 20% of the unvaccinated

122
0:13:28,640 --> 0:13:37,120
got infected. So you're about 100 times less likely to get infected, about a two-log reduction

123
0:13:37,120 --> 0:13:44,000
in even testing positive after the vaccination. They then went one step further to look at the

124
0:13:44,000 --> 0:13:51,760
level of the viral mRNA, right? Not actually looking at live or infectious or active virus,

125
0:13:51,760 --> 0:13:57,440
but looking at viral mRNA. And they also looked at the duration at which you can detect this.

126
0:13:57,440 --> 0:14:05,120
In the vaccinated, their data showed lower levels of viral RNA and a lower percentage of individuals

127
0:14:05,120 --> 0:14:12,480
still had detectable viral RNA for greater than one week. So I think this is compelling, right?

128
0:14:13,120 --> 0:14:17,520
This is data showing that people who are vaccinated are less likely to get infected.

129
0:14:18,080 --> 0:14:23,200
I always point out that if you can't get infected, you can't spread it to others. Also

130
0:14:23,200 --> 0:14:29,280
suggesting, as we've seen, that if you do get infected after vaccination, it looks like there's

131
0:14:29,280 --> 0:14:36,320
less viral RNA. Also looks like that is present detectable for a shorter period of time.

132
0:14:37,200 --> 0:14:43,360
Now, one of the big things that keeps coming up, right, is what is your sort of altruistic,

133
0:14:44,240 --> 0:14:49,440
your civic virtue to getting vaccinated. And so I'm going to share a story because I think if

134
0:14:49,440 --> 0:14:54,160
people think these things through, let me say, yeah, I guess I should get vaccinated. And this was a

135
0:14:54,160 --> 0:15:00,080
call I got on Thursday evening. And the story was it was a three-year-old. I got the call from the

136
0:15:00,080 --> 0:15:05,920
grandparents who are physicians. This three-year-old, most of the pandemic isolated in the home,

137
0:15:05,920 --> 0:15:12,800
now has the opportunity to go off to a daycap. And the mom's excited. She's pregnant, has another

138
0:15:12,800 --> 0:15:17,760
child under the age of 10 as well. And on Thursday morning, everyone's ready for the

139
0:15:17,760 --> 0:15:22,480
July 4th exciting weekend. There could be the two sisters, the grandparents, the two grandchildren.

140
0:15:23,200 --> 0:15:29,040
The three-year-old starts to feel not well. Sort of runny nose, and they get a call that morning

141
0:15:29,040 --> 0:15:35,200
from the camp. I'm sorry, but the camp counselor that has been taking care of your three-year-old

142
0:15:35,200 --> 0:15:43,200
just called us to let us know that they have COVID. Unvaccinated camp counselor, the three-year-old

143
0:15:43,200 --> 0:15:50,000
gets tested, and the three-year-old has COVID. So let's look at the impact of that counselor's

144
0:15:50,000 --> 0:15:55,680
decision to not get vaccinated and work around children. So that counselor transmitted the virus

145
0:15:55,680 --> 0:16:01,200
to the three-year-old. We now have a pregnant woman at home with a six-year-old. We have a

146
0:16:01,200 --> 0:16:06,480
three-year-old who's got COVID, who now can't go back to camp. Finally, had had some social

147
0:16:06,480 --> 0:16:11,440
interaction. The six-year-old is in quarantine. So the six-year-old can't go to camp.

148
0:16:11,440 --> 0:16:16,720
The pregnant woman's sister had come out for the four-day weekend to all be together.

149
0:16:16,720 --> 0:16:24,480
She leaves immediately. The two grandparents leave. What a disaster. So just think about the fact,

150
0:16:24,480 --> 0:16:29,200
our decisions affect our community. They affect others. If you're going to work around young,

151
0:16:29,200 --> 0:16:36,080
unvaccinated vulnerable children or other vulnerable populations, your decisions don't just affect

152
0:16:36,080 --> 0:16:42,240
you. They affect others. And I think this is just sort of a story about how that person's decision

153
0:16:42,960 --> 0:16:47,440
really had a significant impact. So let's think about that when we make our decisions.

154
0:16:47,440 --> 0:16:52,800
All right. The period of detectable viral replication, the viral symptom phase,

155
0:16:53,600 --> 0:16:57,200
the time for monitoring and monoclonals. I like to say where you get your test is

156
0:16:57,200 --> 0:17:03,040
ideally where you should get your monoclonals. And I have to say, anticipate in the next couple

157
0:17:03,040 --> 0:17:08,480
months. I'm very optimistic we're going to have some exciting small molecule inhibitor results.

158
0:17:09,440 --> 0:17:15,360
Sort of an option going into the fall and winter when we will still have COVID-19.

159
0:17:16,000 --> 0:17:20,480
But some less exciting data on ivermectin with the publication of the paper.

160
0:17:20,480 --> 0:17:26,560
ivermectin to prevent hospitalization in patients with COVID-19. ivercorre COVID-19,

161
0:17:26,560 --> 0:17:33,760
a randomized double blind placebo control trial in BMC infectious diseases. So a lot of people

162
0:17:33,760 --> 0:17:39,200
were waiting for this. This was nicknamed the Corientis trial. This was a randomized double

163
0:17:39,200 --> 0:17:46,240
blind placebo controlled study conducted in non hospitalized individuals with COVID-19

164
0:17:46,240 --> 0:17:55,600
in Corientes, Argentina. So patients with SARS-CoV-2, positive nasal swabs were contacted within 48

165
0:17:55,600 --> 0:18:01,040
hours of that positive test by telephone to invite them to participate. The trial then

166
0:18:01,040 --> 0:18:10,080
randomized 501 patients between August 19, 2020 and February 22, 2021. The patients were

167
0:18:10,080 --> 0:18:16,720
randomized to receive ivermectin. It was a weight-based dosing with an N of 250, the placebo N of

168
0:18:16,720 --> 0:18:26,080
251. This treatment was for two days with this weight-based. The efficacy of ivermectin to prevent

169
0:18:26,080 --> 0:18:33,440
hospitalizations was evaluated as the primary outcome. The mean age was 42 years and the mean

170
0:18:33,440 --> 0:18:38,720
time since symptom onset to inclusion was four days, right? So this was actually quite early.

171
0:18:39,680 --> 0:18:45,680
The primary outcome of hospitalization was met in 5.6 percent of the individuals in the ivermectin

172
0:18:45,680 --> 0:18:54,800
group, 8.4 percent in the placebo group. The p value on this difference was 0.227. Time to

173
0:18:54,800 --> 0:18:59,840
hospitalization was not statistically different between the groups. The mean time from study

174
0:18:59,840 --> 0:19:07,600
enrollment to invasive mechanic, ventilatory support was 5.25 days in the ivermectin, 10 days

175
0:19:07,600 --> 0:19:14,080
in the placebo group. That actually, interesting enough, was statistically significant. People in

176
0:19:14,080 --> 0:19:20,720
the ivermectin group, on average, ended up on a mechanical ventilation in about five days versus

177
0:19:20,720 --> 0:19:29,920
10 days in placebo. That's a p value of 0.019. I know there's a lot of people who are really

178
0:19:29,920 --> 0:19:36,880
passionate about ivermectin. There's this buzz that's a crime against humanity that not everyone

179
0:19:36,880 --> 0:19:42,640
is getting ivermectin. But I have to say, so far, we are not seeing the science to support that

180
0:19:42,640 --> 0:19:50,480
degree of excitement. At this point, still, we're not recommending use of ivermectin outside of

181
0:19:50,480 --> 0:19:57,040
clinical trials. If anything, I think this also gives us a boundary of how potentially effective

182
0:19:57,040 --> 0:20:03,760
ivermectin could possibly be if we have a larger powered study. So, put that in context. I'm sure

183
0:20:03,760 --> 0:20:09,920
I will get some fairly friendly constructive comments. All right, the early inflammatory phase.

184
0:20:09,920 --> 0:20:17,760
The publication, association between administration of IL-6 antagonist and mortality among patients

185
0:20:17,760 --> 0:20:24,800
hospitalized for COVID-19, a meta-analysis. And this is out of React, right? So, that is the WHO,

186
0:20:24,800 --> 0:20:31,520
rapid evidence appraisal for COVID-19 therapies, the React working group. And there's a couple of

187
0:20:31,520 --> 0:20:36,560
these, right? I think I've shared that I sit on the American Society of Hematology working group

188
0:20:36,560 --> 0:20:41,920
working group, looking at anticoagulation, a number of individuals sit on this WHO group.

189
0:20:41,920 --> 0:20:46,560
And what they're doing is they're looking at data that we have. Actually, there's a lot of

190
0:20:46,560 --> 0:20:51,040
communication even ahead of time with the researchers prior to things being published.

191
0:20:51,680 --> 0:20:58,240
This paper was published in JAMA and just reinforces the role in select patients of IL-6

192
0:20:58,240 --> 0:21:03,440
antagonist therapy, right? So, this is tosy, tosyllismat that we've talked about.

193
0:21:03,440 --> 0:21:12,800
This was a prospective meta-analysis of 27 randomized trials, including 10,930 patients of whom

194
0:21:12,800 --> 0:21:21,840
2,565 died by 28 days. The 28-day all-course mortality was lower among patients who received

195
0:21:21,840 --> 0:21:28,640
the IL-6 antagonists compared with those who received usual care or placebo. But I want to break

196
0:21:28,640 --> 0:21:33,280
down because I think this is really critical and I want our listeners to catch this. The summary

197
0:21:33,280 --> 0:21:40,320
odds ratio for the Association of IL-6 antagonist treatment with 28-day all-course mortality

198
0:21:40,320 --> 0:21:50,320
was 0.78, so a 22% reduction with concomitant administration of corticosteroids. It was 1.09,

199
0:21:50,320 --> 0:21:56,400
so about a 9% increase in mortality if the patients did not get corticosteroids.

200
0:21:56,400 --> 0:22:02,640
So, I think this really enforces this paradigm now in a lot of our treatment guidelines.

201
0:22:03,600 --> 0:22:10,160
Patient comes to the hospital. Their oxygen saturation is less than 94%. We start them on

202
0:22:10,160 --> 0:22:16,160
steroids. They progress to a higher level of oxygen requirement. Then we look at adding the IL-6

203
0:22:16,160 --> 0:22:22,400
antagonist tosyllismab. If you do not give them steroids, do not give them tosyllismab. This is

204
0:22:22,400 --> 0:22:27,920
not a treatment for everyone. It's a select group. If they escalate to that higher level of oxygen,

205
0:22:27,920 --> 0:22:32,960
you have a window of only about 48 hours to jump on board. If you wait to day three,

206
0:22:32,960 --> 0:22:38,240
we actually see that we make things worse. This should be done with someone who knows these

207
0:22:38,240 --> 0:22:46,800
fine details. The tail phase long COVID. This, I have to say, was the excitement of my week. I

208
0:22:46,800 --> 0:22:53,120
really enjoyed seeing this Lancet preprint, the impact of COVID-19 vaccination on symptoms of

209
0:22:53,120 --> 0:23:01,120
long COVID, an international survey of people with lived experience of long COVID. Now, the authors

210
0:23:01,120 --> 0:23:08,560
invited patients with long COVID to complete a web-based questionnaire. 900 people were invited

211
0:23:08,560 --> 0:23:14,000
to participate, and several were excluded for different reasons. So, ultimately, we end up

212
0:23:14,000 --> 0:23:23,360
analyzing 812 individuals. Following vaccination, 57.9% of participants reported improvement in

213
0:23:23,360 --> 0:23:32,720
symptoms. 17.9% reported that they felt worse. 22.2% said they were really just about the same.

214
0:23:33,760 --> 0:23:37,200
And there was considerable individual variation in these responses.

215
0:23:37,200 --> 0:23:43,760
A larger improvement in symptom severity were seen in those who received the mRNA vaccines

216
0:23:43,760 --> 0:23:50,640
compared to the adenoviral vector vaccines. So, this is the UK. So, sort of think about that,

217
0:23:50,640 --> 0:23:58,640
a few comments. Since this was the UK, only 130 of these individuals had received a second dose of

218
0:23:58,640 --> 0:24:05,280
vaccine. So, here, we're actually seeing a 57.9% of participants reporting improvement after just

219
0:24:05,280 --> 0:24:10,320
a single dose of vaccine. And I think I've shared that a lot of us have had the experience that we

220
0:24:10,320 --> 0:24:17,040
pick up more responders with a second dose. This was an online survey, right? So, it recruited

221
0:24:17,040 --> 0:24:22,720
participants via social media and is not really representative of the entire population of people

222
0:24:22,720 --> 0:24:28,720
with long COVID. Most of the respondents identified as white. And by most, I mean over 90%.

223
0:24:28,720 --> 0:24:37,280
Over 80% were female. There was no control group here. I will say that there was a great

224
0:24:37,280 --> 0:24:42,320
figure two. And I want people to hopefully be linked to on the Parasites Without Borders website,

225
0:24:42,320 --> 0:24:47,920
right? And you can go to this right after you donate. But there's a great figure two. And figure

226
0:24:47,920 --> 0:24:51,840
two is nice to look at, well, what is getting better? Because people always ask me that. Is there

227
0:24:51,840 --> 0:24:58,400
a profile of who gets better? We saw individuals with fatigue, reporting improved fatigue,

228
0:24:58,400 --> 0:25:04,560
brain fog improved, my algaes improved, shortness of breath improved, insomnia improved,

229
0:25:05,360 --> 0:25:10,320
chest pain, a lot of these individuals says ongoing chest pain, that improved or resolved,

230
0:25:10,320 --> 0:25:15,920
gastrointestinal symptoms, maybe underappreciated earlier in the pandemic. A lot of these individuals

231
0:25:15,920 --> 0:25:23,520
have ongoing reflux, diarrhea, discomfort that improves. The inability to smell interesting

232
0:25:23,520 --> 0:25:28,800
after seeing improvement after vaccination, the autonomic dysfunction, the pot that we've all

233
0:25:28,800 --> 0:25:34,320
heard about, even these individuals that have chronic cough, fever, rash or other vascular issues.

234
0:25:34,320 --> 0:25:41,760
So the authors comment a little bit about the fact that there was no control group. They do

235
0:25:41,760 --> 0:25:46,240
point out that the majority of patients had been experienced as symptoms for at least nine months

236
0:25:46,240 --> 0:25:52,080
when they enrolled them. And there was a return to baseline for at least half of the patients

237
0:25:52,080 --> 0:25:58,160
within one month of vaccination. So there's a nice sort of timing here suggesting that

238
0:25:58,160 --> 0:26:03,680
for the majority of long COVID patients receiving a vaccination not only offers protection against

239
0:26:04,320 --> 0:26:11,200
reinfection, but also may potentially improve their symptoms. So all right, I will finish there

240
0:26:11,200 --> 0:26:17,440
today. And just remind everyone throughout the months of May, June and July, we're in July already.

241
0:26:17,440 --> 0:26:22,080
I was shocked that we've already gotten there. We are going to continue to take your donations.

242
0:26:22,080 --> 0:26:25,920
We're going to match them. We're going to continue to help Foundation International Medical Relief

243
0:26:25,920 --> 0:26:31,040
of Children. And I think one thing that is maybe clear to everyone, as good as things are getting

244
0:26:31,040 --> 0:26:36,160
in parts of the United States, you look at areas like Sub-Saharan Africa, only about one or two

245
0:26:36,160 --> 0:26:40,800
percent of those individuals even have access to vaccines. Here are all these discussions in the

246
0:26:40,800 --> 0:26:48,400
US. Should I get a third dose? Should I top off my J&J? Just remember, so many parts of the world,

247
0:26:48,400 --> 0:26:53,200
they don't even have access to that first dose. And we want to work with these groups and try to

248
0:26:53,200 --> 0:26:57,440
help support them so they can get back in these areas, help with the vaccine rollout. And you can

249
0:26:57,440 --> 0:27:02,480
be part of that. So thank you. Time for some email questions for Daniel. You can send yours to

250
0:27:02,480 --> 0:27:11,360
Daniel at microbe.tv. Carrie from Southern California has arranged monoclonal antibody treatment for

251
0:27:11,360 --> 0:27:19,120
over 40 patients in the last two months. But there are still high risk patients who are eligible.

252
0:27:19,840 --> 0:27:27,120
However, resources in his area have been reprioritized. And the monoclonal infusing clinic is being

253
0:27:27,120 --> 0:27:32,480
closed with referral of high risk patients to community sites. But the problem is we haven't found

254
0:27:32,480 --> 0:27:38,240
any. The HHS and Regeneron websites have extensive lists of Regeneron-Covian fusion sites. But every

255
0:27:38,240 --> 0:27:43,040
one of them in our area have ceased operation. County and state funding appears to be drying up.

256
0:27:43,040 --> 0:27:48,320
There don't seem to be any alternatives for patients in our community. If you found a similar

257
0:27:48,320 --> 0:27:54,240
problem in your area, are there any national efforts to allow continued treatment with monoclonals?

258
0:27:54,240 --> 0:27:59,600
I'm interested in your thoughts. Thanks for all you do. Yeah, I mean, that's disturbing,

259
0:27:59,600 --> 0:28:05,040
disheartening, I have to say. I was actually just on the phone earlier today with Adam Fitterstein.

260
0:28:05,040 --> 0:28:08,560
He's the head of our pro-health urgent care. He's just talking, are they having any issues?

261
0:28:08,560 --> 0:28:14,480
So I always try to keep this on my radar. We're very fortunate. We continue to be very fortunate

262
0:28:14,480 --> 0:28:20,800
in the New York Tri-State area. Our partners, the Catholic hospitals, you can send an individual

263
0:28:20,800 --> 0:28:25,760
right over. A few hours later, they're on their way home having already received their monoclonals.

264
0:28:25,760 --> 0:28:31,760
The large healthcare system northwell is jumping in with their tents as well. We really have good

265
0:28:31,760 --> 0:28:36,960
access here locally. But what you're saying is actually, I've heard that this is starting to

266
0:28:36,960 --> 0:28:42,320
be a problem nationally. There's no profit here, right? We live in a capitalist society.

267
0:28:42,320 --> 0:28:47,200
The number of COVID cases are dropping down. A lot of people are returning to business as usual.

268
0:28:47,200 --> 0:28:51,840
There isn't this huge demand for monoclonals in many parts of the country. There certainly

269
0:28:51,840 --> 0:28:59,120
should be in some others. Yeah, this is a problem. I remember in my previous incarnation, I spent

270
0:28:59,120 --> 0:29:04,560
some time in Washington actually training lobbyists. I can believe that. And one of the things is,

271
0:29:04,560 --> 0:29:09,760
you've got to create in a capitalist society a model that really makes people encouraged to

272
0:29:09,760 --> 0:29:13,280
do this. I hate to say that, right? We should all just do this because it's the right thing.

273
0:29:13,280 --> 0:29:20,080
But these medicines, the Regeneron products are bought by the government. Maybe you can charge

274
0:29:20,080 --> 0:29:26,400
into infusion, but there really isn't a big market driver to get this done. So they continue to be

275
0:29:26,400 --> 0:29:32,960
one of our most effective, if not our only most effective during that first week. We're lucky in

276
0:29:32,960 --> 0:29:37,680
the New York state area. But yeah, this is a problem. And hopefully the word people are listening,

277
0:29:37,680 --> 0:29:43,200
and we can get this addressed. So Darcy writes about an experience with his first asterism

278
0:29:43,200 --> 0:29:49,600
zenika jab. He has had a prior history of anaphylaxis to contrast agents used during an MRI scan.

279
0:29:50,880 --> 0:29:54,800
Initially, he was okay, but had an arrhythmia bad enough to need the emergency room,

280
0:29:55,440 --> 0:30:00,000
and had had several synths taking me there since each time discharged with no insights.

281
0:30:00,000 --> 0:30:05,120
While I had a history of palpitations and some arrhythmia is nothing significant for years,

282
0:30:05,120 --> 0:30:09,120
could be entirely coincidental that it happened within five days of my first jab.

283
0:30:09,120 --> 0:30:13,520
I'm awaiting a variety of tests to see what might be going on. But in the meantime,

284
0:30:13,520 --> 0:30:20,000
I kept getting contacted about my second and now overdue AstraZeneca jab. The doc told me not to

285
0:30:20,000 --> 0:30:25,840
get the second one until I had some cardio investigations, but with the Delta variant and

286
0:30:25,840 --> 0:30:30,880
pressure from social and familiar sources to be fully vaccinated. I wonder if you can comment on

287
0:30:30,880 --> 0:30:35,920
your experiences regarding arrhythmias and COVID vaccination, whether a second jab could

288
0:30:35,920 --> 0:30:40,960
exacerbate arrhythmia symptoms. There's several things here, and this is a great,

289
0:30:40,960 --> 0:30:46,960
great email, great question. What we are doing in the US, if someone had an issue with one

290
0:30:46,960 --> 0:30:51,200
vaccination, and here it will be, let's say it was Pfizer, Moderna, those are two dose,

291
0:30:51,760 --> 0:30:58,880
we might look at switching over to a different vaccine, and it is. It's the mRNA vaccines that

292
0:30:58,880 --> 0:31:03,760
really have this connection. We're saying it's about one in 100, one in 200,000

293
0:31:03,760 --> 0:31:08,880
risk of a myocarditis. I don't know if that's what's causing the arrhythmia. I'm not even sure

294
0:31:08,880 --> 0:31:14,720
it's causal, certainly here. But a lot of this is going to depend where you are in the world.

295
0:31:14,720 --> 0:31:20,560
If you had an issue with that first AstraZeneca vaccine, do you have the ability to switch to

296
0:31:20,560 --> 0:31:26,800
a different vaccine to complete this? Can you go ahead and then do a Pfizer 2 dose, which would

297
0:31:26,800 --> 0:31:32,160
be actually how we would approach that. We would just give, at this point, heterogenous or mix and

298
0:31:32,160 --> 0:31:38,400
match. That's going to sort of depend where you are. If you do not have a choice, then this is

299
0:31:38,400 --> 0:31:44,720
going to become that risk benefit of, are you going to risk getting COVID, or are you going to risk

300
0:31:44,720 --> 0:31:50,720
potentially having arrhythmia cardiac issues after that? That's a tough call, and I see why

301
0:31:50,720 --> 0:31:55,280
they're saying you should go see a physician, you should see a cardiologist. They can get to the

302
0:31:55,280 --> 0:31:59,920
root of this. Hopefully, they can even get a sense of whether or not it makes logical sense

303
0:31:59,920 --> 0:32:04,320
them. This is related. I mean, the five days after, there's that sort of causal suggestion.

304
0:32:05,040 --> 0:32:10,000
And I have to say, this could be the last sort of is the Delta variant. What is the only good thing

305
0:32:10,000 --> 0:32:14,480
about the Delta variant is we actually are seeing an uptick in people coming and saying, you know,

306
0:32:14,480 --> 0:32:18,240
I wasn't going to get vaccinated. But now with everything I'm reading about the Delta variant

307
0:32:18,240 --> 0:32:23,440
in the media echo chamber, I'm not a huge fan of the end justifies the means. I think we need to

308
0:32:23,440 --> 0:32:27,680
be honest. But I'm always happy to hear people coming in and getting vaccinated.

309
0:32:27,680 --> 0:32:32,240
My, my view, Daniel, is that at least people stopped using the word strain. They're using

310
0:32:32,240 --> 0:32:39,440
variant that. Okay, we'll take what we can, Vince. All right, Ken writes, I've just watched a

311
0:32:39,440 --> 0:32:43,920
presentation where several medical doctors have hypothesized based on clinical studies

312
0:32:44,480 --> 0:32:49,440
that long haul COVID is caused by the presence of nonclassical monocytes containing S1 protein

313
0:32:49,440 --> 0:32:54,880
fragments located on a Neil epithelial cells of blood vessels. These cells apparently engender

314
0:32:54,880 --> 0:32:59,840
various inflammatory conditions in the vascular system, presenting as common symptoms of long

315
0:32:59,840 --> 0:33:04,880
COVID. The doctors have also presented evidence from their own practice that the use of statins

316
0:33:04,880 --> 0:33:10,160
and Ivermectin have benefited patients by presumably shutting down over active monocytes or somehow

317
0:33:10,160 --> 0:33:15,040
blocking the effect of residual S1. I'm not a doctor or scientist, but I would love to hear

318
0:33:15,040 --> 0:33:20,720
your thoughts on this hypothesis. Yeah, so I'm going to comment. I hope those physicians didn't

319
0:33:20,720 --> 0:33:25,200
use the word evidence when they were describing their anecdotes, their clinical anecdotes.

320
0:33:26,240 --> 0:33:30,800
You know, the way science is supposed to work, and I really am a little troubled by what happened

321
0:33:30,800 --> 0:33:36,720
during the COVID-19 pandemic is you may make some observations in the clinic. And that's really

322
0:33:36,720 --> 0:33:42,400
what drives you to say we need to study this. We need to find out if it's true. It is very easy

323
0:33:42,400 --> 0:33:51,040
to be tricked by our observations, by our selective memory of things. And so normally you would have

324
0:33:51,040 --> 0:33:57,120
a theory. You might do some basic science to get a sense of whether or not that's true. If that

325
0:33:57,120 --> 0:34:02,480
seems consistent, then you would look at a small trial to get a sense. Then you would talk to your

326
0:34:02,480 --> 0:34:06,400
statisticians about how many people do we need to have in this trial? Because you don't willy

327
0:34:06,400 --> 0:34:12,960
nilly start giving medicines to lots of people. Unfortunately, the last 18 months has been sort

328
0:34:12,960 --> 0:34:19,360
of the Wild West. I'm hoping we're getting away from influencers, thought leaders, spreading

329
0:34:19,360 --> 0:34:24,080
Atlantic Dodes. I think we got to get back to science. And what is science? Science is really

330
0:34:24,080 --> 0:34:29,920
just asking in a way that you can find out the truth. What works? What does it work? And then

331
0:34:29,920 --> 0:34:33,920
the risk benefit of making different choices and different recommendations for our patients.

332
0:34:33,920 --> 0:34:39,920
What is it that Mark Chris lip says, the three most dangerous word that a doctor says?

333
0:34:41,120 --> 0:34:48,320
In my experience. There you go. And I like to say the plural of anecdote is not data.

334
0:34:49,440 --> 0:34:55,360
That's a good one. That's a good one too. Ken, by the way, said he had long whole COVID in November

335
0:34:55,360 --> 0:35:01,920
and then it got better after his first dose of Moderna. That's fantastic. No, I mean, we are

336
0:35:01,920 --> 0:35:07,520
seeing that. I know Akiko up at Yale is working on studying this but having issues recruiting enough

337
0:35:07,520 --> 0:35:14,400
patients. So we are seeing this. It's nice that we had this UK investigation. Just more support,

338
0:35:14,400 --> 0:35:18,080
right? And again, this is an issue. We have observations in the clinic. We have to do these

339
0:35:18,080 --> 0:35:23,360
informal ways to really turn those anecdotes into information. All right, one more from Danielle.

340
0:35:23,360 --> 0:35:33,120
I think we covered this but Danielle got her first J&J in April and then decided to get a dose of

341
0:35:33,120 --> 0:35:40,960
Pfizer and listened to your podcast last week about a person who got two more doses of a vaccine

342
0:35:40,960 --> 0:35:45,280
even after Sputnik. And she wants to know is whether it's safe to go ahead, get the second

343
0:35:45,280 --> 0:35:49,840
Pfizer dose or whether I would be subjecting my immune system to too much immune stimulation.

344
0:35:49,840 --> 0:35:54,480
Yeah, I think there's two topics here to touch on. We'll start with the safety issue, right?

345
0:35:55,200 --> 0:36:00,240
You know, the US as far as recognizing someone is fully vaccinated, there's the list of not only

346
0:36:00,240 --> 0:36:08,080
EUA, so US FDA, EUA approved, but also now WHO approved vaccines and you look at that list.

347
0:36:08,080 --> 0:36:12,240
And if you completed the series, you can be considered, recognized, all the rights and

348
0:36:12,240 --> 0:36:17,280
privileges of being fully vaccinated. But we're certainly, we certainly have seen a lot of

349
0:36:17,280 --> 0:36:23,760
individuals that didn't meet that criteria and ended up getting a couple more doses of a US FDA

350
0:36:23,760 --> 0:36:29,200
EUA approved vaccine, even though they already had received some other unrecognized unapproved

351
0:36:29,200 --> 0:36:35,040
vaccine outside the country. So from a safety point of view, not been formally studied,

352
0:36:35,040 --> 0:36:39,120
we do now have experience with thousands of individuals who have gone through this. We're

353
0:36:39,120 --> 0:36:43,600
not seeing any reports in VAERS or anything else. So from a safety standpoint, I'm not concerned,

354
0:36:43,600 --> 0:36:48,800
but I am concerned about the logic here, right? The JJ is a very effective vaccine for doing what

355
0:36:48,800 --> 0:36:54,880
we want it to do. I'm not sure you really need to be topping things off with an mRNA series.

356
0:36:54,880 --> 0:37:00,560
That's COVID-19 clinical update number 70 with Dr. Daniel Griffin. Thank you, Daniel.

357
0:37:00,560 --> 0:37:14,400
Oh, thank you, Vincent. Thank you, everybody, and be safe.
