This week in virology, the podcast about viruses, the kind that make you sick.

2
0:00:10,160 --> 0:00:20,000
From Microbe TV, this is Twiv, this week in virology, episode 698, recorded on December 24,

3
0:00:20,000 --> 0:00:26,720
2020. I'm Vincent Rackeniello, and you're listening to the podcast All About Viruses.

4
0:00:26,720 --> 0:00:33,200
Joining me today from New York, Daniel Griffin. Hello, everyone.

5
0:00:34,160 --> 0:00:42,880
I should say the vaccinated Daniel Griffin, right? Yes, yes. I feel very excited and privileged

6
0:00:43,520 --> 0:00:48,560
for two reasons. One is to get the vaccine, but also the fact that I have had zero side effects.

7
0:00:50,000 --> 0:00:52,960
But I want to take that with a bit of humility, because some people, as we know,

8
0:00:52,960 --> 0:00:58,400
some people have had fevers, headaches, soreness, the reactogenicity we talked about.

9
0:00:59,040 --> 0:01:03,760
I count myself lucky on multiple fronts. When did you get it yesterday?

10
0:01:04,560 --> 0:01:11,760
Yesterday morning, 915. No soreness, no malaise, no fatigue, no pain at the injection site,

11
0:01:11,760 --> 0:01:16,800
none of that stuff. Vincent, I went to the pharmacist who gave it to me and I asked,

12
0:01:16,800 --> 0:01:22,480
was I in the placebo arm? What happened? How come I don't feel anything? No, just a joke.

13
0:01:23,360 --> 0:01:28,000
Well, you sent me a video. And if you don't mind, we'll insert it in right now so people can see

14
0:01:28,000 --> 0:01:32,080
it. Does that work? Okay, that's great. People can watch. You're wearing your COVID socks. Yes,

15
0:01:32,080 --> 0:01:48,000
got my COVID socks. Those are my COVID socks with COVID toes.

16
0:01:48,000 --> 0:02:02,800
How was that? I didn't even feel a thing. Oh, that's good.

17
0:02:05,440 --> 0:02:10,960
All right, so we're going to have you monitored for about 15 minutes. I'm going to write the

18
0:02:10,960 --> 0:02:15,440
time down. They're going to monitor you on the other side. And so Daniel, you have to go back

19
0:02:15,440 --> 0:02:21,360
in two weeks for a booster, right? So actually, I did the Moderna shot. So it will be four weeks,

20
0:02:21,360 --> 0:02:26,400
four weeks before I returned. Excellent. Congratulations. Well deserved.

21
0:02:26,400 --> 0:02:31,040
And people people asked, right? You know, my, you know, what's going on here? You know, Biden and

22
0:02:31,040 --> 0:02:36,800
Pence got Pfizer, you and Fauci got Moderna. It was what they offered me just. Yeah, it's what

23
0:02:36,800 --> 0:02:45,280
you can get. Whatever they offer. Someone said, someone said last night, you know, the way I look

24
0:02:45,280 --> 0:02:51,120
at it, whatever beer is put in front of me, I drink that one. That was one of your Irish friends,

25
0:02:51,120 --> 0:02:57,680
I take it. Probably, yes. All right. Well, we have a lot to go through today. And I know around

26
0:02:57,680 --> 0:03:03,680
the holidays, people are going to be busy. So I don't want to want to take too much time. So let's

27
0:03:03,680 --> 0:03:10,720
go right for it. All right. Start with my quotation. If you judge people, you have no time to love

28
0:03:10,720 --> 0:03:16,480
them. And that's a mother Teresa quote, which I think is hopefully appropriate for this time of

29
0:03:16,480 --> 0:03:21,840
year. Now, over the last year, I've quoted Winston Churchill many times, and I'll do that again.

30
0:03:22,400 --> 0:03:28,640
I've also quoted Ursula K. Le Guin, Taylor Swift, Ruth Bader Ginsburg. And now this is actually

31
0:03:28,640 --> 0:03:34,160
the second time for mother Teresa. I always try to pick a quotation that sets the tone for what I'm

32
0:03:34,160 --> 0:03:41,920
going to be speaking about. And actually, many years ago, and it is many, when I was working in

33
0:03:41,920 --> 0:03:48,320
Kathmandu, Nepal is actually invited to work with Mother Teresa. And in my usual, I was much too busy

34
0:03:48,320 --> 0:03:54,640
doing other things and missed that opportunity. And she's a complicated woman like many of us. So

35
0:03:54,640 --> 0:04:00,000
I just thought that that was an appropriate quote for this time of year. So let's go through,

36
0:04:00,000 --> 0:04:06,240
and also for what I'm about to say, as far as patient updates, I think people are probably aware

37
0:04:06,240 --> 0:04:12,320
that things are not going well in the United States right now. We've had many days now with

38
0:04:12,320 --> 0:04:18,560
over 3000 deaths per day. Some of our hospitals have gotten so busy that you've probably heard

39
0:04:18,560 --> 0:04:25,280
word that there's actually triage of medical care, where there's concerns with that enough

40
0:04:25,280 --> 0:04:33,600
hospital bed, not enough ICU's patients in the hospital are being encouraged. If they don't look

41
0:04:33,600 --> 0:04:39,280
like they have a good chance to be put under hospice care, put on morphine, drips, comfort care,

42
0:04:39,280 --> 0:04:43,920
it's this is not good. This is not what we want to see around the holidays. So it is heartbreaking.

43
0:04:43,920 --> 0:04:50,800
But there's lots of travel going on right now in the US. And lots of people are actually getting

44
0:04:50,800 --> 0:04:57,440
together for the holidays. And what I like to point out is that shaming does not actually help.

45
0:04:57,440 --> 0:05:03,840
Shaming actually increases bad behavior. So people have made plans. People get together. So I think

46
0:05:03,840 --> 0:05:09,440
our role as physicians is to be helpful. What can we do to help people? And one of the things

47
0:05:09,440 --> 0:05:15,840
that I keep reinforcing is frequent testing. If someone gets tested, that's not a free pass.

48
0:05:15,840 --> 0:05:21,680
But if that test is positive, that person is hopefully not going to go to the Christmas dinner

49
0:05:22,480 --> 0:05:27,280
or the New Year's party. Some people go to that New Year's party anyway. So that's something

50
0:05:27,280 --> 0:05:32,960
to keep in mind. If people do get sick, we're going to talk about some of these therapies

51
0:05:32,960 --> 0:05:38,080
as we go forward. But this is a time to have conversations. Talk about what you've learned

52
0:05:38,080 --> 0:05:42,800
if people have had vaccines. A great time to share your experiences over the holidays. If you're

53
0:05:42,800 --> 0:05:48,720
going to be communicating or seeing in person ones you love. Talk about monoclonal antibodies,

54
0:05:48,720 --> 0:05:54,880
other things. I think it's important to have dialogues. We've got to stop, I think, breaking

55
0:05:54,880 --> 0:06:01,600
up into camps. So schools, not much here. We're actually on Christmas break here in the US.

56
0:06:02,240 --> 0:06:06,880
And if we can only speed things up, we can get those teachers vaccinated very soon.

57
0:06:06,880 --> 0:06:13,840
We'll talk a little bit about the change in the hierarchy, the phases. Everyone is now

58
0:06:13,840 --> 0:06:22,160
in phase one, A, B, or C. So we'll talk about that. And the UK variant, just in time for the holidays.

59
0:06:22,880 --> 0:06:28,480
And this has been covered quite well. But I thought a story right here would be a Christmas

60
0:06:28,480 --> 0:06:36,800
story would be appropriate, a holiday story. I was on a FaceTime call with a, I'm going to say

61
0:06:36,800 --> 0:06:43,600
a friend of mine. It's actually the parents of one of my friends. But I think that I'd become

62
0:06:43,600 --> 0:06:49,040
friendly with the parents. And we actually have sort of had a connection through the pandemic

63
0:06:49,040 --> 0:06:56,480
because it was actually in January when it was my friend Gareth's father. Actually, yes, you know,

64
0:06:56,480 --> 0:07:01,600
what does Dan think about this whole virus thing? And we looked back at the text at the time and

65
0:07:01,600 --> 0:07:07,200
it was, yeah, I think this guy actually may be falling. I think this is going to be a significant

66
0:07:07,200 --> 0:07:11,920
issue. So I was talking to him a little bit about what's going on in there in the UK. I see these

67
0:07:11,920 --> 0:07:17,040
numbers rising. He's like, I don't understand. We're being so careful. You know, when I go to

68
0:07:17,040 --> 0:07:22,720
the pubs every night, all the windows are open. You know, when I'm when I'm riding on the bus,

69
0:07:22,720 --> 0:07:28,320
all the windows are open. When I'm on the train, everyone wears a mask except when they're eating

70
0:07:28,320 --> 0:07:31,600
or drinking, I always try to have something to eat or drink because I don't like wearing the mask.

71
0:07:32,400 --> 0:07:38,160
And the wife and I, we were planning on going out to Christmas Eve dinner together. But the tables

72
0:07:38,160 --> 0:07:41,200
in the crowded restaurant, they were all going to be spaced apart and the windows were going to

73
0:07:41,200 --> 0:07:45,840
be up, but we're going to wear our jackets. We were going to be very safe. And I said, well,

74
0:07:45,840 --> 0:07:51,120
what did you do today? Well, apparently, bars has decided to shut down the country again tonight

75
0:07:51,120 --> 0:07:55,600
at midnight. So we all ran out to the supermarkets to get all our shopping done. And it was so nice.

76
0:07:55,600 --> 0:08:03,280
We got to see everyone. Everyone was out shopping. And so I, I don't think you need a UK variant

77
0:08:03,280 --> 0:08:08,320
to explain what's going on as far as spread in the UK at the moment. Thank you, Daniel,

78
0:08:08,320 --> 0:08:14,800
because I have to say, first we had the D614G variant more transmissible. Now we have the UK

79
0:08:14,800 --> 0:08:20,880
variant supposedly more transmissible and another UK variant supposedly more transmissible. This

80
0:08:20,880 --> 0:08:27,200
ain't the way viruses work. Something's amiss. And I hope they sort it out. I just.

81
0:08:27,200 --> 0:08:31,600
But Vincent, as you heard, they're being so careful when they crowd in the pubs for their

82
0:08:31,600 --> 0:08:35,600
beers, the windows are open. How could the virus spread in such a setting?

83
0:08:36,960 --> 0:08:37,920
Thank you, Daniel.

84
0:08:37,920 --> 0:08:42,320
Now, last time I promised I would touch on vitamin D and hypermectin. And I think it's

85
0:08:42,320 --> 0:08:46,400
important that I comment on this because I don't want to leave a vacuum. Why isn't Dr. Griffin

86
0:08:46,400 --> 0:08:51,920
talking about these two things? So vitamin D is going to be very straightforward. The last time

87
0:08:51,920 --> 0:08:57,600
I spoke about this was October 4th. And we had reached a million deaths in the world from COVID

88
0:08:57,600 --> 0:09:02,160
at that point. I think I'm echoing what, when I think about you said very simply, there's no

89
0:09:02,160 --> 0:09:08,240
good reason to be vitamin D deficient, right? And we know that particularly in northern

90
0:09:08,240 --> 0:09:15,200
climbs in the winter, the incidence of vitamin D deficiency goes up. There does appear to be

91
0:09:15,200 --> 0:09:20,800
a consistent correlation between people who are low in vitamin D and getting infected. There also

92
0:09:20,800 --> 0:09:26,000
seems to be now several studies suggesting that people with low vitamin D have worse outcomes.

93
0:09:26,960 --> 0:09:31,280
We haven't shown benefit of giving vitamin D once you've ended up in the hospital. So

94
0:09:31,280 --> 0:09:34,880
this looks like something you want to you want to be doing ahead of time if it's going to be a

95
0:09:34,880 --> 0:09:40,480
benefit. So since this is going to drop after Christmas, I there's a rumor that Santa Claus is

96
0:09:40,480 --> 0:09:46,240
putting vitamin D in my children's stockings. So take your vitamin D. There's there's no reason

97
0:09:46,240 --> 0:09:52,320
to be deficient in vitamin D. There's no evidence of harm. And you know, maybe there's a benefit

98
0:09:52,320 --> 0:09:57,280
here, right? We're seeing a number of studies. Now, what about Ivermectin? And I'm going to say,

99
0:09:57,280 --> 0:10:02,640
this is this is a little bit more complicated. And I get this question quite often because as

100
0:10:02,640 --> 0:10:09,200
people who listen to this weekend, parasitism are aware that I'm actually a parasitologist

101
0:10:09,200 --> 0:10:14,000
and prior to the pandemic, I was actually probably one of the few physicians in the US that was

102
0:10:14,000 --> 0:10:20,400
using Ivermectin on a regular basis. So extensive experience with this medicine prior to COVID-19.

103
0:10:21,280 --> 0:10:27,440
So what is Ivermectin? And this is, I got to say, a fun story. I mean, in the late 1960s,

104
0:10:27,440 --> 0:10:32,640
there was a Japanese microbiologist gathering soil samples, growing things up,

105
0:10:32,640 --> 0:10:39,040
testing them for any, you know, active compounds being produced. And near a golf course in southwest

106
0:10:39,040 --> 0:10:46,640
Tokyo, he collected some dirt and actually was able to grow a bacterial species, streptomyces

107
0:10:47,200 --> 0:10:54,320
Avermectilis. And this bacterial species actually produced an active component,

108
0:10:54,320 --> 0:11:01,600
Avermectin. This was chemically modified to Ivermectin. And there was a collaboration here

109
0:11:01,600 --> 0:11:09,840
between Satoshi Omora in Japan and William Campbell, who actually has been on, he's been on

110
0:11:09,840 --> 0:11:17,680
TWIP actually, or TWIP, he's been on TWIP. So he actually received the Nobel Prize for Ivermectin.

111
0:11:17,680 --> 0:11:23,360
And what is Ivermectin? So it's actually a compound that binds to the glutamate-gated

112
0:11:23,360 --> 0:11:29,200
chloride ion channels, which are found in inverbate nerve muscle cells. This leads to

113
0:11:29,200 --> 0:11:35,440
increased permeability of the membranes, hyperpolarization, and eventually death of

114
0:11:35,440 --> 0:11:41,360
the parasites that we classically use this in. So what's going on with an anti-parasitic agent

115
0:11:41,360 --> 0:11:48,800
and COVID-19? December 8th, Pierre Corey, he's a pulmonologist, critical care specialist,

116
0:11:49,440 --> 0:11:55,360
testified before Congress about Ivermectin. And he went through a lot of studies that have

117
0:11:55,360 --> 0:12:00,400
been done to date. And he's actually part of an organization, the Frontline COVID-19 Critical Care

118
0:12:00,400 --> 0:12:08,160
Alliance, which was started by Paul Merrick, another critical care specialist. And I have to say,

119
0:12:08,160 --> 0:12:12,720
I know these physicians actually have emailed, I've co-authored a couple papers with them,

120
0:12:12,720 --> 0:12:16,240
they're bright academic clinicians, they're who care passionately about their patients,

121
0:12:16,240 --> 0:12:22,560
they're not quacks, they're not lunatic fringe. These are people who are in the trenches,

122
0:12:22,560 --> 0:12:29,040
seeing people die in front of them and desperate for a solution. So how did Ivermectin and COVID

123
0:12:29,040 --> 0:12:36,400
get started? It goes back to actually a paper we discussed on Twiv, early on, right, April,

124
0:12:36,400 --> 0:12:41,600
the FDA approved drug Ivermectin inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.

125
0:12:42,320 --> 0:12:48,800
And I'll be honest, I felt like that was a dishonest title. It is FDA approved, but not for

126
0:12:48,800 --> 0:12:54,720
COVID-19, not for inhibiting replication of SARS-CoV-2. So immediately I was flooded with,

127
0:12:54,720 --> 0:13:01,120
wow, there's an FDA approved drug for SARS-CoV-2. I was like, well, yeah, not really. And there were

128
0:13:01,120 --> 0:13:05,920
also some concerns about concentrations being used. Could this be actually realized in a human

129
0:13:05,920 --> 0:13:12,160
host or something about 10,000 times the amount of what we normally would do? So I did not like

130
0:13:12,160 --> 0:13:17,600
this article. Actually, I felt like it was misleading in the title. But it did start to raise a bunch

131
0:13:17,600 --> 0:13:23,920
of questions. It got people interested in Ivermectin. And it sort of raised the issue, well, what do we

132
0:13:23,920 --> 0:13:28,240
think Ivermectin is going to do if they're going to be using it? And I would say you can't eat the

133
0:13:28,240 --> 0:13:36,080
entire cake and still have it. Is the thought that Ivermectin is an antiviral? Is it anti-inflammatory?

134
0:13:36,640 --> 0:13:40,560
Is it boosting the immune system, right? Because we want one or the other timing would matter.

135
0:13:41,360 --> 0:13:46,400
Does it do something entirely different? Are we using this in, I'll say, areas of the world with

136
0:13:46,400 --> 0:13:52,000
heavy parasite burden? And we're actually treating parasites and maybe that might be born out.

137
0:13:52,000 --> 0:13:57,840
So back in July, some of my other friends, and these, I'll say even closer friends, hung out with

138
0:13:57,840 --> 0:14:06,000
these folks, published a paper, COVID-19 and dexamethasone, a potential strategy to avoid steroid-related

139
0:14:06,000 --> 0:14:12,640
strong alloyties hyper infection. This was published in JAMA. First author was William Stauffer.

140
0:14:12,640 --> 0:14:18,960
I actually met him in Thailand up near the Burmese border. I was staying at the Queens and Malaria

141
0:14:18,960 --> 0:14:23,920
station. So he and I hung out there for a few days and swam in the river there. You had to go

142
0:14:23,920 --> 0:14:29,280
make sure you knew where the king cobra was before you went in. And also, Pat Walker was there. She

143
0:14:29,280 --> 0:14:34,320
was the prior president of ASTMH. And we spent about three weeks together. This is back in the

144
0:14:34,320 --> 0:14:40,000
summer of 2016 in Thailand at Cambodia, went to Angarwa. I think she was there when I ran the

145
0:14:40,000 --> 0:14:46,640
marathon with the princess. And what they actually were raising this concern, and I think our

146
0:14:46,640 --> 0:14:53,120
Twip listeners will think about this and it will ring some bells. What if this dexamethasone,

147
0:14:53,120 --> 0:15:00,080
what if the steroids that are now being encouraged to be used in COVID-19 are being used widely

148
0:15:00,080 --> 0:15:05,360
throughout areas of the world that have parasitic issues, particularly stronger loyties? And our

149
0:15:05,360 --> 0:15:11,120
Twip listeners, what is stronger loyties? You have to listen to Twip now. Many parts of the world,

150
0:15:11,120 --> 0:15:16,960
we say 10 to 40% of populations can actually have a chronic infection with this parasite.

151
0:15:16,960 --> 0:15:24,560
Some areas of the world, I'm going to say Egypt, Bangladesh, parts of Peru, particularly parts

152
0:15:24,560 --> 0:15:32,560
of Peru with an HDLV, a viral co-infection. They can have rates as high as 70%. So when you start

153
0:15:32,560 --> 0:15:39,040
giving these people a 10 or a 15, because I've seen longer courses of steroids, you actually,

154
0:15:39,040 --> 0:15:45,200
we've presented some cases, you are at risk of triggering a strongly hyperinfection. These

155
0:15:45,200 --> 0:15:50,160
parasites can actually come through the bowel wall. They can lead to a gram-negative sepsis and

156
0:15:50,160 --> 0:15:55,280
death in many standpoints. So they actually, at that point, were raising the issue, not thinking

157
0:15:55,280 --> 0:16:00,560
of an antiviral effect, but thinking about a lot of parts of the world, you may have a mortality

158
0:16:00,560 --> 0:16:06,880
issue from this and the use of steroids that supersedes any benefit you think you're going to get

159
0:16:06,880 --> 0:16:13,840
from steroids. So when I started hearing and seeing all these ivermectin publications,

160
0:16:14,480 --> 0:16:20,560
it started actually making me look into this issue. Where are these studies? Peru, Egypt,

161
0:16:20,560 --> 0:16:26,240
Bangladesh, India. And as some of our listeners may know, particularly with a colleague of mine,

162
0:16:26,240 --> 0:16:32,000
Dr. Karapati, we've been managing and trying to help assist management of patients remotely in

163
0:16:32,000 --> 0:16:37,120
parts of the world like this in India, particularly. And it is kind of amazing what goes on.

164
0:16:38,080 --> 0:16:42,480
Once they heard about steroids, a patient will get 10 days of steroids. They'll get ivermectin

165
0:16:42,480 --> 0:16:47,120
at one hospital. They won't be doing well. They'll transfer to another hospital. They'll get another

166
0:16:47,120 --> 0:16:54,400
10 days of steroids. They'll get another five days of remdesivir. So it's actually kind of

167
0:16:54,400 --> 0:17:01,040
an interesting, complicated issue. And I know these clinicians are seeing these studies come

168
0:17:01,040 --> 0:17:06,640
out of parts of the world. And there are some small randomized control trials and they're

169
0:17:06,640 --> 0:17:11,600
a little difficult to sort out. There's a cyclin still in there. There's azithromycin,

170
0:17:11,600 --> 0:17:17,440
hydroxychloroquine is still being used in these areas. So I think there's potentially an

171
0:17:17,440 --> 0:17:24,640
interesting story here. My understanding is there's a few studies that will be coming out in in

172
0:17:24,640 --> 0:17:30,480
January. So I look forward to getting more information. I don't quite understand what's going on here

173
0:17:30,480 --> 0:17:36,560
right now to be completely honest, which is tough, right? Because having, you know, having said that,

174
0:17:36,560 --> 0:17:42,880
I mentioned in the US 3000 people are dying a day. If I had an individual from an area of the world

175
0:17:42,880 --> 0:17:47,600
where there was a high incidence of strong alloys and I was starting steroids, I probably would want

176
0:17:47,600 --> 0:17:53,120
to check a strong alloys serology. I probably would want to check the stool for larva. I think

177
0:17:53,120 --> 0:17:59,360
it's worth sort of trying to understand what's going on here. But don't run out and grab your

178
0:17:59,360 --> 0:18:04,960
veterinary Ivermectin. Don't start taking the medicine that your dog or your cat are supposed

179
0:18:04,960 --> 0:18:10,960
to be taking. But I think there's a back room here right now. There's clinicians at the bedside.

180
0:18:10,960 --> 0:18:13,920
They have patients dying in front of them. They're trying to figure out what to do.

181
0:18:14,880 --> 0:18:20,080
And I think it's important that I at least raise this. And as we get more information,

182
0:18:20,080 --> 0:18:27,040
I'll return to it. But just to say, Ivermectin is a very broad spectrum anti-parasitic. We use it

183
0:18:27,040 --> 0:18:33,520
for algo-circiasis. People may know about the river blindness mass drug campaign. We use it for

184
0:18:33,520 --> 0:18:44,320
strong alloys, eschariasis. We use it for nathostomyces, hookworm, lice, matinelli, scabies. That's

185
0:18:44,320 --> 0:18:49,600
off-label, by the way. Ucheria bancrofti. There's actually some studies showing it can have an

186
0:18:49,600 --> 0:18:54,960
effect on malaria. So there's a lot going on here. And I'll be very curious to see what sort of

187
0:18:54,960 --> 0:19:00,160
pads out. But just to say, these are not fringe physicians. These are passionate bright people

188
0:19:00,160 --> 0:19:04,800
trying to figure out how to save lives. And I think we need to work together and figure out

189
0:19:04,800 --> 0:19:10,640
what to do. Can I ask you just quickly? Yeah, go ahead. Is it likely that we're going to have a

190
0:19:11,840 --> 0:19:17,280
double blind, randomly controlled clinical trial for Ivermectin and COVID-19? Or is it going to

191
0:19:17,280 --> 0:19:22,560
just be compassionate use right off the bat? You know, so it is FDA approved, which means that,

192
0:19:22,560 --> 0:19:27,280
you know, if you make a judgment call and want to give this to a patient in the context, you can.

193
0:19:27,280 --> 0:19:33,200
There are randomized controlled trials that are going on right now. And actually, there's several

194
0:19:33,200 --> 0:19:38,160
of them that are going on here in the US. So we will have data. And I know that sometimes,

195
0:19:38,160 --> 0:19:44,560
and we've kind of gone through the different approaches to medicine, I really am swayed by a

196
0:19:44,560 --> 0:19:50,400
well-done randomized controlled, blinded study. I don't think you could just know what works.

197
0:19:50,400 --> 0:19:54,640
I think you actually have to do the science. And we're going to be getting this. Vaccines,

198
0:19:54,640 --> 0:20:01,760
right? So active vaccines. I saw a very curious, I think it was an anti-vax post. I'm not sure,

199
0:20:01,760 --> 0:20:06,800
actually. And it was where a person was saying, you know, you people with your vaccines, instead

200
0:20:06,800 --> 0:20:13,520
of a vaccine, couldn't we just expose people to a weakened version of a virus and then let them

201
0:20:13,520 --> 0:20:18,080
develop an immune response to it? And you know, I was thinking minutes and I'm like,

202
0:20:18,080 --> 0:20:24,880
don't we call that an attenuated vaccine? Maybe we're just mixing words here. We do.

203
0:20:24,880 --> 0:20:30,400
So I thought it was interesting. But, you know, big news since we last talked, I think everyone

204
0:20:30,400 --> 0:20:37,520
is aware, E-way from Moderna. I actually got my Moderna here. But what about prioritization?

205
0:20:37,520 --> 0:20:42,560
This keeps changing. Who gets the vaccine when? I mean, the first thing that's been in the newspapers,

206
0:20:42,560 --> 0:20:49,200
and I think this is upsetting to all of us, is how slow the rollout is going. 10 million doses of

207
0:20:49,200 --> 0:20:54,560
vaccines have been distributed. Only a million have ended up in arms. That's going to take us at

208
0:20:54,560 --> 0:21:01,360
this rate, like 6.6 million years, now 6.6 years to vaccinate the entire US population.

209
0:21:01,360 --> 0:21:06,880
The UK, they're doing about 140 k a week. So they're basically going to finish vaccinating their

210
0:21:06,880 --> 0:21:12,400
country a little bit after the time that they have to start again. So we really got to pick up

211
0:21:12,400 --> 0:21:18,720
the pace. One of the challenges is right now, we're in phase one A, where we're trying to do

212
0:21:18,720 --> 0:21:23,360
healthcare personnel. And a lot of the healthcare personnel that I've started with are what are

213
0:21:23,360 --> 0:21:29,120
considered higher priorities. So ICU, ER, and they're working in visiting hospitals. The vaccines

214
0:21:29,120 --> 0:21:34,320
have been sent to those busy hospitals. So it's really challenged for these facilities to try to

215
0:21:34,320 --> 0:21:38,560
vaccinate all their workers. And at the same time, take care of more COVID patients that they've

216
0:21:38,560 --> 0:21:44,800
ever had before, triaging staff and personnel and resources. So I'm hoping we learned from this.

217
0:21:44,800 --> 0:21:48,800
Maybe that's not, you know, no chiefs keep throwing stuff on the top of the hospitals during a

218
0:21:48,800 --> 0:21:55,200
pandemic. Let's see if there's other organizations that can jump in and help. But the prioritization

219
0:21:55,200 --> 0:22:01,840
changed as of December 20. So let's get everyone up to speed. Phase one A, right? That's we're

220
0:22:01,840 --> 0:22:08,560
familiar with. That's long term care facility residents and staff that fired up this week. And

221
0:22:08,560 --> 0:22:15,760
that that looks to be going well, a captive audience, right? So that that is going to be, I think,

222
0:22:15,760 --> 0:22:21,840
for us in the acute care settings, a game changer. That was what flooded us in the first wave in

223
0:22:21,840 --> 0:22:26,400
New York back in April. Half of the deaths were in individuals from the long term care facility.

224
0:22:26,400 --> 0:22:30,960
So if these individuals could be protected and the people that take care of them protected,

225
0:22:30,960 --> 0:22:36,080
that's huge. The healthcare personnel, I think that's really important from a raw standpoint.

226
0:22:37,280 --> 0:22:42,400
I think a lot of us have learned how to take care of ourselves. So in the UK, they're not doing it

227
0:22:42,400 --> 0:22:46,960
the same way in the UK. They're focused on the older individuals. But we've got the older

228
0:22:46,960 --> 0:22:54,320
individuals here in the US right behind this phase one B, which is now individuals who are 75 and

229
0:22:54,320 --> 0:23:01,200
older, as well as frontline essential workers. And I'm going to go through what is a frontline

230
0:23:01,200 --> 0:23:10,720
essential worker? Then we have phase one C, and that's everyone age 65 to 74, or anyone under 65,

231
0:23:10,720 --> 0:23:16,480
but with a high risk medical problem, and all the other essential workers. What are frontline

232
0:23:16,480 --> 0:23:20,000
essential workers? And I'm hoping as I go through this list, people are going to say,

233
0:23:20,000 --> 0:23:24,720
I want to sign up and be one of those for, well, because now they realize that this is a frontline

234
0:23:24,720 --> 0:23:30,240
essential worker, or two, they think if I'm doing this job, I get vaccinated early. So either way,

235
0:23:30,240 --> 0:23:35,600
first responders, those are the firefighters, the police. What about the EMTs? The EMTs are

236
0:23:35,600 --> 0:23:40,800
actually supposed to be in 1A, so they should be being done sooner. Education, right? These are

237
0:23:40,800 --> 0:23:47,040
the teachers, the support staff for our schools, the daycare people. That's right at the top of

238
0:23:47,040 --> 0:23:52,080
our frontline essential workers. But we also move into people working in food and agriculture,

239
0:23:52,080 --> 0:23:58,080
you got to eat, you move into manufacturing, people working in corrections, the postal service,

240
0:23:58,880 --> 0:24:06,240
people who are transit workers, public transit workers, grocery store workers. So that's about

241
0:24:06,240 --> 0:24:12,240
30 million people in the considered frontline essential workers. And then in one C, you move

242
0:24:12,240 --> 0:24:18,720
into the other essential workers, as well as those younger 65 to 74. And that's going to be

243
0:24:18,720 --> 0:24:25,040
more transportation, logistics, more food service, construction, finance, IT and communication.

244
0:24:25,040 --> 0:24:30,000
Okay. Actually, we talked about that. I think about our medical practices. If the IT goes down,

245
0:24:30,560 --> 0:24:36,480
that's a problem. People working in energy, legal, public safety, wastewater.

246
0:24:36,480 --> 0:24:42,640
So, and then what are those high-risk medical conditions? It's cancer, kidney disease,

247
0:24:43,360 --> 0:24:47,200
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart conditions, immunocompromise,

248
0:24:48,000 --> 0:24:55,120
obesity above a certain level. Pregnancy, interesting, is a prioritization in one C,

249
0:24:55,120 --> 0:25:00,800
sickle cell disease, diabetes. Couple challenges that we have in front of us, right? We're not

250
0:25:00,800 --> 0:25:05,840
meeting the first challenge of getting the first shot in, but these are two dose vaccines that we

251
0:25:05,840 --> 0:25:10,720
have in front of us. And the literature that we have from other vaccines is the majority. People

252
0:25:10,720 --> 0:25:16,320
don't get that second dose. This is critical. We keep reinforcing this. If you only get one dose,

253
0:25:16,320 --> 0:25:22,880
you may only have about 50% protection. We also don't know how long it lasts. And we're probably

254
0:25:22,880 --> 0:25:28,400
never going to do great studies on that. So really commit, get that first shot, get that second shot.

255
0:25:28,400 --> 0:25:36,800
I'm getting lots of vaccine questions. And so just to go through a few of them, still the

256
0:25:36,800 --> 0:25:42,240
lactation question is about fertility. But going forward, we're going to actually be

257
0:25:42,240 --> 0:25:47,920
hopefully just posting because the questions continue to flow on what are the different issues.

258
0:25:49,280 --> 0:25:54,160
I'm going to jump right from active to passive vaccination, which really sort of falls into the

259
0:25:54,160 --> 0:26:01,360
second stage back to monoclonal therapy. And here, again, it's a difficult issue. It's out there.

260
0:26:01,360 --> 0:26:05,920
I said with the active vaccines of the ones that are out there, only 10% have actually ended up

261
0:26:05,920 --> 0:26:12,400
in people's arms with the monoclonals. Only about 20% have ended up in people of the ones that are

262
0:26:12,400 --> 0:26:17,440
sent out. And it's a couple issues. One is an access problem with physicians, not the patients,

263
0:26:17,440 --> 0:26:20,880
right? You know, you call your physician, I'm not doing well. You've gotten a test.

264
0:26:20,880 --> 0:26:25,360
Physicians have been involved or health care providers have been involved. Physicians are either

265
0:26:25,360 --> 0:26:31,040
not able to understand how to access this. And the access is very easy, I want to say. I'm actually

266
0:26:31,040 --> 0:26:35,760
going to give you some numbers here. So if you're driving, you could pause, you could rewind.

267
0:26:35,760 --> 0:26:40,800
And don't crash and try to write this down while you're driving, even if you have a Tesla that

268
0:26:40,800 --> 0:26:46,400
is supposed to drive for you. And since a lot of this is our weekly information session for

269
0:26:46,400 --> 0:26:53,920
pro health and Riverside, Optum Tri-State, New York, we have a Long Island bamlinibimab hotline

270
0:26:53,920 --> 0:27:04,160
where people just dial 516-918-6089. Physician calls gives the history. And often they can get

271
0:27:04,160 --> 0:27:10,400
access to the medication the same day. Tensor being set up outside of ERs, other settings.

272
0:27:10,400 --> 0:27:17,920
And nationally to find out about the access in your area, it's 1-855-545-5921.

273
0:27:19,520 --> 0:27:25,360
This is just for Eli Lilly. But Regeneron is sort of right on the heels there. So I'll have

274
0:27:25,360 --> 0:27:30,960
to get access to those numbers once those roll out in our area as well. But what's going on here?

275
0:27:30,960 --> 0:27:36,480
A lot of doctors actually, and this sort of goes back, you know, they're not impressed with the

276
0:27:36,480 --> 0:27:43,360
data. This is an EUA based upon limited data, right? We just did phase 1 and 2. We thought it was

277
0:27:43,360 --> 0:27:48,480
really impressive. It rolled right into EUA. And a lot of physicians have said, you know, this is

278
0:27:48,480 --> 0:27:55,120
not an FDA approved drug. You've looked at it in a few hundred people as impressive as it might be,

279
0:27:55,120 --> 0:28:01,440
you know, with the Eli Lilly with about a 70 to 75% reduction in progression to requiring medical

280
0:28:01,440 --> 0:28:08,480
care in the Regeneron being maybe about a 50% with that cocktail. There really is still that

281
0:28:08,480 --> 0:28:13,360
question of does this stuff really work? So there is plans for a large EUA trial, which I will

282
0:28:13,360 --> 0:28:18,960
definitely share more about as soon as we get the green light from the FDA. Early inflammatory phase,

283
0:28:20,080 --> 0:28:25,280
you know, a reminder, I want to say that steroids are not indicated in the first week. They're not

284
0:28:25,280 --> 0:28:31,760
for everyone. Second week, people with hypoxemia. If we have listeners in parts of the world where

285
0:28:31,760 --> 0:28:40,160
there are co-infections, strungaloidies, malaria, asterisks, other other things going on, keep that

286
0:28:40,160 --> 0:28:47,040
in mind. You know, I think as my colleagues published back in July, if you're going to be using high

287
0:28:47,040 --> 0:28:52,080
dose steroids for any period of time, you've got to be thinking about what else might be going on

288
0:28:52,080 --> 0:28:57,280
there. This was a big change, right? Well, not that, but what I'm about to say is a big change.

289
0:28:57,840 --> 0:29:04,720
We're now sort of reinforced in our recommendation of prophylactic dosing of anticoagulations.

290
0:29:05,520 --> 0:29:09,840
So I think I mentioned before that I'm the infectious disease physician who was

291
0:29:11,040 --> 0:29:16,720
put up to be on the American Society hematology panel to work on the guidelines for how to use

292
0:29:16,720 --> 0:29:25,600
anticoagulation in COVID-19. And after much back and forth and going through 100 to 100 papers,

293
0:29:26,320 --> 0:29:32,560
the ash guideline panel suggested using prophylactic intensity over intermediate

294
0:29:32,560 --> 0:29:38,720
or therapeutic intensity anticoagulation in patients with COVID-19. That's for both critical

295
0:29:38,720 --> 0:29:43,040
and floor patients. But then they did say, so that's your baseline. If you're going to have

296
0:29:43,040 --> 0:29:47,680
an order set, you're going to start people on, let's say it's low venox, that would be your 40

297
0:29:47,680 --> 0:29:52,640
milligrams of sub-Q once a day would be your prophylactic intensity. You might adjust that

298
0:29:52,640 --> 0:30:00,240
based on weight if there's extremes variation there. But then saying on a case-by-case basis,

299
0:30:01,040 --> 0:30:06,720
the panel acknowledges that higher intensity anticoagulation may be preferred in certain patients

300
0:30:06,720 --> 0:30:13,440
judged to be at a high thrombotic risk and a lower acceptable bleeding risk, right? A couple

301
0:30:13,440 --> 0:30:20,000
trials, active, and there are actually three trials, where they were looking at prophylactic

302
0:30:20,000 --> 0:30:26,960
intermediate and therapeutic intensity anticoagulation. And in the patients that were in the intensive

303
0:30:26,960 --> 0:30:30,800
care unit, these are the ones that we think are at the highest risk of clotting, they actually

304
0:30:30,800 --> 0:30:37,520
stopped the routine full dose arms because they were actually seeing mortality impact. So basically

305
0:30:37,520 --> 0:30:43,360
stepping back to, I'll say the guidelines that we've recommended here. But I think this is a

306
0:30:43,360 --> 0:30:49,120
reminder, right? Because the COVID wars, so to speak, that were described in New York Times,

307
0:30:49,120 --> 0:30:53,680
there were physicians who were passionate that if you were not putting patients on full dose

308
0:30:53,680 --> 0:30:59,440
anticoagulation, you were killing them, you were letting them die for science so that you could

309
0:30:59,440 --> 0:31:05,360
just get your answers. And here, we're finally seeing some data. And I feel like this is

310
0:31:06,080 --> 0:31:09,760
solid data. This helps us. I think we're moving forward.

311
0:31:10,880 --> 0:31:16,800
Secondary infection phase. We've talked about this before. This is week three. Things start to go

312
0:31:16,800 --> 0:31:21,360
in the wrong direction. You want to start looking for, is there a bacterial infection? Are we having

313
0:31:21,360 --> 0:31:27,840
progression of the inflammatory process? Or are we starting to have a thromboembolic or

314
0:31:27,840 --> 0:31:33,520
thrombotic complication? Don't just think about bacteria, but also think about fungal issues.

315
0:31:35,120 --> 0:31:40,080
We see these, or we saw these more when people using anakinra here in the States,

316
0:31:40,080 --> 0:31:44,400
there certainly are a lot of these in a lot of other parts of the world, like what I described

317
0:31:44,400 --> 0:31:50,400
in India. In India, we're actually seeing a lot of, not just Canada, but we're actually seeing

318
0:31:50,400 --> 0:31:56,640
mu core, because people are just getting so many courses of antibiotics and high dose steroids

319
0:31:56,640 --> 0:32:02,080
that this set is setting them up for severe fungal infection. So look at the context here.

320
0:32:02,640 --> 0:32:06,640
Be careful with the antibiotics. Don't just keep overdoing it. We're going to lose all our

321
0:32:06,640 --> 0:32:14,880
antibiotics. And the steroids, you've got away the harms. If you have a 70 pound frail woman,

322
0:32:14,880 --> 0:32:18,960
maybe you don't even have to use the full six milligrams. You might drop down to four. I

323
0:32:18,960 --> 0:32:23,440
had a woman today that I put on steroids, but at four milligrams, I may not even go for the full

324
0:32:23,440 --> 0:32:28,480
10 days. So there is some customization here, the trial, six milligrams times 10 days.

325
0:32:28,480 --> 0:32:34,320
That isn't necessarily a one size fits all. That was just a study trying to get an answer

326
0:32:34,320 --> 0:32:39,920
to a specific question. Moving into the end of the segment, I'll say that, but also the tail phase

327
0:32:39,920 --> 0:32:46,400
and DC planning. I just want everyone to keep in mind that when these folks are clapped out the door,

328
0:32:47,200 --> 0:32:51,600
for a lot of these individuals, that isn't the end of COVID. There was a little bit of

329
0:32:51,600 --> 0:32:57,600
attention recently to the fact that if you look at the all-cause mortality, individuals discharged

330
0:32:57,600 --> 0:33:04,160
with COVID are about six times as likely to not be alive at two months post discharge compared

331
0:33:04,160 --> 0:33:09,200
to other conditions. About 10% of them will actually get out of the hospital, but then die

332
0:33:09,200 --> 0:33:16,000
in the next two months. About 15% will bounce right back to the hospital. So it's important.

333
0:33:16,000 --> 0:33:20,640
Don't just clap these people out and forget about them. They need ongoing care. They need

334
0:33:20,640 --> 0:33:26,960
monitoring. They need support. So let's finish off here. I'll say our fund raiser, but I'm going

335
0:33:26,960 --> 0:33:32,800
to sort of spend a little moment here. Our fund raiser, we're now helping to raise money for

336
0:33:33,360 --> 0:33:40,480
the Peace Corps, HIV and AIDS programs. We're all one year older and what have we done while

337
0:33:40,480 --> 0:33:49,520
we've been focusing on COVID, HIV, malaria, parasitic diseases, all these neglected diseases

338
0:33:49,520 --> 0:33:53,920
are really gaining ground. We worry and the estimates are that we may have lost about 10

339
0:33:53,920 --> 0:34:01,440
years. So this is devastating. So here kind of the end of the year, as we're all thinking

340
0:34:01,440 --> 0:34:06,000
about all these other things, help us continue to do our work because when we come out of the

341
0:34:06,000 --> 0:34:09,840
other side of this, there's really going to be a lot of work for us to do.

342
0:34:09,840 --> 0:34:14,960
Right. Thank you, Daniel. I have a couple of email for you. First one is from Bart,

343
0:34:14,960 --> 0:34:22,160
who is confused about PCR testing. He writes, I'm reading various articles suggesting that even

344
0:34:22,160 --> 0:34:26,960
four to five days after infection, note not symptom onset, but infection PCR tests still have

345
0:34:26,960 --> 0:34:33,920
notoriously poor sensitivity. 67% false negative four days after infection in one study. I'm confused.

346
0:34:33,920 --> 0:34:38,960
I understood that the onset of symptoms on average occurred for the bulk of patients around that

347
0:34:38,960 --> 0:34:44,640
time and that the viral load was at its peak just before and after infection symptom onset.

348
0:34:44,640 --> 0:34:50,160
I think PCR is incredibly sensitive if virus is present. So four or five days after infections,

349
0:34:50,160 --> 0:34:54,000
most patients should have enough detectable virus in the body. I thought a PCR test should

350
0:34:54,000 --> 0:35:00,080
be able to pick this up and write result in a positive test. So why are PCR tests reported to

351
0:35:00,080 --> 0:35:04,800
have such high false negative rates? And more importantly, if you're not exhibiting symptoms,

352
0:35:04,800 --> 0:35:10,080
when is the best time to get tested to increase the chance that the test will be correctly positive

353
0:35:10,080 --> 0:35:20,480
if you actually have been infected, please help. So this is well put out. This is not simple.

354
0:35:20,480 --> 0:35:25,600
And so I'm going to go through this a little bit of terminology here to hit on, but also

355
0:35:26,160 --> 0:35:31,280
people are going to have to have a graphic visual in their head. So what are the different terms

356
0:35:31,280 --> 0:35:35,600
here? So there's a point at which a person is exposed. This is the time of exposure.

357
0:35:35,600 --> 0:35:42,480
If you've been exposed and successfully infected, there is an incubation period,

358
0:35:42,480 --> 0:35:47,680
and that incubation period can be from two to 14 days. So you are infected. There is

359
0:35:47,680 --> 0:35:53,680
virus that is replicating. And anytime between two to 14 days, you may or may not get sick.

360
0:35:54,400 --> 0:36:01,200
50% of people never show symptoms. But let's use the symptomatic person as an example.

361
0:36:01,200 --> 0:36:07,040
So let's say you're going to be one of those people who takes the full 14 days before you

362
0:36:07,040 --> 0:36:11,920
get sick. You're going to get sick at day 14. That's about 2% or 3% of individuals will get sick

363
0:36:11,920 --> 0:36:18,080
in the last couple days of that window. The PCR will stay negative on you all the way out to

364
0:36:18,640 --> 0:36:25,280
about 2.4 days before symptom onset. So there's a little bit of a confusion here. What is infection

365
0:36:25,280 --> 0:36:30,080
and what is symptom onset? So the infection is the time that the virus actually gets into

366
0:36:30,080 --> 0:36:36,480
your cells and starts to replicate. It will stay below the level of detection for often many,

367
0:36:36,480 --> 0:36:42,720
many days between, I'm going to say here, one to about 12 days. Because if I say you get sick

368
0:36:42,720 --> 0:36:49,200
on day 14, you're probably starting to get detectable virus by 14. If you get symptoms,

369
0:36:49,840 --> 0:36:54,560
right at the time that you get symptoms is usually when people have, or typically when a person

370
0:36:54,560 --> 0:37:01,760
has the highest amount of RNA, and that's the point when a person has the highest likelihood of

371
0:37:01,760 --> 0:37:10,560
being picked up by one of our testing modalities. Once you get out to about five days post symptom

372
0:37:10,560 --> 0:37:18,240
onset, the virus has really come down. On the way up, it's about 2.4. On the way down, we think

373
0:37:18,240 --> 0:37:24,480
it comes down at about five. But then some people will be positive out to nine. A lot of people will

374
0:37:24,480 --> 0:37:29,680
start to turn PCR negative by day 10. So there's a couple of things going on here. When we talk

375
0:37:29,680 --> 0:37:35,120
about infection and this feeds into a test does not predict the future. You can be infected.

376
0:37:35,120 --> 0:37:42,240
You can be in the incubation period for out to 14 days. And at any point in time, a test will

377
0:37:42,240 --> 0:37:47,680
not predict what's going to happen the next day. In most cases, the virus comes up rather quickly

378
0:37:47,680 --> 0:37:53,200
within hours to a day. But now we've seen more kinetic studies where some people gradually come

379
0:37:53,200 --> 0:37:59,280
up over two days. The other is there may actually be an intermittent positivity, where someone's

380
0:37:59,280 --> 0:38:03,760
positive, negative, positive. We're usually not seeing that till we get down to the lower limit

381
0:38:03,760 --> 0:38:10,000
of detection. So people that have been sick for five plus days, then we'll often see that. Usually

382
0:38:10,000 --> 0:38:15,600
if you can get the CT values, the quantitative instead of the qualitative testing, they're going

383
0:38:15,600 --> 0:38:20,400
to be in the high 30s at that point. Next one is from Carolyn, who writes, it would be great if

384
0:38:20,400 --> 0:38:26,320
you could comment on very promising results with the SSRI fluvoxamine. It seems to act through the

385
0:38:26,320 --> 0:38:32,480
sigma one receptor in the ER, unrelated to serotonin reuptake inhibition and may impact cytokine

386
0:38:32,480 --> 0:38:38,320
secretion and or impact virus replication directly a small outpatient placebo controlled clinical

387
0:38:38,320 --> 0:38:43,120
trial was published in JAMA. There are more data accumulating and she gives some links.

388
0:38:43,120 --> 0:38:48,640
Steve Kirsch, who started the COVID Early Treatment Fund has funded some of the work. Thank you.

389
0:38:49,440 --> 0:38:53,040
Yeah, no, thanks for bringing that up. And I think this is a challenge. I was

390
0:38:54,080 --> 0:39:00,240
worried that I'm leaving things out. And I certainly, certainly am. There's a list of therapies

391
0:39:01,040 --> 0:39:08,720
that are being tried in COVID. And I don't know if I'm at a point where I feel like I have anything

392
0:39:08,720 --> 0:39:13,600
compelling that I can share other than what you did in your email, but we'll be keeping track of

393
0:39:13,600 --> 0:39:18,880
this. And when when something that I think is sort of ready for prime time is something is moving

394
0:39:18,880 --> 0:39:23,760
into practice, or when I'm working with physicians that are using these things and I can relate some

395
0:39:23,760 --> 0:39:28,720
firsthand experience, I will do that as well. All right, our last one is from Char, who writes,

396
0:39:28,720 --> 0:39:33,680
Dr. Griffin, if you keep missing your vitamin D doses, it's okay to take it weekly. If you choose

397
0:39:33,680 --> 0:39:39,520
to use 4,000 per day, you could take 28,000 units on Sunday, because it's an oil soluble

398
0:39:39,520 --> 0:39:43,920
vitamin. If you take it with food that contains some oil or fat, it should all get absorbed.

399
0:39:44,560 --> 0:39:49,840
Yes, an RCT of vitamin D and COVID would be great. But the paper you shared is compelling,

400
0:39:49,840 --> 0:39:56,160
and Dr. Sehult shared a reference list on MedCram, December 10. Also, vitamin D itself is very

401
0:39:56,160 --> 0:40:01,680
inexpensive. So the high cost you're talking about must be the tests and the prescription vitamin D.

402
0:40:01,680 --> 0:40:05,280
I'm always looking forward to your weekly updates so I can share the information. I want you to

403
0:40:05,280 --> 0:40:12,800
stay healthy and continue full steam ahead. And Char is an MD internist, mostly retired, but still

404
0:40:12,800 --> 0:40:18,640
helping where he can in Portland. And Daniel, he gives a number of other paragraphs,

405
0:40:19,600 --> 0:40:24,640
which I will not read, but you might be of interest experienced from his primary care

406
0:40:24,640 --> 0:40:32,160
practice with vitamin D. No, I appreciate it. I think I've been mentioned before. I've actually

407
0:40:33,200 --> 0:40:38,160
been interested in vitamin D for a while. And I love the story of the, I think I related this before,

408
0:40:38,160 --> 0:40:42,320
of the physician in London who was taking care of the Muslim women wearing burkas,

409
0:40:42,320 --> 0:40:48,240
they came with gate disturbances, he tied this to vitamin D. And I have gotten better. My vitamin

410
0:40:48,240 --> 0:40:54,080
D is now I sit it out right next to the toothbrush. So I'm trying to do a better job. I'm a

411
0:40:54,080 --> 0:41:00,080
pasty guy who spends way too much time indoors. So trying to get my vitamin D. My son Barnaby,

412
0:41:00,080 --> 0:41:05,120
he drinks like, I don't know, probably a gallon of vitamin D fortified milk a day. He's going to be

413
0:41:05,120 --> 0:41:11,200
okay. But hey, there still may be some vitamin D in the stockings. All right, that's COVID-19

414
0:41:11,200 --> 0:41:17,520
clinical update number 42 with Dr. Daniel Griffin. Thanks again, Daniel. Oh, thank you. Everyone,

415
0:41:17,520 --> 0:41:27,040
be safe.
