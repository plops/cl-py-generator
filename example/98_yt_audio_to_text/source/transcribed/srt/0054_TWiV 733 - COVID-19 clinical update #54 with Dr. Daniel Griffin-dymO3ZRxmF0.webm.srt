0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:06,880
This week in virology, the podcast about viruses, the kind that make you sick.

2
0:00:10,240 --> 0:00:21,040
From Microbe TV, this is Twiv, this week in virology, Episode 733, recorded on March 18, 2021.

3
0:00:21,680 --> 0:00:27,760
I'm Vincent Draconiello, and you're listening to the podcast All About Viruses. Joining me

4
0:00:27,760 --> 0:00:37,360
today from New York, Daniel Griffin. Hello, everyone. This is clinical update number 54.

5
0:00:37,360 --> 0:00:43,840
How's things going, Daniel? You know, I continue to be optimistic. You know, as I was saying the

6
0:00:43,840 --> 0:00:49,200
other day, you know, that we've said over time, it's, you know, it's a race, the vaccine against

7
0:00:49,200 --> 0:00:54,240
the virus, but, you know, that the governors are doing everything they can to help out the virus,

8
0:00:54,240 --> 0:01:02,160
right? So we are doing everything we can to ramp up the vaccinations. And I actually don't have

9
0:01:02,160 --> 0:01:08,640
people heard, but there have already been over a hundred million vaccine doses given out in the

10
0:01:08,640 --> 0:01:14,080
United States. We haven't quite got to 100 million people fully vaccinated, but we are cranking through

11
0:01:14,080 --> 0:01:20,160
the vaccines. I know a lot of our listeners, I don't know what percent at this point, are here

12
0:01:20,160 --> 0:01:25,280
on Long Island. Long Island has been a little bit of a vaccine desert, I have to say, but

13
0:01:25,920 --> 0:01:31,440
when this drops on Saturday on Friday, three mass vaccination sites will open on Long Island. So

14
0:01:32,160 --> 0:01:39,200
exciting stuff for getting getting people a lot more chance to get vaccinated. But I'm sort of

15
0:01:39,200 --> 0:01:43,760
jumping into my sit rep before my quote, but that's okay. We'll get to the quotation. We're sort of

16
0:01:43,760 --> 0:01:49,600
sitting on this plateau. And as I'll discuss a little bit later, what we're seeing as far as cases,

17
0:01:49,600 --> 0:01:55,600
we're seeing a disproportionate number of these in the younger population, so in kids. So we'll

18
0:01:55,600 --> 0:02:02,160
make sure we discuss that. But let's start with our quotation. And this is again, Eleanor Roosevelt.

19
0:02:03,120 --> 0:02:09,600
Great minds discuss ideas, average minds discuss events, small minds discuss

20
0:02:09,600 --> 0:02:14,560
people. And the reason I throw it out there, my whole hope is as we come out of this,

21
0:02:14,560 --> 0:02:21,200
that we learn what went wrong. And we learn what to do so that this never happens again.

22
0:02:21,920 --> 0:02:26,720
And I know a lot of the discussion is about people who did what wrong. I don't think we

23
0:02:26,720 --> 0:02:32,800
learn from that. Those people will probably not be here the next time around. But the lessons

24
0:02:32,800 --> 0:02:38,560
will be there. The events will be there. The ideas about how we can do better the next time. So

25
0:02:38,560 --> 0:02:44,880
I just want to throw that out there. I really do hope we learn from this. I do hope it doesn't

26
0:02:44,880 --> 0:02:50,480
become about just about blame and take the focus off the fact that this was a horrible thing that

27
0:02:50,480 --> 0:02:55,920
happened. This still is a horrible thing that is happening. But we can respond better the next time

28
0:02:55,920 --> 0:03:03,440
I do hope. So never miss an opportunity to vaccinate. Never miss an opportunity to test and never waste

29
0:03:03,440 --> 0:03:12,320
a vaccine dose. So as I mentioned, we're here on this plateau. Our plateau in New York is not

30
0:03:12,320 --> 0:03:18,080
as low a plateau as I would like. So we're sort of going against this with our vaccines.

31
0:03:18,800 --> 0:03:25,360
But as I mentioned, children and COVID, this has become a very hot topic. And the hottest topic

32
0:03:25,360 --> 0:03:32,240
I think this last week is three feet versus six feet. And I know I heard one of the physicians,

33
0:03:32,240 --> 0:03:38,480
scientists who was sort of discussing this saying, oh, this is just a distractor. But let me actually

34
0:03:38,480 --> 0:03:42,960
go into the weeds in this because I actually want to say that my involvement with schools,

35
0:03:42,960 --> 0:03:47,520
camps, different venues to get children sort of back into more of a normal situation.

36
0:03:48,480 --> 0:03:55,520
This actually is a critical issue. So what got this all being discussed? And there was a publication

37
0:03:55,520 --> 0:04:03,120
Effectiveness of three versus six feet of physical distancing for controlling spread of COVID-19

38
0:04:03,120 --> 0:04:09,600
among primary and secondary students and staff, a retrospective statewide cohort study. And this

39
0:04:09,600 --> 0:04:16,720
was published in CID. So one of the things I am going to say as I go through this is I do want

40
0:04:16,720 --> 0:04:23,200
our listeners as painful as it is to try to actually read this article. Because the headlines,

41
0:04:23,200 --> 0:04:29,520
I do not think really match with what's in this article. So let me discuss a little bit about

42
0:04:30,480 --> 0:04:41,600
what this article contained. So they reported on 251 eligible school districts. So 537,336

43
0:04:41,600 --> 0:04:50,480
students and 99,390 staff who attended in-person instruction during a 16-week period. And they

44
0:04:50,480 --> 0:04:57,280
gave us incidence rate ratios with confidence intervals. Now I'm going to focus on the students

45
0:04:57,280 --> 0:05:03,600
and not the staff, but there is data there on the staff. So they reported, this is sort of their

46
0:05:03,600 --> 0:05:10,560
conclusion, that student case rates were similar in the 242 districts with greater than three feet

47
0:05:10,560 --> 0:05:17,520
versus greater than six feet of physical distancing between the students. And they give us an IRR,

48
0:05:17,520 --> 0:05:26,560
an incident rate ratio of 0.891 with a really wide confidence interval. And the results were

49
0:05:26,560 --> 0:05:35,120
similar after they adjusted for community incidents. That came in 0.904 with, again, a wide confidence

50
0:05:35,120 --> 0:05:41,840
interval stretching from 0.6 all the way up to 1.325. And they concluded that they did not see any

51
0:05:41,840 --> 0:05:50,800
significant difference in the staff incident rate ratios. And also, as they say here with

52
0:05:50,800 --> 0:05:55,280
these wide confidence intervals, they couldn't show that there was any significant benefit to

53
0:05:55,280 --> 0:06:01,200
six feet versus three feet. Now let's go a little bit into this, because I think this paper will

54
0:06:01,200 --> 0:06:06,080
impact policy. So therefore, I think it's important that we spend a little time understanding how

55
0:06:06,080 --> 0:06:12,880
reliable this data is. So first off, this is not any kind of a prospective control trial,

56
0:06:12,880 --> 0:06:20,720
but rather was a retrospective analysis of publicly available data derived from case reporting to

57
0:06:20,720 --> 0:06:28,000
the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education. And they looked at publicly

58
0:06:28,000 --> 0:06:33,280
available district plans. I want to make the point here. This wasn't even an observational study.

59
0:06:33,280 --> 0:06:37,760
They actually didn't even go out and observe to see what was going on. They basically looked at

60
0:06:37,760 --> 0:06:42,080
what were the published plans. There was no verification what was actually going on.

61
0:06:42,800 --> 0:06:47,440
They just looked through the plans, and then they looked at some publicly reported

62
0:06:47,440 --> 0:06:53,120
case rates. So they looked and they said, OK, districts that permitted a minimum of greater than

63
0:06:53,520 --> 0:06:59,600
three feet in distancing, even if greater distances were preferred, they're going to classify them as

64
0:06:59,600 --> 0:07:07,120
the three feet group. Districts that allowed greater than three for some grades, but not all.

65
0:07:07,120 --> 0:07:12,560
Those were all classified as greater than three. Now, schools, the only ones that were greater

66
0:07:12,560 --> 0:07:17,920
than six schools that open in hybrid learning mode with requirements of greater than six feet

67
0:07:17,920 --> 0:07:23,840
in the hybrid model were classified as the greater than six feet physical distancing.

68
0:07:23,840 --> 0:07:31,280
Then what they tell us is of these over 500,000 students, they identified 4,226 cases.

69
0:07:31,280 --> 0:07:37,680
So of all these students, we are seeing reported positive cases to the Department

70
0:07:38,720 --> 0:07:42,480
of Health, based Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education

71
0:07:43,920 --> 0:07:49,440
that they had a case rate of 0.8%, right? So this is a very small number.

72
0:07:49,440 --> 0:07:54,160
A couple of things to also add. The majority of the campuses that did open had less than

73
0:07:54,160 --> 0:07:59,600
80% of enrolled students on campus. They do comment on the fact that active surveillance

74
0:07:59,600 --> 0:08:05,360
was rare, right? So we have to throw in what we learned from last time that the majority of cases

75
0:08:06,000 --> 0:08:13,040
in this age group are missed. They also lumped all the schools together and based their analysis

76
0:08:13,040 --> 0:08:18,160
on, as I mentioned, publicly available plans. There was no verification of what was the actual

77
0:08:18,160 --> 0:08:26,160
practice. And then what they saw was this rate ratio of 0.9% for six feet over three,

78
0:08:26,160 --> 0:08:32,800
but this really wide confidence interval. So I think the tough thing I had with this paper was,

79
0:08:32,800 --> 0:08:38,080
this falls into what I say of things that we want to be true or don't want to be true.

80
0:08:38,800 --> 0:08:42,880
And I don't think that there was anything here in the data that really gave us clarity on this

81
0:08:42,880 --> 0:08:50,320
issue. So what I did want to do was sort of bring people back to, I think, a paper that actually

82
0:08:50,320 --> 0:08:55,200
was a little bit better at giving us insight. What I looked at this paper and I said,

83
0:08:55,200 --> 0:09:00,000
people now want to say that we need three feet or three feet is fine compared to six feet.

84
0:09:00,000 --> 0:09:05,920
And the reason there's so much focus here is that most schools in our country,

85
0:09:05,920 --> 0:09:11,200
if six foot separation is required between the students, between the desks, that's going to

86
0:09:11,200 --> 0:09:17,600
prevent them from a full in-person opening, a sort of return to this full in-person class.

87
0:09:18,320 --> 0:09:22,720
So there really was, I want to say, sorry to the authors of that paper,

88
0:09:22,720 --> 0:09:28,320
but there was an excellent paper published in the Lancet back in June. And I think we've spent

89
0:09:28,320 --> 0:09:33,200
some time on this before, but I want to sort of bring people back to it. It's amazing that

90
0:09:33,200 --> 0:09:39,200
something in June is old news, but physical distancing, face masks, and eye protection to

91
0:09:39,200 --> 0:09:46,640
prevent person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, a systematic review and meta-analysis,

92
0:09:46,640 --> 0:09:52,240
right? So this was back in the Lancet. And the point this paper made, which is really something

93
0:09:52,240 --> 0:09:57,440
consistent with what we've learned over the years, is that there's a continuum to risk.

94
0:09:57,440 --> 0:10:04,160
There's no invisible barrier at six feet or at three feet. I still remember having a discussion

95
0:10:04,160 --> 0:10:09,360
with, I think it was a reporter back in April who really wanted to be within three feet of our

96
0:10:09,360 --> 0:10:16,720
friends, and six feet seemed excessive. Now in medicine, we talk about droplets, we talk about

97
0:10:16,720 --> 0:10:22,400
aerosols, we've looked at diseases like measles and laryngeal tuberculosis, where really an infected

98
0:10:22,400 --> 0:10:26,960
person comes into the office waiting room minutes later, just about every susceptible person is

99
0:10:26,960 --> 0:10:34,240
infected. Now influenza, in contrast, where a mask, distance, good ventilation really makes

100
0:10:34,240 --> 0:10:41,040
sitting across the room a much lower risk activity, right? And I know there was a lot of time spent,

101
0:10:41,040 --> 0:10:47,120
you know, is it airborne? What is an aerosol? You know, and I think we need to be careful of sort

102
0:10:47,120 --> 0:10:52,960
of getting mired down in the medical terminology. And I think there were in some quarters, and

103
0:10:52,960 --> 0:10:58,320
there still actually continues to be in many quarters, challenges with science communication

104
0:10:58,320 --> 0:11:04,720
around this issue. We've talked about larger droplets, which in some situations, in some

105
0:11:04,720 --> 0:11:08,880
percent of them will travel more than six feet, so they don't all drop magically.

106
0:11:10,560 --> 0:11:16,160
And some some virions, infectious virus particles, to use that as it's supposed to properly be used,

107
0:11:16,160 --> 0:11:22,320
I understand, they can actually be in those smaller size droplets. So nothing is black and white

108
0:11:22,320 --> 0:11:28,080
here. There are continuums here. But I think this translates into the fact that if you have poor

109
0:11:28,080 --> 0:11:36,160
ventilation, the law of averages is such that a small percentage of these smaller size particles

110
0:11:36,160 --> 0:11:41,680
that might have virions in them are going to start to build up in a room. So if you go back to this

111
0:11:41,680 --> 0:11:46,800
paper, and I'm going to say, you know, not all you're driving, but this was a good read, you can

112
0:11:46,800 --> 0:11:52,640
actually really see a beautiful figure where they show that the absolute risk really does drop in

113
0:11:52,640 --> 0:12:01,360
that first meter. So that 3.3 feet by about 80%. But then if you get out to about three meters,

114
0:12:01,360 --> 0:12:06,000
you're seeing you're getting down to about a 90% reduction. So you can see you get the most

115
0:12:06,000 --> 0:12:11,680
bang in that first meter, but you get even more in that second meter. So it's a continuum. We've

116
0:12:11,680 --> 0:12:17,920
talked before about how a mask drops our risk by about 80, 85%. We've talked about eye protection

117
0:12:17,920 --> 0:12:24,800
being associated with another drop in risk. And I know this study in Lancet didn't really spend

118
0:12:24,800 --> 0:12:30,720
much time on proper ventilation, but I think we can add that into the mix. So I think as we hear

119
0:12:30,720 --> 0:12:38,400
that the CDC is continuing 3 feet versus considering 3 feet versus 6 feet, what's really being considered

120
0:12:38,400 --> 0:12:45,840
is a full plan. If you have masks, if you have 3 feet, if maybe you put up plexiglass barriers,

121
0:12:45,840 --> 0:12:51,520
if you upgrade your ventilation system or have open windows, putting also into the equation

122
0:12:51,520 --> 0:12:58,000
community prevalence, we do know that schools, we think we know that we don't have a lot of

123
0:12:58,000 --> 0:13:04,000
actors surveillance that schools can be opened safely. We also know they can be kept closed and

124
0:13:04,000 --> 0:13:09,040
we also know they can be opened unsafely. So I think as we get into this decision, it's important

125
0:13:09,040 --> 0:13:14,480
to look at the science and balance our risks. And as we get into our tail end about long COVID,

126
0:13:14,480 --> 0:13:18,240
I'm going to be talking a little bit about long COVID in children again,

127
0:13:18,240 --> 0:13:22,000
because this is getting more attention and we're getting more stories about what's happening there.

128
0:13:22,880 --> 0:13:28,880
All right, let's move into testing. Testing is sort of a short section. I'm sort of

129
0:13:28,880 --> 0:13:35,520
a little bit dismayed at the drop in the amount of testing that is going on. If you actually go

130
0:13:35,520 --> 0:13:40,640
to these mass vaccination sites and you start asking the volunteers and the people working there,

131
0:13:40,640 --> 0:13:45,600
hey, what were you doing before you came and started working here, a lot of them were involved

132
0:13:45,600 --> 0:13:53,280
in the mass testing sites. So we're seeing a shift of resources, a shift of focus, a shift of energy

133
0:13:53,280 --> 0:13:59,920
from testing to vaccinations. And we still, if you look around, we're at a higher level now than we

134
0:13:59,920 --> 0:14:04,880
were during the quote unquote second peak of the summer in a lot of parts of our country. So

135
0:14:04,880 --> 0:14:10,080
we really have to continue having testing as part of our approach. And there really was a lot of

136
0:14:10,080 --> 0:14:14,560
money in that last plan that just came out to have testing as part of an approach. So

137
0:14:15,280 --> 0:14:20,000
there's been a lot of good work done on this. We actually did some like to think it was good work.

138
0:14:20,000 --> 0:14:25,360
It's now published. I'll have to tweet that out to everyone. But you can actually look at cases

139
0:14:25,360 --> 0:14:29,840
prevented, how much does it cost per case prevented, and particularly if someone else is paying for

140
0:14:29,840 --> 0:14:33,920
those testing bills, which is now what's supposed to be happening with this new stimulus bill,

141
0:14:33,920 --> 0:14:40,320
we can make testing part of a safe reopening plan. Active vaccination. We actually saw really

142
0:14:40,320 --> 0:14:46,160
encouraging data. And this was a big discussion before. If you're going to approach a disease

143
0:14:46,160 --> 0:14:51,680
with a double dose vaccination strategy, how many of those people are really going to come back

144
0:14:51,680 --> 0:14:59,440
for that second dose. So we saw a bit of information from the CDC and the MMWR COVID-19 vaccine,

145
0:14:59,440 --> 0:15:05,520
second dose completion, and interval between first and second doses among vaccinated persons,

146
0:15:05,520 --> 0:15:16,480
United States, December 14, 2020, February 14, 2021. And this was impressive. As per the CDC data,

147
0:15:16,480 --> 0:15:23,680
only about 3% of individuals are reported as missing that second dose. So this is, I have to

148
0:15:23,680 --> 0:15:29,360
say, very encouraging. This may even be, I'm going to venture to say even an overestimation,

149
0:15:29,360 --> 0:15:33,680
because we know a lot of individuals, maybe they went down to Florida, got that first dose,

150
0:15:33,680 --> 0:15:37,760
and then they came up to Massachusetts to complete their series, is the track and

151
0:15:37,760 --> 0:15:43,040
good enough to catch that they really got that second dose. What we're seeing, I think, is a

152
0:15:43,040 --> 0:15:48,480
really good uptake of people who get that first dose getting that second dose. So I have to say,

153
0:15:48,480 --> 0:15:53,520
this is really encouraging. The other thing I want to throw in here is something that we're

154
0:15:53,520 --> 0:15:59,360
getting more and more information about. We're hearing more and more confirmatory experiences

155
0:15:59,360 --> 0:16:08,320
of people with long COVID, go ahead, get vaccinated, and actually feel significantly better.

156
0:16:09,360 --> 0:16:14,080
This is something I started to notice early and early in January. I was a little bit worried,

157
0:16:14,080 --> 0:16:18,960
is this going to hold after that second dose? After the second dose, it's holding, which is

158
0:16:18,960 --> 0:16:24,480
pretty impressive. Say, my personal experience is probably about 30 or 40% of my patients.

159
0:16:24,480 --> 0:16:32,320
My wife was just asking me, is it still holding? And of course, today, I got a call from one of my

160
0:16:32,320 --> 0:16:40,960
patients who works in education, really a lot of difficulties, including, well, really, almost

161
0:16:40,960 --> 0:16:49,840
anything. She seems the hair loss, the fatigue, pretty significant cognitive issues, the brain fog,

162
0:16:49,840 --> 0:16:55,840
really concerned about her ability to function. Today, the call was just about a rash. And she

163
0:16:55,840 --> 0:17:01,440
said, boy, I really am continuing to improve. I'm continuing to feel better. So this is really

164
0:17:01,440 --> 0:17:08,080
exciting. We'll get maybe a little bit more ideas into why this is happening. We have a couple

165
0:17:08,080 --> 0:17:14,320
theories out there we don't know. But that is definitely exciting to see vaccine as therapeutic.

166
0:17:14,320 --> 0:17:19,680
We also have vaccine trials in children, and they're all up, they're getting filled, they're

167
0:17:19,680 --> 0:17:25,920
running forward. We actually heard that some of the vaccine trials are looking at going as low as

168
0:17:25,920 --> 0:17:33,600
children, as young, as six months of age. And this is fantastic. I think we've talked about,

169
0:17:33,600 --> 0:17:40,960
you know, will we ever reach this herd immunity? If we don't have vaccinations in our children,

170
0:17:40,960 --> 0:17:45,840
then it's going to be pretty challenging unless Peter Hotez wins over the hearts and minds of

171
0:17:45,840 --> 0:17:53,360
every single adult. Passive vaccination. This was an exciting, complicated,

172
0:17:53,360 --> 0:17:58,480
challenging last week, I have to say. So this last week, the US Department of Health and Human

173
0:17:58,480 --> 0:18:05,920
Services said it would limit distribution of BAM, linibimab, monotherapy, in a few of our states,

174
0:18:05,920 --> 0:18:12,960
California, Nevada, Arizona. And this was due to high levels of variants, hate those variants,

175
0:18:13,600 --> 0:18:20,400
that contained L452R, right? So they've got a mutation that seems to be impacting the efficacy

176
0:18:20,400 --> 0:18:28,960
of BAM linibimab, wanting us to switch over to cocktail treatment. Not only have we started to do

177
0:18:28,960 --> 0:18:35,440
that in those three states, but we've switched over almost all our sites, I have to say here in

178
0:18:35,440 --> 0:18:40,000
the tri-state area. So by the time this drops on Saturday, I think almost all the sites will

179
0:18:40,000 --> 0:18:47,920
successfully switch over. You know, in research, all our home infusion, we are rapidly switching

180
0:18:47,920 --> 0:18:52,480
everything over to cocktails. And I think I'll sort of explain, like, why are we doing that?

181
0:18:52,480 --> 0:18:58,960
Why not just these three or four states? We do not have the level of surveillance of the genetic

182
0:18:58,960 --> 0:19:06,640
sequence of the virus. So it was actually on a call to name Volta, who's my boss, at Optum Labs

183
0:19:06,640 --> 0:19:11,520
and Health Group. And she said, Daniel, you know, if your mother was in one of these states that

184
0:19:11,520 --> 0:19:16,480
does not have good surveillance, and she got COVID, would you want to give her the monotherapy,

185
0:19:16,480 --> 0:19:20,640
or would you want to give her the cocktail? And, you know, so we'll call that the mother test.

186
0:19:20,640 --> 0:19:25,360
And the mother test was, no, I would want my mother to get the cocktail. I think everyone

187
0:19:25,360 --> 0:19:31,120
should get the cocktail. Clearly, and David Ho sort of heads up about this, we're seeing

188
0:19:31,760 --> 0:19:36,880
the sequences in New York City, maybe a third or more. And that's actually from March 10th

189
0:19:36,880 --> 0:19:42,400
when he emailed me. We're already having resistance mutations that would suggest a lack of efficacy

190
0:19:42,400 --> 0:19:49,120
to bambling of a map. And we're seeing increasing rates around. So it's really a switch over to

191
0:19:49,120 --> 0:19:54,960
cocktails. We're going to go even a little more detail here, right, is the ID Society of America

192
0:19:54,960 --> 0:20:02,320
has now embraced monoclonal antibody therapy. But what have they embraced? It's very specific.

193
0:20:02,320 --> 0:20:09,200
They've embraced therapy with Eli Lilly cocktail, with bamlinivumab and a test of a map based upon

194
0:20:09,200 --> 0:20:16,320
those phase three trial results showing 87% reduction in progression, and that impact on

195
0:20:16,320 --> 0:20:21,120
mortality as well. So this last week was a challenge, right? Because the Catholic hospitals were the

196
0:20:21,120 --> 0:20:26,480
first ones to have cocktails. So we were flooding them. We had some pretty bad experiences with

197
0:20:26,480 --> 0:20:32,080
people waiting six, seven hours, sort of a monoclonal antibody line to get the cocktails,

198
0:20:32,080 --> 0:20:37,040
because we were not wanting them to get monotherapy with bam bam until everyone had switched over

199
0:20:37,040 --> 0:20:41,680
to cocktails. So fortunately, I think we are by the time this drops, we will have made the

200
0:20:41,680 --> 0:20:47,440
conversion across all over the place. So sort of tip my hat to everyone, sort of switching and

201
0:20:47,440 --> 0:20:54,720
doing what needed to be done to make this happen. All right. And now this is, I'm going to hopefully

202
0:20:54,720 --> 0:21:00,000
make this not as long as my other ones. We're going to spend a little bit of time on the tail

203
0:21:00,000 --> 0:21:06,640
phase before we go into our fundraiser and answer some emails. So I mentioned recently that things

204
0:21:06,640 --> 0:21:11,440
have been getting better and better with vaccination. But one of the things that has not been

205
0:21:11,440 --> 0:21:18,240
getting better is we're seeing lots and lots of COVID positive kits. And now what's getting a

206
0:21:18,240 --> 0:21:23,360
lot of attention is not just what we heard from the UK in terms of numbers, but we're hearing more

207
0:21:23,360 --> 0:21:29,520
and more stories. We're hearing more and more focus on children getting COVID and then not getting

208
0:21:29,520 --> 0:21:34,480
better. We don't know the exact percentages. I think I mentioned before, I don't want to hang

209
0:21:34,480 --> 0:21:41,120
my hat yet on what percent of children at what age end up with long COVID. But it is clearly

210
0:21:41,120 --> 0:21:47,280
more than we want to get long COVID. And the number of stories, the number of experiences

211
0:21:47,280 --> 0:21:52,000
that are being shared are growing. So this is going to have to factor into that discussion.

212
0:21:52,560 --> 0:21:56,800
I don't want to oversell this. I want to try to basically say this is what the science is.

213
0:21:57,680 --> 0:22:03,280
We know that children are at low risk of hospitalization. We know that children at low risk of death.

214
0:22:03,280 --> 0:22:09,840
We know that children are at lower risk seemingly for long COVID. But though children are at lower

215
0:22:09,840 --> 0:22:15,920
risk, they're not at no risk. So as we learn more and more about this, I think this needs to be

216
0:22:15,920 --> 0:22:20,560
part of that decision about letting the kids go back to school, letting the kids get back

217
0:22:20,560 --> 0:22:25,440
into all these activities, just realizing that you can't just say, oh, it doesn't matter if a child

218
0:22:25,440 --> 0:22:31,680
gets COVID because there can be consequences. So all right, as promised, I didn't keep people

219
0:22:31,680 --> 0:22:38,160
too long. But I do want to bring people to sort of my vision that I am concerned about.

220
0:22:38,160 --> 0:22:42,880
So I'm going to encourage everyone to go to parasiteswithoutporters.com and help us

221
0:22:42,880 --> 0:22:47,920
continue to support the American Society of Tropical Medicine. We're trying to create these

222
0:22:47,920 --> 0:22:54,320
scholarships, these annual meeting travel awards, for we're hoping to bring three women

223
0:22:55,200 --> 0:23:00,480
from economically challenged parts of the world to the annual meeting, trying to sort of help

224
0:23:00,480 --> 0:23:05,760
push them forward. I think it's really critical that we don't leave the rest of the world behind.

225
0:23:05,760 --> 0:23:12,320
What I fear is this sort of dystopian vision I have. It's December 4th, it's July 4th.

226
0:23:12,960 --> 0:23:18,880
We're celebrating Independence Day in the United States. We have massive numbers of people vaccinated.

227
0:23:19,440 --> 0:23:24,640
We're having our small gathering barbecues in the backyard, but still thousands of people

228
0:23:24,640 --> 0:23:30,800
are dying per day in many other parts of the world. So as we move, I think at a really good

229
0:23:30,800 --> 0:23:37,520
pace here towards vaccinating people here in the United States. I am glad to hear that we already

230
0:23:37,520 --> 0:23:43,840
have plans as we vaccinate people here to share those vaccines, to get those vaccines out to the

231
0:23:43,840 --> 0:23:50,400
rest of the world. So let's not just worry about ourselves. We're not safe until everyone's safe.

232
0:23:50,400 --> 0:23:56,960
Looking forward to understanding Daniel, how vaccinating resolves long COVID. That's a surprise

233
0:23:56,960 --> 0:24:07,760
to me. Email for Daniel, Daniel at microbe.tv. Martha, question regarding age and COVID vaccine

234
0:24:07,760 --> 0:24:12,000
dose. Does it seem that the elderly might need a larger dose than younger? If so, do you know of

235
0:24:12,000 --> 0:24:18,160
any plans to test this? Similarly, should younger people get a smaller dose? My elderly father has

236
0:24:18,160 --> 0:24:24,560
been asking about this. We'd love to find out the current thinking. It's always shocked me in

237
0:24:24,560 --> 0:24:29,840
medicine. This is the difference between the pediatrician and the adult physician. Once you

238
0:24:29,840 --> 0:24:37,920
turn 18, one size fits all. You could be that 75 pound woman. You could be the 320 pound

239
0:24:39,680 --> 0:24:46,640
man or woman, I guess. It's really amazing to me that we don't individualize that we haven't

240
0:24:46,640 --> 0:24:52,320
studied a lot of our medicines to really adjust. Some of them we have right now that we're using

241
0:24:52,320 --> 0:24:59,600
tosyllism for people that escalate. We clearly use a weight-based dosing. For our anticoagulation,

242
0:24:59,600 --> 0:25:05,520
we use a weight-based dosing. When we're looking at some of our antibiotics, we're actually looking

243
0:25:05,520 --> 0:25:09,760
at how much an individual weighs and we're dosing how many milligrams per kilogram.

244
0:25:10,400 --> 0:25:14,800
Most of our vaccines are one size fits all and the idea is we're going to overdose.

245
0:25:15,360 --> 0:25:20,320
But then we end up with discussions about vaccines. Oh, they work better in the young.

246
0:25:20,320 --> 0:25:26,720
They're less responsive in the older individuals. But we already saw with flu shots, for instance,

247
0:25:26,720 --> 0:25:33,120
maybe adjusting the preparation or the amount actually results in more protection.

248
0:25:33,920 --> 0:25:39,840
I think that's a lesson we've learned from the influenza vaccine story that it is worth looking

249
0:25:39,840 --> 0:25:46,960
at different doses, different formulations, definitely based upon a person's age, but also

250
0:25:46,960 --> 0:25:53,120
based maybe upon a person's size if we think about it. And I think that as we're more interested,

251
0:25:53,120 --> 0:25:58,640
more exciting of vaccines, I'm hoping we learn more about this. I actually remember one of our

252
0:25:58,640 --> 0:26:04,240
discussions when I was having my PhD was about really the difference in the immune system and

253
0:26:04,240 --> 0:26:12,160
the vaccine efficacy in children versus the elderly versus people in sort of between the two.

254
0:26:12,160 --> 0:26:18,240
And I'm supposed to say elderly or older individuals. But no, I think this is an excellent question,

255
0:26:18,240 --> 0:26:24,800
and these are unanswered questions. And if we keep seeing maybe treatment vaccine failures in

256
0:26:24,800 --> 0:26:30,080
people who are older, it might make sense to actually use increased doses in those individuals and

257
0:26:30,080 --> 0:26:35,360
study that. Walter writes, is there any known downside to any of the anti-sars COVID-2 spike

258
0:26:35,360 --> 0:26:42,080
protein vaccines for older kidney patients who do not yet require dialysis? I imagine vaccination

259
0:26:42,080 --> 0:26:48,240
produces at least some antibodies against the ACE2 spike protein complex that could engender

260
0:26:48,240 --> 0:26:53,280
cross reactivity against ACE2 receptors, the heart kidney and lungs are rich in those.

261
0:26:53,280 --> 0:26:59,280
I noticed that kidney patients were not included in the original Pfizer biotech or Moderna vaccine

262
0:26:59,280 --> 0:27:06,080
trials and have wondered why. Yeah, they weren't. That's a good observation. They have been clearly

263
0:27:06,080 --> 0:27:11,360
included in the millions of people that are now being vaccinated. So we have good experience

264
0:27:11,360 --> 0:27:16,160
in this population. They tend to be tolerating the vaccines very well. We're not seeing any

265
0:27:16,160 --> 0:27:21,280
safety concerns. So if someone has kidney problems, even if they're on dialysis, we're not seeing

266
0:27:21,280 --> 0:27:27,760
concerns. So dialysis, no dialysis. If you've got a place to get that vaccine, go ahead and get that

267
0:27:27,760 --> 0:27:32,160
vaccine. All right, one more from Thomas. Our facilities are beginning to revisit policies for

268
0:27:32,160 --> 0:27:38,480
pre-operative SARS-CoV-2 testing, as well as reconsidering wait times in our ORs after aerosol

269
0:27:38,480 --> 0:27:44,240
generating procedures. For roughly the last year, we've been testing all our elective surgical

270
0:27:44,240 --> 0:27:49,840
patients within 72 hours of their procedures and asking them to isolate following their testing

271
0:27:49,840 --> 0:27:55,200
until day of surgery to reduce both the risks associated with an infected patient coming to

272
0:27:55,200 --> 0:28:00,080
this hospital surgery center and spreading SARS-CoV-2 and more importantly, the risks of increasing

273
0:28:00,080 --> 0:28:07,200
complications with a patient to have pre-op COVID-19, perioperative. Additionally, we have had

274
0:28:07,200 --> 0:28:12,480
various wait times after both intubation, extubation or other aerosolizing procedures,

275
0:28:12,480 --> 0:28:18,960
depending on air exchange rates. Proposals are to one, eliminate pre-op testing in fully vaccinated

276
0:28:18,960 --> 0:28:24,480
patients to decrease or eliminate wait times after AGPs of patients are either vaccinated or have

277
0:28:24,480 --> 0:28:29,680
tested negative. The latter certainly goes against our current practice. Since all elective cases

278
0:28:29,680 --> 0:28:33,760
for the last many months would have had negative pre-op tests and we currently do wait for the

279
0:28:33,760 --> 0:28:38,640
requisite number of air exchanges prior to opening the rooms up. The vast majority of the staff has

280
0:28:38,640 --> 0:28:43,360
been fully vaccinated since early to mid-February, so risk of serious disease in our staff shouldn't

281
0:28:43,360 --> 0:28:48,480
really be the concern. Since some facilities have 14-minute pre and post wait, you can imagine

282
0:28:48,480 --> 0:28:54,000
efficiency isn't what it was pre-pandemic. Admittedly, item one goes against your mantra

283
0:28:54,000 --> 0:28:59,840
never miss an opportunity to test, but I suspect the risks are at least markedly reduced. Given

284
0:28:59,840 --> 0:29:05,680
the current CDC recommendations regarding travel for vaccinated people, it sounds like data still

285
0:29:05,680 --> 0:29:11,920
lacking to definitively be say vaccinated individuals can't transmit to other people. Curious if you

286
0:29:11,920 --> 0:29:16,160
and your crew have any thoughts on these proposed changes. Do you have any thoughts on if there

287
0:29:16,160 --> 0:29:24,400
is an ideal time to schedule a COVID-19 vaccination either before or after a planned elective surgery?

288
0:29:24,400 --> 0:29:30,240
We have administrators and high proclaiming patients shouldn't receive a vaccination for 14 days before

289
0:29:30,240 --> 0:29:35,280
or after the scheduled surgery. I've heard surgeons proclaim you could get a fever from the vaccine

290
0:29:35,280 --> 0:29:40,320
and might mimic a surgical side infection. And similarly, others have worried about side effects

291
0:29:40,320 --> 0:29:45,280
mimicking COVID and leading to postponement. I tend to err on the side of never miss an

292
0:29:45,280 --> 0:29:49,760
opportunity to vaccinate. So that was a lot there. That was like a that was like a

293
0:29:49,760 --> 0:29:58,560
Twip email, right? So let me pick the winners out. Maybe I'll go in reverse order and then I'll

294
0:29:58,560 --> 0:30:05,760
like remember as I go. So one of the things that definitely has been an issue is surgeons do not

295
0:30:05,760 --> 0:30:11,520
like us vaccinating anywhere around when they might be doing surgery, particularly the cancer

296
0:30:11,520 --> 0:30:16,720
surgeons. They're all worried that if we vaccinate particularly with an mRNA vaccine, particularly in

297
0:30:16,720 --> 0:30:22,320
the field, let's say you've got a woman who has breast cancer in her left breast and you're going

298
0:30:22,320 --> 0:30:28,400
to stick an mRNA shot into the left deltoid and then potentially have the enlarged lymph nodes

299
0:30:28,400 --> 0:30:33,440
that we clearly see. That might be an issue when they want to do lymph node dissection,

300
0:30:33,440 --> 0:30:38,640
sentinel, lymph node sampling, all these other things. And then that actually is reasonable.

301
0:30:39,360 --> 0:30:42,480
And this is complicated, right? So it can be very hard on a

302
0:30:42,480 --> 0:30:48,560
Twip to give the full answer. But yeah, there certainly are circumstances where I would defer

303
0:30:48,560 --> 0:30:53,440
that vaccine. I know that breaks my rule, but never missed a chance to immunize. Yeah, there

304
0:30:53,440 --> 0:30:57,920
are times when you're not missing the opportunity, you're moving that opportunity to a different

305
0:30:57,920 --> 0:31:03,760
time. Now we have started in the New York area, giving the J and J vaccine to a lot of patients

306
0:31:03,760 --> 0:31:09,520
before they leave. I do not think you need to wait a full 14 days. Much seems to be a much lower

307
0:31:09,520 --> 0:31:15,520
incidence of fever and tolerance issues. So in this case, I actually have a patient right now.

308
0:31:15,520 --> 0:31:22,400
She's in the hospital. She had a biopsy for her breast cancer. And we're actually going to go

309
0:31:22,400 --> 0:31:29,760
ahead and give her the J and J vaccine in the opposite arm before she leaves. And I think that

310
0:31:29,760 --> 0:31:36,000
this is going to have to be sort of an individual thought out. But I actually would not want there

311
0:31:36,000 --> 0:31:41,360
to be this hard and fast rule for any vaccine. If someone's planning on a hernia operation and

312
0:31:41,360 --> 0:31:47,040
they've got a chance to get a vaccine and it's 13, 12, 11 days before, I'm not sure we want to have

313
0:31:47,760 --> 0:31:51,520
too many barriers. We want to get those people vaccinated. Because unfortunately,

314
0:31:51,520 --> 0:31:57,120
when they come into a healthcare setting, we, sorry to say, have had exposure events.

315
0:31:57,120 --> 0:32:01,040
And so I think we want to be careful. We don't want to have rigid rules there.

316
0:32:01,040 --> 0:32:07,440
Now, the next is about testing. Hey, we have more and more testing capacity. We have quicker

317
0:32:07,440 --> 0:32:13,440
turnaround. Those whole ideas about getting your test 72 hours ahead of time were in large part

318
0:32:13,440 --> 0:32:20,560
based upon testing delays. If anything, I think we can ramp this up and have the day before

319
0:32:21,520 --> 0:32:26,480
get a test and have results available in time for that surgery. We really do not want people

320
0:32:26,480 --> 0:32:32,160
coming in, bringing them into healthcare settings, potentially exposing people who are

321
0:32:32,160 --> 0:32:36,640
immunocompromised, who maybe wanted to get vaccinated, but didn't have an opportunity to.

322
0:32:36,640 --> 0:32:41,760
I know we're all vaccinated, healthcare workers who wanted to. But a lot of our patients have

323
0:32:41,760 --> 0:32:45,920
not been vaccinated. And I think that's going to be an issue for a while either through choice

324
0:32:45,920 --> 0:32:49,920
or because they have an issue with an immune system failing. So I think we still have a

325
0:32:49,920 --> 0:32:56,240
commitment to try to keep our healthcare settings as safe as possible. It was related a story today.

326
0:32:56,240 --> 0:33:03,360
Unfortunately, where one of my good friends, his son had a skiing accident. They went to a hospital

327
0:33:03,360 --> 0:33:09,680
near the ski mountain. They wanted to do a CAT scan because they were concerned about head trauma.

328
0:33:10,640 --> 0:33:14,720
And the dad asked, well, why is this taking so long? And they said, oh, we just had a person

329
0:33:14,720 --> 0:33:18,400
in the CT scanner with COVID. We're just going to give it a few more minutes before we put

330
0:33:18,400 --> 0:33:23,920
your son in there. Five days later, the son started feeling poorly. He started feeling poorly.

331
0:33:23,920 --> 0:33:29,120
The wife started feeling poorly. That was the only exposure they could really think about was

332
0:33:29,120 --> 0:33:34,640
all that time spent in a healthcare setting. So we got to keep those places safe. It's a small

333
0:33:34,640 --> 0:33:40,800
price to pay to continue to test to keep these places safe. And not only is a small price to say,

334
0:33:40,800 --> 0:33:44,400
I'm going to say it's going to destroy the confidence. People are going to fear going to

335
0:33:44,400 --> 0:33:50,720
healthcare settings if we can't keep them safe for them. I think that was most of it.

336
0:33:50,720 --> 0:33:58,560
Yeah, I think that's great. All right, that's COVID-19 clinical update number 54 with Dr. Daniel

337
0:33:58,560 --> 0:34:04,320
Griffin. Thank you, Daniel. My pleasure is always on everyone. Be safe. We're coming to the end of

338
0:34:04,320 --> 0:34:09,440
this. You do not want to get sick now. There's lots of virus out there. We're sitting on a pretty

339
0:34:09,440 --> 0:34:21,680
high plateau. Get vaccinated. Don't get COVID. Stay positive, but stay negative.
