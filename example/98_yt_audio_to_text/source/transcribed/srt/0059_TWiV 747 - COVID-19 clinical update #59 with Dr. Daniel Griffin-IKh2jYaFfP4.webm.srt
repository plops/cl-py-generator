This week in virology, the podcast about viruses, the kind that make you sick.

2
0:00:10,320 --> 0:00:21,200
From MicrobeTV, this is Twiv, this week in virology, episode 747 recorded on April 22, 2021.

3
0:00:21,920 --> 0:00:28,320
I'm Vincent Racken-Yellow, and you're listening to the podcast All About Viruses. Joining me today

4
0:00:28,320 --> 0:00:37,280
from New York, Daniel Griffin. Hello, everyone. Well, as you requested, Daniel, you got the 747,

5
0:00:37,280 --> 0:00:44,320
so you can have the upper deck. Okay, I'm very, I'm very excited. So we are Twiv 747. What

6
0:00:44,320 --> 0:00:50,960
clinical update number are we up to? This is clinical update number 59. Okay, wow. All right.

7
0:00:52,240 --> 0:00:57,600
You know, I always have this. It's actually a rear current hope that I will have nothing to

8
0:00:57,600 --> 0:01:03,520
talk about, but fortunately that hope is yet to come to pass. So let me start with my quotation.

9
0:01:03,520 --> 0:01:09,680
We have a lot to cover today. Unfortunately, we have not run out of things to talk about.

10
0:01:09,680 --> 0:01:16,080
And we'll start off with a quotation from Hegel. And I've seen several sort of versions of this,

11
0:01:16,080 --> 0:01:22,720
but this one I think is sort of straight to the point. And we learn from history that we do not

12
0:01:22,720 --> 0:01:28,720
learn from history. I think that that's fortunately a little prescient with how we are doing now.

13
0:01:28,720 --> 0:01:35,680
And I'm hoping that at one point we're going to break from that. So last week, I talked about

14
0:01:35,680 --> 0:01:42,400
the impact that COVID has had on healthcare workers here in the US. And when I look at what's

15
0:01:42,400 --> 0:01:47,680
going on around the world, it actually seems like things are pretty good, you know, here in the US

16
0:01:47,680 --> 0:01:54,400
by comparison. But I was on a call recently with a physician in his 60s, right? Most physicians

17
0:01:54,400 --> 0:02:00,000
tend to work for quite a number of years into their later years. I think it takes us so much time

18
0:02:00,000 --> 0:02:06,160
and training to get there. But this gentleman in his 60s told me that he was retiring this spring.

19
0:02:06,160 --> 0:02:12,320
And it really occurred to me that it seemed like many of my colleagues more than sort of in a

20
0:02:12,320 --> 0:02:18,000
usual year have been mentioning that they're either have retired or planning on retiring

21
0:02:18,880 --> 0:02:24,480
in the coming months. And so it was actually a poll I just saw today, so hot off the press.

22
0:02:25,120 --> 0:02:31,440
And this was a poll done by the Washington Post and the Kaiser Family Foundation,

23
0:02:31,440 --> 0:02:37,600
Frontline Healthcare Worker Survey. And they actually found that about 30% of healthcare workers

24
0:02:37,600 --> 0:02:43,600
polled sort of right at this point in time were considering no longer working in healthcare.

25
0:02:44,160 --> 0:02:48,000
And William Blond wrote a really what I thought was an excellent piece in the Washington Post

26
0:02:48,000 --> 0:02:54,000
about this titled burned out by the pandemic, three in 10 healthcare workers consider leaving

27
0:02:54,000 --> 0:02:59,920
the profession. And some of the quotations I found to be actually very emotional and actually sort of

28
0:02:59,920 --> 0:03:05,680
in line with some of the experiences that my colleagues have shared with me. So I thought I'd

29
0:03:05,680 --> 0:03:10,880
just start off with this. You feel expendable. You can't help thinking about how this country

30
0:03:10,880 --> 0:03:14,880
sent us to the front lines with none of the equipment needed for the battle said Sharon

31
0:03:14,880 --> 0:03:22,240
Griswald, an emergency room doctor in Pennsylvania. Most of us got into this to save lives. But when

32
0:03:22,240 --> 0:03:26,880
death is blowing around you like a tornado and you can't make it that in any of it, it makes

33
0:03:26,880 --> 0:03:32,960
your question whether you're making any difference said Megan Brunson, a night shift nurse Dallas.

34
0:03:32,960 --> 0:03:40,160
So continues to be tough. I saw a lot of discussion about physicians being a bit frustrated feeling

35
0:03:40,160 --> 0:03:45,120
like, you know, we've done so much and been through through so much. And we ask little things like

36
0:03:45,120 --> 0:03:51,920
would people wear masks? Would they give us a little more time? And people are not necessarily

37
0:03:51,920 --> 0:03:57,040
willing to do the little things like wearing a mask and making smarter decisions. So, you know,

38
0:03:57,040 --> 0:04:02,960
big focus this last week has been on the J&J pause. So I will get back. We'll spend some time on that.

39
0:04:04,000 --> 0:04:08,640
Children in COVID, there is continued attention to the risk benefit of COVID

40
0:04:09,280 --> 0:04:15,680
and decisions around children. Summer's approaching and I don't know if our listeners know, but I

41
0:04:15,680 --> 0:04:23,680
do a lot of advising for for camps for summer programs, schools as well. I really feel like

42
0:04:23,680 --> 0:04:28,160
there are important decisions to be made here and I'm almost trying to provide information about

43
0:04:28,160 --> 0:04:33,280
that. So as we go forward, I'm going to make sure we get back to these important decisions.

44
0:04:34,160 --> 0:04:42,880
Basically, what can we do to make these activities a safe option, safe choice for our parents,

45
0:04:42,880 --> 0:04:52,320
for our kids, pre exposure period. So here's an article SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity and subsequent

46
0:04:52,320 --> 0:04:58,560
infection risk in healthy young adults, a prospective study. So this was the Lancet.

47
0:04:59,120 --> 0:05:02,720
And I think we discussed a little bit about this when it was out in pre-print, but it's no,

48
0:05:02,720 --> 0:05:10,400
no, out there published. So this analysis was performed as part of the prospective COVID-19

49
0:05:10,400 --> 0:05:17,440
health action response for Marines study. Charm, this acronym there. It was predominantly looking

50
0:05:17,440 --> 0:05:27,280
at male US Marine recruits aged 18 to 20. So 92% of these were men, just really at sort of the makeup

51
0:05:27,280 --> 0:05:36,240
of these US Marine recruits, 8% were women. They enrolled 3,249 participants. And it was a mix.

52
0:05:36,240 --> 0:05:43,120
Some of them had had COVID before and were seropositive. Some were not. So they looked specifically

53
0:05:43,120 --> 0:05:50,880
at the 189 seropositive individuals. They went through a whole sort of recruitment like quarantine

54
0:05:50,880 --> 0:05:55,680
process. They made sure they were negative. They kept them for two weeks in a sort of quarantine,

55
0:05:55,680 --> 0:06:02,880
with checking PCRs, really wanting to verify that when they entered trading, they were not PCR

56
0:06:02,880 --> 0:06:06,400
positive. I don't think they were doing this because they were trying to do a study. They

57
0:06:06,400 --> 0:06:10,320
were doing this because they were trying to prevent an outbreak. But unfortunately, there was an

58
0:06:10,320 --> 0:06:18,320
outbreak. And among these 189 seropositive participants, young, healthy, mostly males,

59
0:06:19,360 --> 0:06:26,080
10% of them went ahead to become PCR positive during a six week follow up. So I just want to

60
0:06:26,080 --> 0:06:29,680
sort of point that out to people, you know, people say, Oh, you're at low risk. Actually,

61
0:06:29,680 --> 0:06:36,400
here were zero positive young healthy individuals, 10% of them went ahead and actually were re-infected

62
0:06:36,400 --> 0:06:43,360
during a six week follow up period. This was a lower percentage than the people who were

63
0:06:43,360 --> 0:06:48,240
seronegative and had never had it before. And they actually go ahead and conclude. And they say,

64
0:06:48,240 --> 0:06:54,320
although anybody's induced by initial infections are largely protective, they do not guarantee

65
0:06:54,320 --> 0:07:00,400
effective SARS-CoV-2 neutralization activity or immunity against subsequent infection.

66
0:07:00,400 --> 0:07:08,480
So my takeaway among this was that, yeah, young fit adults can get re-infected even with positive

67
0:07:08,480 --> 0:07:14,160
antibody tests. So 10% went right ahead to get re-infected despite having those antibodies.

68
0:07:15,760 --> 0:07:21,440
Just a little more support as if we don't as if we needed or don't for people to go ahead

69
0:07:21,440 --> 0:07:27,840
and get infected. I go ahead and get vaccinated, not infected. You know, I see this and I'm hearing

70
0:07:27,840 --> 0:07:33,360
it, you know, patients now, I just try to ask like, so hey, you know, here we are. It's April.

71
0:07:33,360 --> 0:07:38,560
You're on the menu to the hospital with COVID. What was the story with the vaccine?

72
0:07:39,520 --> 0:07:43,920
And I keep hearing, oh, I was told I was supposed to wait. I think maybe back in January, I might

73
0:07:43,920 --> 0:07:50,160
have had COVID. So I'm waiting. I'm told I'm supposed to wait like, you know, a period of time. So,

74
0:07:50,160 --> 0:07:55,760
you know, don't wait. Do not miss your opportunity to get vaccinated. Don't go to the doctor and

75
0:07:55,760 --> 0:08:00,800
follow your antibody levels thinking that that offers some evidence that you're not going to get

76
0:08:00,800 --> 0:08:10,240
infected. I had an individual recently, you know, to say it's an older individual. They were

77
0:08:10,240 --> 0:08:16,880
they were infected in January, you know, and here they are back. It's April and they're in the

78
0:08:16,880 --> 0:08:22,960
hospital. So just just want to want to say that those positive antibody tests are not really a way

79
0:08:22,960 --> 0:08:28,880
for you to decide not to worry and and to wait to get vaccinated. Transmission. Now people are

80
0:08:28,880 --> 0:08:34,800
very passionate about this topic and I'm always happy to return here. It gets both love and mostly

81
0:08:34,800 --> 0:08:41,520
hate mail. What do we call that? That is constructive criticism, which we in science communication

82
0:08:41,520 --> 0:08:47,120
are supposed to develop a skill at handling. What we have learned and what we discussed last

83
0:08:47,120 --> 0:08:53,520
with was that the virus is rarely transmitted by surfaces. I think everyone is very comfortable

84
0:08:53,520 --> 0:09:01,120
with this sort of calculation. The CDC is suggesting that perhaps maybe one in every 10,000 cases

85
0:09:01,120 --> 0:09:08,080
was due to fomites or surface transmission. I actually think my my favorite, most accurate and

86
0:09:08,080 --> 0:09:14,880
perhaps least controversial statement by the CDC moves on to COVID-19 is most commonly

87
0:09:14,880 --> 0:09:21,200
spread during close contact and can also spread by airborne transmission. And this is from the

88
0:09:21,200 --> 0:09:28,640
CDC page how COVID-19 spreads last updated October 28, 2020. So really nothing new right there, but

89
0:09:28,640 --> 0:09:36,160
just it has been acknowledged that airborne transmission is a possible way that people can get COVID-19.

90
0:09:36,160 --> 0:09:40,000
For healthcare settings, it's important for us to understand when airborne transmission could

91
0:09:40,000 --> 0:09:45,680
occur. And I've tried repeatedly to return to situations outside healthcare settings where we

92
0:09:45,680 --> 0:09:51,840
are seeing this as an issue. So this is the classic suburban home, where as the CDC points out,

93
0:09:51,840 --> 0:09:57,040
these transmissions occurred within enclosed spaces that had inadequate ventilation.

94
0:09:57,040 --> 0:10:01,600
Sometimes the infected person was breathing heavily, for example, while singing or exercising.

95
0:10:01,600 --> 0:10:07,920
A little more information on masks. We saw a research letter fitted filtration efficiency of

96
0:10:07,920 --> 0:10:13,840
double masking during the COVID-19 pandemic. This was published in JAMA Internal Medicine

97
0:10:13,840 --> 0:10:21,600
April 16th. And the authors looked at double masking. They were reporting on fitted filtration

98
0:10:21,600 --> 0:10:28,320
efficacy, FFE. Now, what is that? They explained and I quote in brief, FFE corresponds to the

99
0:10:28,320 --> 0:10:33,920
concentration of particles behind the mask expressed as a percentage of the particle concentration in

100
0:10:33,920 --> 0:10:39,520
a sodium chloride particle enriched chamber measured during a series of repeated movements of the

101
0:10:39,520 --> 0:10:45,120
torso head and facial muscles as outlined by the occupational safety and health administration

102
0:10:45,120 --> 0:10:51,200
quantitative fit testing protocol. Yeah, did anyone really get that? Basically, what they're

103
0:10:51,200 --> 0:10:57,520
doing is they're having people move all around and they're measuring how much gets through the mask,

104
0:10:57,520 --> 0:11:02,640
sort of a percentage of what's outside and what gets sucked in through the mask. This is actually

105
0:11:02,640 --> 0:11:08,800
interesting. This is looking at masks protecting you where previously we've discussed a lot about

106
0:11:08,800 --> 0:11:15,520
masks protecting other people. And as altruistic as I know all our listeners are, a lot of listeners

107
0:11:15,520 --> 0:11:20,960
are interested in how well do the masks protect us. We are not measuring what gets out into the

108
0:11:20,960 --> 0:11:27,200
environment, but what gets sucked in through the mask or masks. And they concluded that wearing a

109
0:11:27,200 --> 0:11:35,680
medical procedure mask underneath a cloth mask provided the best improvement to FFE of all the

110
0:11:35,680 --> 0:11:42,080
combinations they evaluated. They reported that if you're wearing one of these procedure masks,

111
0:11:42,080 --> 0:11:47,600
and then you go add a single cloth mask over one of these medical masks, which actually people

112
0:11:47,600 --> 0:11:54,320
can now buy you can order them. They're these sort of blown weaved masks. You get an additional

113
0:11:54,320 --> 0:12:00,880
four to 14% protection by putting that over there. But what they point out, and I think I try to

114
0:12:00,880 --> 0:12:07,840
harp on this as well, it's really fit, not so much material that is really a critical factor in

115
0:12:07,840 --> 0:12:16,640
masks protecting us. Now, the study had limitations. It was only done on, as they say, one female

116
0:12:16,640 --> 0:12:22,960
volunteer and two male volunteers with shaven faces. I thought that was interesting. They didn't

117
0:12:22,960 --> 0:12:30,560
have the comment there about the female volunteer. It's also not the result I wanted, right? I have

118
0:12:30,560 --> 0:12:35,280
to say, I wear a mask. I hate to have to wear two masks. I would have preferred it if they

119
0:12:35,280 --> 0:12:40,080
demonstrated that just wearing that procedure mask was great stuff. But that's the problem

120
0:12:40,080 --> 0:12:43,920
with science. You get the truth, not confirmation of what you want to be the truth.

121
0:12:43,920 --> 0:12:48,720
I thought I would throw a case in here of a woman that I'm currently taking care of who is

122
0:12:48,720 --> 0:12:56,320
100 years old. She's in the hospital. And I was asking, what happened? Who went to kindergarten

123
0:12:56,320 --> 0:13:01,120
and learned that they should share? And she described that she was living in her home.

124
0:13:01,840 --> 0:13:06,320
She was waiting to get vaccinated because she just hadn't been able to navigate the system.

125
0:13:07,040 --> 0:13:14,000
And then one of her family members who had COVID came to visit her. This family member visited

126
0:13:14,000 --> 0:13:20,080
her indoors. She actually said it was about 20 minutes. They were nice and close. They were

127
0:13:20,080 --> 0:13:25,920
within that six foot zone. Nobody was wearing a mask. And yes, about five days later, she started

128
0:13:25,920 --> 0:13:34,720
to feel poorly, went on to test positive for COVID. And now she's in the hospital on increasing

129
0:13:34,720 --> 0:13:41,440
amounts of oxygen, nuanced at atrial fibrillation. She's now developed delirium. So this is the

130
0:13:41,440 --> 0:13:46,480
story we usually hear, right, is that two people are within a certain period of time. The suburban

131
0:13:46,480 --> 0:13:51,440
home is really a death trap. And they're not wearing masks. And I'm not quite sure I understand

132
0:13:51,440 --> 0:13:57,280
why someone who has COVID would be visiting their 100 year old family member testing. Never miss an

133
0:13:57,280 --> 0:14:04,160
opportunity to test. It's been a long time coming, but we now have access to in-home rapid antigen

134
0:14:04,160 --> 0:14:12,000
testing, thanks to bynex. Now we have this $25 test available here in the US. Recently,

135
0:14:12,000 --> 0:14:16,960
is this is something you could order on the computer and have sent to your home in six packs,

136
0:14:16,960 --> 0:14:24,240
10 packs, 1,000 packs, actually. But they are now coming to a pharmacy near you. They do not

137
0:14:24,240 --> 0:14:31,760
require physician access. They are not lick a sticks. These are lateral flow antigen tests. They

138
0:14:31,760 --> 0:14:38,560
involve you swabbing the front of your nose with one of these little Q-tips and then sticking it

139
0:14:38,560 --> 0:14:45,440
into this prepared card and waiting about 15 minutes. There's a little sort of bar scan code

140
0:14:45,440 --> 0:14:51,280
there that you use your phone to scan in your computer. And these actually started shipping

141
0:14:51,280 --> 0:14:59,200
to the major pharmacy chains on April 19. So really going to improve people's access to testing.

142
0:14:59,200 --> 0:15:05,120
It's still not at the price point that we would all like. We would like the test to be cheaper.

143
0:15:05,920 --> 0:15:10,960
People have actually gotten pretty comfortable with the nose swab. So I'm not too concerned that

144
0:15:10,960 --> 0:15:15,760
it needed to switch over to a lick a stick, but we would like it to be less expensive. Because if

145
0:15:15,760 --> 0:15:18,960
you think about this, this is going to be an equity issue again. You know, for some people,

146
0:15:18,960 --> 0:15:28,080
$25 to get a test is no big deal. For many of us, $25 a test starts to add up. If it isn't already

147
0:15:28,080 --> 0:15:34,480
a barrier, just right off the bat. Active vaccination. Here we are. Never miss an opportunity to vaccinate.

148
0:15:34,480 --> 0:15:41,680
Never waste a vaccine dose. In the US, we have now shifted from arms searching for vaccines to

149
0:15:41,680 --> 0:15:49,200
vaccines searching for arms. We are approaching in some parts of the country that time where

150
0:15:49,200 --> 0:15:57,360
really vaccine hesitancy is going to be the next great hurdle. Here in New York, we saw executive

151
0:15:57,360 --> 0:16:06,320
order 202.102. Now, what is that all about? Effective April 19th, as per this executive order,

152
0:16:07,280 --> 0:16:14,480
they eliminated the $100,000 civil penalty for failure of a provider to administer their

153
0:16:14,480 --> 0:16:20,320
allocated COVID-19 vaccine within seven days of receipt. I don't know if people are aware of this,

154
0:16:20,320 --> 0:16:28,800
but here in New York, if I as a provider were to accept 100 200 vaccines, I had seven days to

155
0:16:28,800 --> 0:16:34,800
get those into arms. If I did not report and get those into arms within seven days, I could face

156
0:16:34,800 --> 0:16:41,600
up to a $100,000 civil penalty. You know, I mixed feelings about this. One is it's kind of nice

157
0:16:41,600 --> 0:16:47,200
not to have that hanging over my head. But I am hoping those vaccines don't end up just sitting

158
0:16:47,200 --> 0:16:53,920
in refrigerators. I will point out, Moderna, when it arrives, you pop it in the refrigerator. It

159
0:16:53,920 --> 0:17:00,160
can stay there for 30 days. It shouldn't. Pfizer comes in those thermal shippers, which you can

160
0:17:00,160 --> 0:17:05,920
reload every five to seven days with dry ice. Once you take them out, they can actually sit in

161
0:17:05,920 --> 0:17:11,600
the refrigerator for up to five days. We're hoping that extends a little. They're just waiting to

162
0:17:11,600 --> 0:17:18,320
get approval. But okay. We're not at J&J yet. Stay tuned. We did get an update on the impact of

163
0:17:18,320 --> 0:17:26,160
vaccinations in the long-term care facility settings from the CDC, MMWR. Post vaccination

164
0:17:26,160 --> 0:17:32,160
SARS-CoV-2 infections among skilled nursing facility residents and staff member Chicago,

165
0:17:32,160 --> 0:17:41,920
Illinois, December 2020 through March 2021. And the authors reported here on 7,931

166
0:17:42,880 --> 0:17:50,240
skilled nursing facility residents and 6,834 staff members that had received two doses of

167
0:17:50,240 --> 0:17:58,080
COVID-19 vaccination in 75 Chicago-based skilled nursing facilities. In this group,

168
0:17:58,080 --> 0:18:04,800
they reported, I'm going to use the word only 22 possible breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infections

169
0:18:04,800 --> 0:18:11,360
among the fully vaccinated persons greater than 14 days after their second dose of COVID-19

170
0:18:11,360 --> 0:18:20,800
vaccinations. Two-thirds of these 22 were asymptomatic. A minority of persons with breakthrough

171
0:18:20,800 --> 0:18:29,040
infections experienced mild to moderate COVID-19 symptoms. Two of the 22 required hospitalization

172
0:18:29,040 --> 0:18:33,760
and one death that occur. There were no facility associated secondary transmissions

173
0:18:34,640 --> 0:18:42,640
in this study. So I think this is really encouraging seeing such thousands of people being vaccinated

174
0:18:42,640 --> 0:18:49,120
and seeing such a small number. But it does, as I like to point out, you are not bullet proof.

175
0:18:49,120 --> 0:18:54,640
There were two of these individuals that required hospitalization. One person did die from COVID-19.

176
0:18:54,640 --> 0:19:00,800
We also had an update on mRNA vaccine safety in pregnant women. This is huge. We can now say

177
0:19:00,800 --> 0:19:06,000
that, yes, these vaccines have been studied in pregnant women. In the New England Journal of

178
0:19:06,000 --> 0:19:14,080
Medicine on 4 slash 21, we saw the article preliminary findings of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine safety in

179
0:19:14,080 --> 0:19:24,160
pregnant persons. And the authors reported on 35,691 v-safe participants. 16 to 54 years of age

180
0:19:24,160 --> 0:19:30,160
identified as pregnant and found no safety signal. So I think this is really critical.

181
0:19:30,160 --> 0:19:36,400
We're looking now at over 35,000. So this is the same number of total participants in the early

182
0:19:36,400 --> 0:19:43,520
trials. We are not seeing safety signals. And this adds on to the data that a person who is vaccinated

183
0:19:43,520 --> 0:19:51,440
during pregnancy can pass on protection to their, at this point, unborn and later born child. So

184
0:19:52,080 --> 0:19:58,160
I think that that's going to help back to the J&J controversy. A couple of things I have to say

185
0:19:58,160 --> 0:20:06,560
here. There was an Axios Ipsos poll. And they reported that over 90% of the public is aware of

186
0:20:06,560 --> 0:20:14,320
the pause. They reported that the 91% awareness level is considered on par with or even a cut above

187
0:20:14,320 --> 0:20:19,920
awareness of who won the Super Bowl. I tested this this morning in the ICU and we all got it wrong.

188
0:20:19,920 --> 0:20:24,480
We knew it wasn't the Patriots. One person thought it was the Chiefs. I actually don't know if that's

189
0:20:24,480 --> 0:20:33,440
true. But I will say they also reported that about 88% of the people that said they were aware of

190
0:20:33,440 --> 0:20:39,520
this actually felt that the CDC and FDA were doing the responsible thing. Now, when this episode

191
0:20:39,520 --> 0:20:46,240
becomes available, the emergency meeting of ACIP will take in place. We're recording this on

192
0:20:46,240 --> 0:20:51,360
Thursday night. So that's hopefully going to happen Friday. And then this will drop Saturday.

193
0:20:52,000 --> 0:20:57,120
Not as early in the morning as it used to, but I understand that. And we will hear what they

194
0:20:57,120 --> 0:21:01,600
have to say. And so I won't weigh in. I mean, I guess I'll sort of guess on what they're saying.

195
0:21:01,600 --> 0:21:07,280
The the hope is that they're going to allow us to continue to use this vaccine that there will

196
0:21:07,280 --> 0:21:12,960
be a warning. So people are aware of what the what the risks are. Should they choose this as an

197
0:21:12,960 --> 0:21:19,280
option versus the other vaccines. We're hoping, I'd say as providers, that there isn't any kind

198
0:21:19,280 --> 0:21:24,000
of restriction that is forced on us, that this is something that we allow patients and providers to

199
0:21:24,000 --> 0:21:29,840
have a dialogue about. I bring up my daughter Daisy Griffin who's been tweeting about this

200
0:21:29,840 --> 0:21:34,400
and sort of putting out relative risks of other things. I mean, some of her comments,

201
0:21:35,120 --> 0:21:39,680
you know, daddy, if I have if I are one of my friends have to drive like an extra hour to get

202
0:21:39,680 --> 0:21:45,760
one of these other vaccines, I'm not sure that the risk of the vaccine is, you know, really a

203
0:21:45,760 --> 0:21:51,280
great thing relative to the risk of us being in a car, you know, an hour each way, half an hour each

204
0:21:51,280 --> 0:21:57,280
way. So we are hoping that we continue to have access because yes, I did say last time that we

205
0:21:57,280 --> 0:22:03,040
still have plenty of vaccines. But not all the vaccines are used in the same way. When we had the

206
0:22:03,040 --> 0:22:08,240
J&J shutdown, instead of people being vaccinated on their way out of the hospitals here in the

207
0:22:08,240 --> 0:22:14,560
New York area, they were basically given a piece of paper with an email address to try to arrange

208
0:22:14,560 --> 0:22:21,040
their vaccination. We also were using this, you know, kitchen workers people in harder to reach

209
0:22:21,040 --> 0:22:26,720
populations who really had trouble coming for two sessions. So there's an equity challenge here.

210
0:22:26,720 --> 0:22:33,520
So we'll see what happens. The Europe, Europe's health regulator, the European Medicines Agency,

211
0:22:33,520 --> 0:22:41,520
the EMA on Tuesday, April 20 recommended adding a warning about rare blood clots with low blood

212
0:22:41,520 --> 0:22:47,200
platelet counts to the vaccines product label for J&J and said that they felt the benefits of the

213
0:22:47,200 --> 0:22:54,560
one-dose shot outweighed its risk. So we'll see what happens here in the US. All right, the incubation

214
0:22:54,560 --> 0:23:00,320
period, the post exposure, you've been exposed. Remember, tests do not predict the future. There

215
0:23:00,320 --> 0:23:06,800
is a two to 14-day incubation period, but they can help us detect infection prior to contagion.

216
0:23:06,800 --> 0:23:12,480
So now that we have more testing, you know, once someone has been exposed, you know, if they're

217
0:23:12,480 --> 0:23:19,440
doing a $25 test every day, you can quickly detect before they spread to other people. So I think

218
0:23:19,440 --> 0:23:25,040
cheaper, better access to tests are going to really help us. So do not stop testing. Never miss

219
0:23:25,040 --> 0:23:30,880
an opportunity to test. We've got to keep doing that. Now, what about the period of detectable viral

220
0:23:30,880 --> 0:23:36,080
replication? So now you're starting to have symptoms. It's that first week. I like to say this is the

221
0:23:36,080 --> 0:23:44,480
time for monitoring and monoclonals. So we actually got some interesting evidence here on passive

222
0:23:44,480 --> 0:23:51,040
vaccination. There was what I think was a very nice article. The article was entitled Real-World

223
0:23:51,040 --> 0:23:58,320
Experience of BAM, one of a map for COVID-19, a case control study. This was accepted for

224
0:23:58,320 --> 0:24:03,920
publication in the Journal of Clinical Infectious Diseases. And the authors actually reached out

225
0:24:03,920 --> 0:24:07,120
to them earlier today. So hopefully they're going to be a little more information. I had

226
0:24:07,120 --> 0:24:12,960
questions, but they conducted a retrospective case control study across a single healthcare

227
0:24:12,960 --> 0:24:20,080
system of non-hospitalized patients, aged 18 years or older, with documented positive SARS-CoV-2

228
0:24:20,080 --> 0:24:26,720
testing, risk factors for severe COVID-19, and referrals for BAM-linevamav, the emergency use

229
0:24:26,720 --> 0:24:32,080
authorization, right? So this is back when we were doing just BAM-BAM before we had shifted to the

230
0:24:32,080 --> 0:24:41,680
monoclonals. They looked between November 20 and 2020 and January 19, 2021, at 218 patients that

231
0:24:41,680 --> 0:24:48,560
received BAM-linevamav, and 185 who were referred, but some things in the way, and they ended up not

232
0:24:48,560 --> 0:24:54,080
getting drugs. So these were the controls in this study. The 30-day hospitalization rate was

233
0:24:54,080 --> 0:25:04,240
significantly lower among patients who received BAM-linevamav, 7.3%, versus 20%, relative risk 0.37,

234
0:25:04,240 --> 0:25:12,800
p-value here of 0.001. So this was a real world reduction of greater than 60% with a very simple,

235
0:25:12,800 --> 0:25:18,720
well tolerated treatment. If you dig down through this data, I think you may underestimate the impact,

236
0:25:20,000 --> 0:25:25,520
because if someone has more severe risk factors, there's a little bit more of a push to make sure

237
0:25:25,520 --> 0:25:31,120
they do go ahead and get that treatment. People at lower risk, so there may have been some impact

238
0:25:31,120 --> 0:25:35,840
there. But another thing that really caught my attention, the authors comment on something that

239
0:25:35,840 --> 0:25:41,840
they felt highlighted health inequities. They reported that they found white English-speaking

240
0:25:41,840 --> 0:25:48,160
patients were more likely to receive therapy. Even though the materials are available in Spanish,

241
0:25:48,160 --> 0:25:54,400
we are not doing a great job of making sure this therapy is out there. We've been moving,

242
0:25:54,400 --> 0:26:00,400
as mentioned, past just BAM-BAM. We're now using cocktails and looking at second-generation monoclonals

243
0:26:00,400 --> 0:26:06,800
and trials that are looking for EUA. I was actually on a call recently with Ben Wiegand,

244
0:26:07,520 --> 0:26:13,200
and across the country looking at when, it was early mid-March that we switched using cocktails

245
0:26:13,200 --> 0:26:20,160
across the country. I think we're feeling that that was an excellent decision, none too late,

246
0:26:21,040 --> 0:26:24,640
not too early, definitely. Now, I also was on another call with,

247
0:26:24,640 --> 0:26:32,960
well, I'll say, a member of the formerly called Operation Warp Speed. I feel like it's like

248
0:26:32,960 --> 0:26:38,800
Prince or something. They needed a new name before. But one can take this as a glass half

249
0:26:39,360 --> 0:26:48,480
full or empty, but over 400,000 monoclonal antibody treatments have been given to date when I was on

250
0:26:48,480 --> 0:26:55,200
this call, more are already purchased by the US government and waiting to be administered. A couple

251
0:26:55,200 --> 0:27:00,640
things here. That is small. I look at 400,000, and I say that's enough for about a week of people

252
0:27:00,640 --> 0:27:07,360
getting infected. The whole IV infusion approach is a barrier, so there are some ongoing studies

253
0:27:07,360 --> 0:27:13,520
looking at both subcutaneous and intramuscular injections. I think people can envision a world

254
0:27:13,520 --> 0:27:20,560
where one is diagnosed, whether this is an ER, an urgent care, a primary care office,

255
0:27:20,560 --> 0:27:26,000
immediately offered an injection right there at point of care with these really impressive

256
0:27:26,560 --> 0:27:33,120
efficacy points. The early inflammatory phase, so this is if you've gotten through that first

257
0:27:33,120 --> 0:27:39,040
week, you're entering into that second week. If the room air saturation, so your pulse ox gets

258
0:27:39,040 --> 0:27:47,760
below 94%. This is when we consider steroids, remdesivir, and a coagulation for hospitalized

259
0:27:47,760 --> 0:27:52,240
patients. And I wasn't sure where to put this paper, but I thought I would throw it in here.

260
0:27:52,240 --> 0:27:56,960
There was an interesting, and I will say concerning, paper out of Columbia University,

261
0:27:56,960 --> 0:28:04,720
published in brain, and it was COVID-19 neuropathology at Columbia University Irving Medical Center

262
0:28:04,720 --> 0:28:11,040
New York Presbyterian Hospital. And the authors presented the clinical, neuropathological,

263
0:28:11,040 --> 0:28:17,360
and molecular findings of 41 consecutive patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections who died

264
0:28:17,360 --> 0:28:23,440
and underwent autopsy in our medical center. So here's the first caveat, right? Remember,

265
0:28:23,440 --> 0:28:29,200
these people all died. So this may not be what is going on in every person with COVID's brain.

266
0:28:29,200 --> 0:28:36,800
And so neurological examinations were done of 20 to 30 areas of each brain. And they saw

267
0:28:36,800 --> 0:28:42,320
hypoxic ischemic changes. So these areas not getting enough oxygen, not getting enough blood

268
0:28:42,320 --> 0:28:49,200
supply. They saw this in all the brains. They saw large and small infarcts. So think of those as

269
0:28:49,200 --> 0:28:56,640
strokes. Many of these appeared hemorrhagic, so bleeding into the brain. They also saw activation

270
0:28:56,640 --> 0:29:05,440
of the microglial cells with microglial nodules and accompanied by neuronephagia, most prominently

271
0:29:05,440 --> 0:29:13,360
in the brainstem. neuronephagia. So that's our word for today. That's actually the microglial

272
0:29:13,360 --> 0:29:20,480
cells. So the immune cells in the brain are actually eating your neurons. So really a frightening

273
0:29:20,480 --> 0:29:27,120
thing to be happening here. They reported that they saw only sparse T lymphocytes,

274
0:29:27,120 --> 0:29:33,600
so T cells in either perivascular regions or in the brain parencoma. And many of the

275
0:29:33,600 --> 0:29:39,760
brainses would be expected contained atherosclerosis, so hardening of the arteries of the large arteries,

276
0:29:39,760 --> 0:29:45,920
arterial sclerosis. But none had any evidence of vasculitis, so inflammation of the blood vessels.

277
0:29:45,920 --> 0:29:52,800
Now they went on, they examined multiple fresh, frozen, and fixed tissues from 28 brains for

278
0:29:52,800 --> 0:29:59,280
the presence of viral RNA and protein using a whole bunch of techniques. And anybody's directed

279
0:29:59,280 --> 0:30:07,680
against the spike in nucleocapsid regions of SARS-CoV-2. The PCR revealed low, very low,

280
0:30:07,680 --> 0:30:12,480
but detectable viral RNA levels in the majority of the brains. And they performed something called

281
0:30:12,480 --> 0:30:19,120
RNA scope, which is like an in situ hybridization technique looking, an amino histochemistry. And

282
0:30:19,120 --> 0:30:27,520
this all failed to detect viral RNA or protein in the brains. Maybe people listen to TWIV 746,

283
0:30:27,520 --> 0:30:32,000
where there was a whole discussion about how a virus can sometimes get into the brain or not.

284
0:30:33,120 --> 0:30:37,200
And these authors concluded that these findings suggested that it was really

285
0:30:37,200 --> 0:30:41,040
not virus getting into the brain. It was really microglial activation,

286
0:30:41,040 --> 0:30:47,120
these microglial nodules, this neuronal phagia, these immune cells eating nerves,

287
0:30:48,400 --> 0:30:53,520
that was really causing what was going on and not direct viral infection of the brain

288
0:30:54,240 --> 0:31:00,160
parenchyma. And there also was probably a synergistic contribution from the hypoxia

289
0:31:00,160 --> 0:31:07,040
and the ischemia. Now we're going to move on to the tail phase long COVID. So we had a long

290
0:31:07,040 --> 0:31:12,880
episode last week. So I saved this one for now. Is it a bit of good news to end on? Let's see. So

291
0:31:12,880 --> 0:31:19,440
in the JAMA network, open the article, mortality among US patients hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2

292
0:31:19,440 --> 0:31:25,360
infection in 2020 was published. This was a retrospective cohort study, including patients

293
0:31:25,360 --> 0:31:31,920
who were hospitalized for at least one day at one of over 200 US acute care hospitals

294
0:31:31,920 --> 0:31:42,480
between March 1 and November 21, 2020. And they reported on 503,409 admitted patients

295
0:31:42,480 --> 0:31:48,560
and found that in-hospital mortality declined across all age groups during the period evaluated.

296
0:31:48,560 --> 0:31:55,200
Overall, in-hospital mortality peaked in April of 2020. I think we can remember that horrible

297
0:31:55,200 --> 0:32:02,720
month where the in-hospital mortality was 19.7 and then decreased significantly to November,

298
0:32:03,440 --> 0:32:11,280
where it was down to 9.3%, still unacceptably high. Really nice article. Go ahead and I'm going to

299
0:32:11,280 --> 0:32:16,560
actually say, once you finish this or you're driving or in stop, look at this article. They

300
0:32:16,560 --> 0:32:21,120
have a really beautiful figure where they show that this trend was apparent for all age groups.

301
0:32:21,120 --> 0:32:27,920
The older you were, the higher the mortality, thus the greater the decrease. But this was apparent

302
0:32:27,920 --> 0:32:34,240
across all age groups. So we are doing better at all ages. The mortality that we're seeing is lower

303
0:32:34,240 --> 0:32:40,480
in hospital. And this is reflected in part because we have younger people. But it also is that we

304
0:32:40,480 --> 0:32:46,640
are getting better at taking care of these people. At an individual age adjusted, we are decreasing

305
0:32:46,640 --> 0:32:53,040
the mortality. So I'm going to end on that note before we go to emails. We are nearing the end

306
0:32:53,040 --> 0:32:58,480
of our fundraiser. Donations made to parasites without borders. Go to parasiteswithoutborders.com.

307
0:32:59,360 --> 0:33:04,160
We are going to contribute to the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene. They

308
0:33:04,160 --> 0:33:09,920
left out hygiene last time. And we never want to leave out hygiene. We are going to, and I think

309
0:33:09,920 --> 0:33:17,200
we're going to get there to give them $40,000 to support three travel awards, helping women,

310
0:33:17,840 --> 0:33:25,120
qualified early career investigators working in tropical medicine to attend the annual meeting.

311
0:33:25,680 --> 0:33:31,840
So help us support these. It's actually women, low income countries coming to this meeting and

312
0:33:31,840 --> 0:33:37,680
help do what we can to address some of the inequities. Time for a few emails for Daniel.

313
0:33:37,680 --> 0:33:44,640
If you'd like to send one, send it to Daniel at microbe.tv. First is from Avital, who is a single

314
0:33:44,640 --> 0:33:50,080
mom with a seven year old daughter, just got her second shot of Moderna. She sends a picture

315
0:33:50,720 --> 0:33:56,400
of getting the shot with her twiv t-shirt. So that's becoming a thing. People are sending us

316
0:33:56,400 --> 0:34:01,920
their photos with their twiv t-shirts. Wonderful. Love it. In a couple of weeks, she writes,

317
0:34:01,920 --> 0:34:06,480
when I'm fully vaccinated, we're going to go fly back home to Montana. My daughter will go to camp.

318
0:34:06,480 --> 0:34:13,360
The camp is doing all the right things, wearing N95 masks, face shields on the plane. The summer

319
0:34:13,360 --> 0:34:18,320
camp is outdoors with COVID precautions. However, I know her risk of exposure will be increased.

320
0:34:18,880 --> 0:34:23,200
In the case of an infection in the child, what would you suggest as far as a course of treatment

321
0:34:23,200 --> 0:34:27,840
to try and avoid the inflammatory syndrome, which sometimes occurs? Also, do you have any general

322
0:34:27,840 --> 0:34:33,680
guidance for vaccinated parents with unvaccinated children? All right. So there's a lot there.

323
0:34:33,680 --> 0:34:41,200
I think you hit several points. I like the fact that you're aware in the KN95s on the airplanes,

324
0:34:41,200 --> 0:34:49,520
in the airports. And I think we try to point out, as per the CDC, there's a respiratory droplet

325
0:34:49,520 --> 0:34:54,400
component of transmission. There also can be an airborne component of transmission, particularly

326
0:34:54,400 --> 0:34:59,600
when you're in these crowded indoor spaces, and you're not aware of how good the ventilation is

327
0:34:59,600 --> 0:35:07,840
going to be. If a child gets COVID-19 that first week, one of the interesting things,

328
0:35:07,840 --> 0:35:12,240
this has come up with several times, would they benefit? Would we reduce the risk of them getting

329
0:35:12,960 --> 0:35:20,480
MISC-C or MISC-C? Is there anything we can do to prevent them to lower that risk? It is a low

330
0:35:20,480 --> 0:35:26,720
risk. I do want to point that out. But we don't have a lot of great recommendations or proven

331
0:35:26,720 --> 0:35:31,440
therapies that we can do during that first week. Just like an adult, if they move into that second

332
0:35:31,440 --> 0:35:38,000
week and start having low oxygen saturations, then we extrapolate. And a lot of clinicians would

333
0:35:38,000 --> 0:35:44,000
actually consider a sort of weight-based adjusted dose of steroids, oxygen support. And if they

334
0:35:44,000 --> 0:35:48,000
get into week four, unfortunately, I'm not going to say that we have any great evidence that we

335
0:35:48,000 --> 0:35:52,880
can prevent that. Part of that is the low risk relative to the risk of us doing anything,

336
0:35:52,880 --> 0:35:59,520
then there have been treatments that are suggested. The camp, it sounds great that they're doing all

337
0:35:59,520 --> 0:36:03,680
the right things. I was doing an interview recently where I talked about how do you know that the

338
0:36:03,680 --> 0:36:10,480
camp is doing the right thing? Testing, right? There is now testing that is being paid for, provided,

339
0:36:10,480 --> 0:36:15,680
for by the government. So if your child is going to a camp and they have a testing program ahead

340
0:36:15,680 --> 0:36:20,960
of time to make sure kids don't show up with the virus, and then they have testing programs in

341
0:36:20,960 --> 0:36:27,520
place once they arrive. I think of that as a marker. These are tests that the camp does not

342
0:36:27,520 --> 0:36:32,560
have to pay for. Our tax dollars have already paid for these. If the camp is taking advantage

343
0:36:32,560 --> 0:36:36,880
of that program, I think it shows that they're being proactive taking this seriously. And that's

344
0:36:36,880 --> 0:36:41,760
probably the best thing you can do for your child. What is the best way to make sure a child does

345
0:36:41,760 --> 0:36:46,560
not have issues with COVID is to make sure they don't get infected with COVID. And that should

346
0:36:46,560 --> 0:36:51,840
be a way of keeping them safe. Avital points out that she's heard rumblings of a Pfizer pediatric

347
0:36:51,840 --> 0:36:58,000
trial being set up in Pittsburgh where she lives. And she's hoping to enroll her daughter in that

348
0:36:58,000 --> 0:37:06,240
trial. Our next one is from Gordon. Thanks for the good discussion on the use of masks. I'm puzzled

349
0:37:06,240 --> 0:37:10,880
by the reluctance of authorities, including yourself to recommend the use of N95 respirators.

350
0:37:10,880 --> 0:37:14,960
If you're trying to protect yourself against a potentially fatal infection, wouldn't it make

351
0:37:14,960 --> 0:37:20,400
sense to use the highest level of reasonably obtainable protection? I know N95 respirators

352
0:37:20,400 --> 0:37:25,040
were in short supply in 2020. But I think that's no longer an issue. You can certainly buy them on

353
0:37:25,040 --> 0:37:32,560
eBay here in La Paz, Mexico. I can purchase a Chinese KN 95 at any pharmacy for $2. The ones I use

354
0:37:32,560 --> 0:37:38,400
appear to be well made with the same materials you would find in a 3M N95. Is it that old bugaboo?

355
0:37:38,400 --> 0:37:42,960
We don't have the data to show they are needed or better. Personally, I'm not relying on a cloth

356
0:37:42,960 --> 0:37:48,480
face mask that meets no mandated quality control or performance standards to protect me. But then

357
0:37:48,480 --> 0:37:55,360
what do I know? I'm just a retired health and safety professional. Yes, just a retired health

358
0:37:55,360 --> 0:37:59,680
and safety professional. No, I think you're I think you're on point with this. The data is

359
0:37:59,680 --> 0:38:06,240
out there. We have a lot of evidence about different masks and their impact upon your safety.

360
0:38:07,520 --> 0:38:12,880
If you told me, Oh, I'm a person who's immunosuppressed. I'm 92 years old. I'm planning on going to

361
0:38:12,880 --> 0:38:17,920
a big indoor gathering. Yeah, I would want you wearing an N95 mask. I don't see a problem with

362
0:38:17,920 --> 0:38:24,640
recommending that at all. If we're talking about physicians working in a setting where we have

363
0:38:24,640 --> 0:38:30,960
good air exchange, if you're going to be outdoors able to distance yourself, then I'm not sure you

364
0:38:30,960 --> 0:38:36,960
need to wear the N95. But as I think I mentioned, the woman traveling on an airplane when my wife

365
0:38:36,960 --> 0:38:44,080
and daughter is actually Eloise. I think this time we're on an airplane at one point. I actually,

366
0:38:44,080 --> 0:38:49,840
I advise them and they went ahead and listened to me crazy as that sounds. And they were a Ken and

367
0:38:49,840 --> 0:38:57,600
K N95 the whole time that they were in transit. Once they got to the other side and were outdoors

368
0:38:57,600 --> 0:39:03,200
off came the mask. My son Barnaby tells me that his mile time is impacted negatively when I have

369
0:39:03,200 --> 0:39:10,080
them wear a K N95 on the cross country course on the track. But now I think that the data is out

370
0:39:10,080 --> 0:39:16,560
here. The N95 does offer more protection. And I think as we talk today, if you're going to wear

371
0:39:16,560 --> 0:39:20,880
one of these surgical masks, it looks like if you throw a cloth mask over it, you can increase

372
0:39:20,880 --> 0:39:26,800
your protection as well. So we're still in the middle of a pandemic. There are areas in our world

373
0:39:26,800 --> 0:39:31,520
and even here in this country where the rates are unacceptably high and the risks are unacceptably

374
0:39:31,520 --> 0:39:37,120
high. So I think the science is out there to say that there are more effective masks that can

375
0:39:37,120 --> 0:39:42,640
decrease that risk. And Teresa writes, I'm a nurse working in Canada. I was not given the Pfizer

376
0:39:42,640 --> 0:39:48,000
vaccine because I had an anaphylactic reaction to depot lidocaine injection for frozen shoulder,

377
0:39:48,560 --> 0:39:53,600
which does contain PEG polyethylene glycol doctors felt it could be a preservative that caused the

378
0:39:53,600 --> 0:40:00,320
reaction. I was then given the AstraZeneca vaccine and now fall into that category of 55 and under

379
0:40:00,320 --> 0:40:05,040
questionable about getting the second dose. What can be done for someone like me? Do you feel

380
0:40:05,040 --> 0:40:09,360
there will be a change in the Pfizer vaccine and removing this ingredient? Now I'm worried I

381
0:40:09,360 --> 0:40:15,280
won't be able to get any other vaccine. Any ideas? Yeah. So this is this is an excellent question.

382
0:40:15,280 --> 0:40:21,840
And I think hits that really sort of practical advice here. When they've looked at the AstraZeneca,

383
0:40:21,840 --> 0:40:27,280
the people who are having their reactions are having them after the first dose. We're not seeing

384
0:40:27,280 --> 0:40:30,880
that then they go ahead and have them after the second dose if they tolerated the first one.

385
0:40:31,440 --> 0:40:36,240
So the current recommendations are that if you tolerated the first AstraZeneca dose,

386
0:40:36,880 --> 0:40:40,480
it is fine to proceed with the second AstraZeneca dose. I'll say that.

387
0:40:41,920 --> 0:40:48,480
You can't really take the PEG 2000 out of the Pfizer or the Moderna. It's actually part of that

388
0:40:48,480 --> 0:40:56,080
liposomal packaging. So it's not a preservative in that setting. So if you had an issue with

389
0:40:56,080 --> 0:41:02,880
the Pfizer, with the Moderna, I think it's reasonable to look at the adenovirus vector vaccines,

390
0:41:03,840 --> 0:41:10,960
completing your AstraZeneca here, J&J for individuals in other settings. And I think we're

391
0:41:10,960 --> 0:41:16,720
hoping fingers crossed that we're going to hear about Novavax coming out as well. That's our pure

392
0:41:16,720 --> 0:41:23,520
protein, sort of our Shingrix technology being applied now to COVID that we're thinking maybe

393
0:41:23,520 --> 0:41:29,040
another option for people that have had issues with other vaccines. So looking forward to not

394
0:41:29,040 --> 0:41:36,720
only more and more vaccines in the world, not just here in the US, but also looking at vaccines

395
0:41:36,720 --> 0:41:42,080
that have different safety profiles may allow people to have a little more selection. And I see

396
0:41:42,080 --> 0:41:47,120
that as positive for several things. One is that if people have the ability to have a choice,

397
0:41:47,120 --> 0:41:51,360
if they have that agency, I think it helps a lot. It helps with vaccine hesitancy. People

398
0:41:51,360 --> 0:41:55,840
who want to be told this is what you got when you sign up, you get what we tell you. People like

399
0:41:55,840 --> 0:42:01,120
to have some involvement in decision making. So I think that's really positive. And I will say,

400
0:42:01,120 --> 0:42:06,880
boy, we may have too many vaccines here in the US. We may have a glut. I liked an analogy I heard

401
0:42:06,880 --> 0:42:11,120
that, yeah, it's fine to put that oxygen mask on yourself first before you help everyone else.

402
0:42:12,000 --> 0:42:16,800
But don't leave for oxygen mask sitting in your lap. Let's get those oxygen masks on everyone as

403
0:42:16,800 --> 0:42:23,440
well. That is COVID-19 clinical update number 59 with Dr. Daniel Griffin. Thanks again, Daniel.

404
0:42:23,440 --> 0:42:53,280
All right. Thank you so much. And everyone, be safe.
