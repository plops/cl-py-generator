0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:06,880
This week in virology, the podcast about viruses, the kind that make you sick.

2
0:00:10,480 --> 0:00:20,480
From MicrobeTV, this is Twiv, this week in virology. Episode 783, recorded on June 22, 2021.

3
0:00:21,120 --> 0:00:27,040
I'm Vincent Rackeniello, and you're listening to the podcast all about viruses. Joining me

4
0:00:27,040 --> 0:00:30,960
today from New York, Daniel Griffin. Hello, everyone.

5
0:00:32,080 --> 0:00:39,280
Daniel, I noticed that the U.S. vaccination is just approaching 50% for fully vaccinated.

6
0:00:39,280 --> 0:00:45,120
That doesn't seem like a lot, does it? No, no. That was my Anthony Fauci, you know, where I

7
0:00:47,120 --> 0:00:54,800
put my hand up and shake my head. So listening to another podcast the other day,

8
0:00:54,800 --> 0:01:02,000
it's one that Andy Slavitt does. And he was interviewing somebody from Facebook,

9
0:01:02,560 --> 0:01:06,640
and they were talking about the fact that 65% of the

10
0:01:07,440 --> 0:01:14,000
miss and disinformation regarding vaccines comes from 12 individuals, 12 individuals.

11
0:01:14,000 --> 0:01:17,760
And they just pump the stuff out, you know, and they get banned from Twitter, but then they're

12
0:01:17,760 --> 0:01:27,120
still on Facebook. And yeah, I mean, you know, this active disinformation is killing people.

13
0:01:27,760 --> 0:01:32,880
And, you know, I was on a call with a United Health Group, sort of the Optum, one of the

14
0:01:32,880 --> 0:01:37,360
higher groups. And there was a lot of pessimism about, you know, the people that aren't going to

15
0:01:37,360 --> 0:01:41,520
get vaccinated, just not going to get vaccinated. I don't think that's true. I mean, these individuals

16
0:01:41,520 --> 0:01:48,240
are still spending an incredible amount of time, millions of dollars to introduce fear,

17
0:01:48,240 --> 0:01:53,920
to just make stuff up about the vaccines. And one of the comments, I think it was a Kaiser

18
0:01:53,920 --> 0:01:58,640
survey where they asked people. And four out of five people who are not vaccinated

19
0:01:58,640 --> 0:02:02,320
believe something about the vaccine. That's not true. They were told something, they were

20
0:02:02,320 --> 0:02:08,880
misinformed. So yeah, we really have to make a difference here. And a lot of it, you know,

21
0:02:08,880 --> 0:02:12,000
how do you get someone who's not vaccinated to get vaccinated? Number one is you listen,

22
0:02:12,640 --> 0:02:16,400
you stop, you take a deep breath, you listen, what are your concerns? You don't ridicule them.

23
0:02:17,040 --> 0:02:22,320
And a lot of times they've been told something by someone, and it's just not true. And I think

24
0:02:22,320 --> 0:02:26,880
we need to have patients, we need to have humility, we need to reach out to these individuals.

25
0:02:27,680 --> 0:02:34,000
Because I think that if they actually knew the facts, a large number of people would come to the

26
0:02:34,000 --> 0:02:39,760
conclusion that it's not so important to be part of a tribe that you're going to put the lives of

27
0:02:39,760 --> 0:02:47,360
yourself and your loved ones at risk by choosing to get COVID, as opposed to choosing a much safer

28
0:02:47,360 --> 0:02:55,360
option, which is the vaccines. What is the motivation of these 12 individuals who spread

29
0:02:55,360 --> 0:03:02,880
misinformation? You know, I'm speculating, of course, we do know that there's a big sort of

30
0:03:02,880 --> 0:03:09,600
financial incentive. There's a lot of power that comes along with, you know, stirring up the masses.

31
0:03:10,240 --> 0:03:13,760
I think it was disturbing to find out, right, what happened in France where scientists were

32
0:03:13,760 --> 0:03:21,840
actually taking money to sign letters. It's really, you know, at some point you can't have a price,

33
0:03:21,840 --> 0:03:27,760
your price has to be truth and honesty. And I think these individuals need to look in the mirror and

34
0:03:27,760 --> 0:03:34,160
ask, like, is that is that blood money worth it? Are you willing to take this money? Because this is

35
0:03:34,160 --> 0:03:43,440
not honest scientific discussion. This is pure blatant misinformation. It's just wrong.

36
0:03:44,480 --> 0:03:46,240
Okay. All right.

37
0:03:50,480 --> 0:03:54,800
I don't know if that's I don't think that's political. I feel like that's just honesty.

38
0:03:54,800 --> 0:03:59,680
But anyway, so let's let's start off with two quotes from a rather impressive woman.

39
0:04:00,640 --> 0:04:04,080
And I'm going to give the quotes, then we'll be like our four second pause while people

40
0:04:04,080 --> 0:04:10,800
see if they can remember who who said these things. The work of today is the history of tomorrow

41
0:04:10,800 --> 0:04:18,000
and we are its makers. And the second quotation to be inspired is great, but to be an inspiration

42
0:04:18,000 --> 0:04:24,720
is an honor. Juliet Gordon Lowe. I am impressed. You don't even have daughters.

43
0:04:27,440 --> 0:04:32,000
So yes, that was Juliet Gordon Lowe, the founder of the Girl Scouts of America.

44
0:04:32,000 --> 0:04:34,000
I do have a daughter. I do have a daughter.

45
0:04:34,000 --> 0:04:39,040
You do have a daughter? Yes. And she would, that's why I know.

46
0:04:39,040 --> 0:04:43,200
Did you see there was a pause there, everyone? It took me so in a moment to remember.

47
0:04:43,200 --> 0:04:50,800
Yeah, I just listened to you. I was like, wait a second. All right. So yes. Yeah.

48
0:04:50,800 --> 0:04:56,080
So Juliet Gordon Lowe was the founder of Girl Scouts of America, really a tremendous organization.

49
0:04:56,080 --> 0:05:02,160
So yeah, and really just a really inspiring woman. And you know, I don't know if people were aware,

50
0:05:02,160 --> 0:05:07,840
but the Girl Scouts of America actually did a get the vote out. And now I know there's discussions

51
0:05:07,840 --> 0:05:14,560
about get the vaccine out. Having Girl Scouts try to help with these efforts. I have two daughters.

52
0:05:15,600 --> 0:05:23,200
I know that right away without a pause. And they both actually went all the way through,

53
0:05:23,200 --> 0:05:30,720
became sort of these gold star at the end. They did their gold awards. And actually the last,

54
0:05:30,720 --> 0:05:36,480
actually Eloise's Gold Award was the service dog project and raising a service dog, doing the

55
0:05:36,480 --> 0:05:42,800
puppy rearing and then doing information sessions about it. So tremendous organization, tremendous

56
0:05:42,800 --> 0:05:47,680
woman. And I think right now when we look at these individuals that are not vaccinated,

57
0:05:47,680 --> 0:05:54,720
who is the most influential person? It's your friend. It's your family. So reach out to your

58
0:05:54,720 --> 0:05:59,520
friends and family. Reach out to people you care about. Have honest, respectful discussions about

59
0:05:59,520 --> 0:06:06,080
the vaccines. We can make a difference. We can get over this hump. Hundreds of people do not need

60
0:06:06,080 --> 0:06:10,720
to keep dying every day in the US. Thousands of people do not need to keep dying around the world

61
0:06:10,720 --> 0:06:17,920
every day. We have safe, incredibly effective vaccines. All right, so let me update on what's

62
0:06:17,920 --> 0:06:26,720
going on. As people know, the trends are not great. We went from a cruise ship of people dying

63
0:06:26,720 --> 0:06:31,360
per day in America down to a jumbo jet crashing every day as far as numbers of people dying.

64
0:06:31,360 --> 0:06:38,800
That's not great. And the numbers are going up. But I will say at least in our local area,

65
0:06:38,800 --> 0:06:45,360
when we are seeing vaccinated people get infected, it's mild. It's very rare for them to end up in

66
0:06:45,360 --> 0:06:50,800
the hospital. It's incredibly rare for them to die, right? We're going from a one in 30 chance of

67
0:06:50,800 --> 0:06:56,640
death in an unvaccinated to a one in a million. And we're going to talk a little bit about kids

68
0:06:56,640 --> 0:07:01,520
here in a moment. There's a lot of fear still in the media about this. The fear should be

69
0:07:02,240 --> 0:07:07,200
driving people to vaccination. But once you're vaccinated, that is a very good place to be.

70
0:07:08,160 --> 0:07:13,040
One of my friends and colleagues actually wrote a paper, maybe a couple papers in the last year,

71
0:07:13,040 --> 0:07:19,280
Denise Brennan Ryder, she's an Irish Canadian. She's also a mother. And she was sharing with me

72
0:07:19,280 --> 0:07:25,040
recently just some of the struggles that she's been going through as a mom with issues with

73
0:07:25,040 --> 0:07:32,320
access to vaccination and concerns that her children have. And I just, we need to sort of

74
0:07:32,320 --> 0:07:37,120
balance. And as I talk about kids, I always say kids are at low risk, but they're not at no risk.

75
0:07:37,120 --> 0:07:42,800
But there is a balance here with all the fear. The vaccines continue to work. Even when we hear

76
0:07:42,800 --> 0:07:49,120
about these new variants, they continue to be very effective at preventing serious disease,

77
0:07:49,120 --> 0:07:55,200
preventing hospitalization. We would love if they were 100% for our herd immunity aspect.

78
0:07:55,760 --> 0:08:00,640
But that's only a small part of the story. And that should be sort of balanced with all the

79
0:08:00,640 --> 0:08:06,080
fear that we see in the media. So just want to sort of start with that. But let's get right

80
0:08:06,080 --> 0:08:11,680
on to kids. And I'm going to talk about long COVID in kids, because I think this is part of

81
0:08:11,680 --> 0:08:19,040
the metric, part of the equation that people are not considering. And I actually had a gentleman

82
0:08:19,040 --> 0:08:25,280
email me directly earlier today. And I really sort of taken him back because his daughter's

83
0:08:25,280 --> 0:08:31,120
pediatrician, she's an eligible adolescent, the US pediatrician was not really in favor of

84
0:08:31,120 --> 0:08:37,360
vaccination and had not recommended vaccination. So I was a bit shocked. And I know sometimes

85
0:08:37,360 --> 0:08:43,120
people say, well, you know, only a few hundred children have died while we shut down everything.

86
0:08:43,120 --> 0:08:49,360
Only several thousand children ended up in the hospital. But what about kids that got COVID?

87
0:08:49,360 --> 0:08:54,880
How are they doing two, three months down the road? Is long COVID a significant issue in children?

88
0:08:54,880 --> 0:09:02,160
So we just saw the study, long-term symptoms after SARS-CoV-2 infection in children and adolescents

89
0:09:02,160 --> 0:09:07,120
published in JAMA, the Journal of the American Medical Association. And the authors addressed a

90
0:09:07,120 --> 0:09:13,040
significant issue that we really need to know about when we're looking at return to school this

91
0:09:13,040 --> 0:09:16,960
fall, right? We have a lot of people saying, eh, get the kids back in school. Not a big issue

92
0:09:16,960 --> 0:09:23,040
if kids get COVID. I don't want my kid wearing a mask or anyone else. Well, we know about deaths.

93
0:09:23,040 --> 0:09:31,120
We know about hospitalizations. What about long COVID? So this was a longitudinal cohort study

94
0:09:31,120 --> 0:09:40,080
investigating SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in 55 randomly selected schools in areas in Switzerland.

95
0:09:40,640 --> 0:09:47,040
And they chose a linguistically and ethnically diverse population of 1.5 million residents in

96
0:09:47,040 --> 0:09:53,040
both urban and rural settings. So we're getting a nice cross-section here. The investigators

97
0:09:53,040 --> 0:09:59,200
collected blood for serological analysis and then used questionnaires to assess the symptoms.

98
0:09:59,200 --> 0:10:06,880
They compared children who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 with those who tested negative during a

99
0:10:06,880 --> 0:10:15,200
period October, November 2020. Ultimately, over 1,355 children were included in the analysis.

100
0:10:15,760 --> 0:10:22,560
And what did they find? They found that the most frequently reported symptoms lasting more than

101
0:10:22,560 --> 0:10:30,560
12 weeks. I just want to repeat that. 12 weeks, right? So three months after these children had

102
0:10:30,560 --> 0:10:38,800
been infected with COVID, 3% of them were still reporting that significant fatigue. 2% were still

103
0:10:38,800 --> 0:10:45,360
reporting difficulty concentrating. Another 2% were reporting an increased need for sleep.

104
0:10:46,560 --> 0:10:50,560
Now, there are background rates. You know, we assess these symptoms. So just think about asking

105
0:10:50,560 --> 0:10:57,200
1,000 kids, you know, and there is sort of a background rate. But overall, what they were seeing

106
0:10:57,200 --> 0:11:04,640
is about 4% of the serology positive children were still having symptoms 3 months later. So that's

107
0:11:04,640 --> 0:11:13,680
1 in 25 kids who gets COVID is still having issues 3 months later, right? Symptoms consistent with

108
0:11:13,680 --> 0:11:18,720
long COVID. So I just I want people to think about this when you send kids back to school.

109
0:11:18,720 --> 0:11:25,200
So let's say you're your child. Let's say you have a daughter like Vincent now remembers and she goes

110
0:11:25,200 --> 0:11:31,120
to class. And you know, there's 25 kids in the class. And we say, oh, you know what, not a big deal.

111
0:11:31,120 --> 0:11:37,040
We'll just let them all get COVID. It's not a big deal. One of those 25 kids is still going to be

112
0:11:37,040 --> 0:11:44,800
sick 3 months later. I have to say as a parent that that's too high for me 1 in 25. So we look at

113
0:11:44,800 --> 0:11:50,800
the risks of vaccination. You know, we're talking about short lived myocardial cardiac inflammation

114
0:11:50,800 --> 0:11:56,160
maybe for a couple days that gets better with over the counter medicine rates of maybe 1 in 100,000

115
0:11:56,160 --> 0:12:03,360
1 in a million things like that versus 1 in 25 being sick for 3 months having problems going to

116
0:12:03,360 --> 0:12:08,400
school. So I think when people talk about the risks in children, you can't just look at deaths.

117
0:12:08,400 --> 0:12:13,520
You can't just look at hospitalizations. It's the same as adults. You've got to look at the whole

118
0:12:13,520 --> 0:12:20,320
picture. And when someone has long COVID, that's that's a disaster. That's a tragedy in my book.

119
0:12:22,160 --> 0:12:28,960
Now we did get some some good news in the realm of pediatrics. And this was what about those kids

120
0:12:28,960 --> 0:12:37,200
who had that multi-system inflammatory syndrome. So there was a publication in pediatrics. That's

121
0:12:37,200 --> 0:12:42,960
the official journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics. Longitudinal outcomes for multi-system

122
0:12:42,960 --> 0:12:49,920
inflammatory syndrome in children. And the authors reported on all of the 45 children that had been

123
0:12:49,920 --> 0:12:54,240
admitted to Columbia Presbyterian Hospital. It's like about a block or two from where

124
0:12:54,240 --> 0:13:02,080
Vincent is sitting right now. And they followed them actually out to four to nine months. And they

125
0:13:02,080 --> 0:13:07,440
found that basically about a month, a lot of the inflammatory markers were going down. When they

126
0:13:07,440 --> 0:13:14,320
got far out, only one child was still having persistent mild dysfunction. One had mild mitral

127
0:13:14,320 --> 0:13:19,920
and tricuspid regurgitation. But in general, the kids were getting better. So I think that is

128
0:13:20,480 --> 0:13:26,160
that's reassuring. We don't have longer term outcome. But the authors actually concluded

129
0:13:26,160 --> 0:13:32,560
the majority of children with Miss C. So that's multi-system inflammatory syndrome of children

130
0:13:32,560 --> 0:13:39,600
present critically ill. But most inflammatory and cardiac manifestations go on to resolve

131
0:13:39,600 --> 0:13:47,120
in a period of months. So rapidly. So that's nice to know. I know people have always asked

132
0:13:47,120 --> 0:13:54,720
what happened to these kids. Now, sticking with children here, the American Academy of Pediatrics

133
0:13:54,720 --> 0:14:02,320
came out with some recent guidance with a statement that got a bit oppressed. Some people

134
0:14:02,320 --> 0:14:07,680
are unhappy about it. So let me go through the high points of that statement because some people

135
0:14:07,680 --> 0:14:13,600
are asking how do we take this statement and mesh it with what we're hearing from the CDC

136
0:14:13,600 --> 0:14:19,440
as we're looking at school opening. So the first part is in line. American Academy of Pediatrics

137
0:14:19,440 --> 0:14:26,640
is saying all eligible individuals should receive the COVID-19 vaccine. So that pediatrician, I'm

138
0:14:26,640 --> 0:14:31,440
not sure what professional organization he gets his guidance from. But the American Academy of

139
0:14:31,440 --> 0:14:37,840
Pediatrics is recommending that we go ahead and vaccinate all the eligible information.

140
0:14:39,040 --> 0:14:45,280
The other is, and this is the thing that was controversial, all students older than two years

141
0:14:45,280 --> 0:14:51,360
and all school staff should wear face masks at school unless medical or developmental conditions

142
0:14:51,360 --> 0:14:57,680
prohibit use. Why? So they do. I think they knew that this would get some feedback. So they go

143
0:14:57,680 --> 0:15:04,960
ahead and they give us five reasons. So the AAP recommends universal masking in school at this

144
0:15:04,960 --> 0:15:10,240
time for the following five reasons. One, a significant portion of the student population

145
0:15:10,240 --> 0:15:17,200
is not eligible for vaccination. So I think that's something. Second, protection of unvaccinated

146
0:15:17,200 --> 0:15:24,000
students from COVID-19 and to reduce transmission. This is sort of coupled with the fact that we do

147
0:15:24,000 --> 0:15:29,040
not have a system to monitor the vaccine status among the students, the teachers and staff.

148
0:15:30,000 --> 0:15:35,360
And I think we've all had that experience. You know, you go into a supermarket in an area where maybe

149
0:15:35,360 --> 0:15:39,440
50% of the people are vaccinated, but no one's wearing a mask because people who are vaccinated

150
0:15:39,440 --> 0:15:44,560
don't need to wear a mask. Well, people who are unvaccinated have got the masks off too. So

151
0:15:44,560 --> 0:15:49,040
they're pointing that out. There's really no good system for knowing who's vaccinated

152
0:15:49,040 --> 0:15:57,520
and enforcing masks only for the vaccinated unvaccinated. Point three, potential and this ties right in

153
0:15:57,520 --> 0:16:02,800
potential difficulty in monitoring or enforcing mask policies for those who are not vaccinated.

154
0:16:04,560 --> 0:16:09,280
The ability of schools, and this is right in the same, to have consistent messaging,

155
0:16:09,280 --> 0:16:14,720
expectations, enforcement and compliance without needing to try to monitor vaccination status.

156
0:16:14,720 --> 0:16:21,600
Four, and this is sort of relates to the community, right? The biggest risk for a child is what's

157
0:16:21,600 --> 0:16:26,320
going on in the community around the school. Schools are often safer than the environment

158
0:16:26,320 --> 0:16:33,200
around. And so the AAP says the possibility of low vaccination uptake within the surrounding

159
0:16:33,200 --> 0:16:39,360
school community. And then finally five, and this we'll be touching on as we go further,

160
0:16:39,360 --> 0:16:44,800
continued concerns for variants that are more easily spread among children, adolescents and

161
0:16:44,800 --> 0:16:50,720
adults. So they've got their recommendation for face masks at school, and they've got their

162
0:16:50,720 --> 0:16:59,760
explanation for why they're saying that. All right, now pre-exposer testing, right? So testing

163
0:16:59,760 --> 0:17:04,240
never miss an opportunity to test. Now I know when I talked about some of the other guidance,

164
0:17:04,240 --> 0:17:11,120
part of the school reopening guidance is having testing strategies. But I'm excited that we have

165
0:17:11,120 --> 0:17:18,000
some data now to understand what's going on potentially with transmission with the Delta

166
0:17:18,000 --> 0:17:23,600
variant. What is going on? Is it spreading faster? What are the kinetics here? What's happening? So

167
0:17:23,600 --> 0:17:30,000
we got an interesting publication, viral infection and transmission in a large, well-traced outbreak

168
0:17:30,000 --> 0:17:35,920
caused by the Delta SARS-CoV-2 variant. And this was published by a group that was looking at

169
0:17:36,800 --> 0:17:43,360
cases in China. Now I've talked a bit about how sloppy the word transmissible is,

170
0:17:44,080 --> 0:17:50,240
and that when we hear that a certain virus, a certain variant is becoming dominant,

171
0:17:50,240 --> 0:17:55,280
we really need to understand the mechanism behind this variant's fitness advantage.

172
0:17:55,280 --> 0:18:00,560
And I think that this paper was a step in the right direction. So did we get any answers? Well,

173
0:18:00,560 --> 0:18:07,280
the authors investigated data from quarantine subjects in this Delta variant outbreak,

174
0:18:07,280 --> 0:18:14,560
and compared it to previous 2020 epidemic outbreaks caused by earlier variants.

175
0:18:14,560 --> 0:18:20,480
So a couple of questions that they tried to address. One is there a shorter reproductive

176
0:18:20,480 --> 0:18:25,840
time. So let me explain a little bit about what I mean by that. So you get exposed to someone who

177
0:18:26,400 --> 0:18:33,280
has SARS-CoV-2 infection, who has COVID-19, who is contagious, you have your exposure event.

178
0:18:34,480 --> 0:18:41,760
Now what is the time from exposure till you test positive or till you test positive and have

179
0:18:41,760 --> 0:18:47,200
enough virus that you can transmit it to the next individual? So this is the time for infection to

180
0:18:47,200 --> 0:18:52,160
becoming PCR positive and being able to give the virus to the next person, sort of a nuance of that.

181
0:18:53,120 --> 0:18:59,760
Now their results showed that the time interval from exposure to first PCR positivity in the

182
0:18:59,760 --> 0:19:09,840
quarantine population was four days versus six days. So six days was what we saw back in the 2020,

183
0:19:09,840 --> 0:19:14,320
and now we're seeing four days. So that's an interesting issue, and I'm going to talk a little

184
0:19:14,320 --> 0:19:20,880
bit about whether our experience meshes with this. The other thing that they saw, and I think this

185
0:19:20,880 --> 0:19:28,400
needs to be taken in context, that first positive test that they were seeing was a thousand times

186
0:19:28,400 --> 0:19:35,840
higher as far as the RNA copy number. So what we think we're seeing here is from zero. At day

187
0:19:35,840 --> 0:19:42,240
four people are already PCR positive, but they're already at a level of virus that makes them

188
0:19:42,240 --> 0:19:48,320
contagious. Now when we talked about day six turning PCR positive, usually at day six they

189
0:19:48,320 --> 0:19:54,320
were PCR positive, but at a high CT value, so a high cycle threshold, low level of virus,

190
0:19:54,880 --> 0:19:59,680
not quite transmitting, so you could pull them out before they spread it to the next person.

191
0:19:59,680 --> 0:20:05,040
Usually it was day seven that they were contagious. So instead of seven days from exposure to

192
0:20:05,040 --> 0:20:11,680
spreading to the next person, this may be shortened to only four days. So we're thinking that there

193
0:20:11,680 --> 0:20:19,360
is a more rapid rise from negative to infectious. People have looked at that thousand times higher,

194
0:20:19,360 --> 0:20:25,040
and I want to point out that's just looking at the first positive test. That's not the peak.

195
0:20:25,040 --> 0:20:30,480
We don't have the area under the curve. We did not follow these people every single day to see

196
0:20:30,480 --> 0:20:35,520
whether there's been a change in the duration at high levels, so the area under the curve,

197
0:20:35,520 --> 0:20:40,880
the period that they might become infectious. And I've sort of been asking, does this really

198
0:20:40,880 --> 0:20:45,280
mesh with our experience? And one of the things our listeners may know is we do these large

199
0:20:45,280 --> 0:20:51,040
screening programs for the movie industry, where we test thousands of people every night

200
0:20:51,040 --> 0:20:55,040
with the idea that we're going to catch them early when they first get positive,

201
0:20:55,040 --> 0:20:59,440
and that we've got this day before they become infectious. So someone tests positive on a Wednesday

202
0:20:59,440 --> 0:21:05,200
night. Usually it's a high CT value. We say, that's great. We grab you, we pull you out. We've been

203
0:21:05,200 --> 0:21:11,280
doing this for over a year without having any issues. What we're now seeing, unfortunately,

204
0:21:11,280 --> 0:21:17,360
is we're seeing a lot of people testing positive. The concern is when they test positive that night,

205
0:21:17,360 --> 0:21:22,400
they may have already been infectious in the latter half of the day. When we're talking to

206
0:21:22,400 --> 0:21:28,240
our outpatient providers, when someone says, Boy, I felt crummy for about a day. So I decided to

207
0:21:28,240 --> 0:21:35,440
finally get tested. Now you get them a PCR test. There's a 36 hour resulting delay. You call them

208
0:21:35,440 --> 0:21:40,480
and you say, John, your test is positive. We got to figure out who you may have exposed.

209
0:21:40,480 --> 0:21:45,120
When you test those people that they've exposed, those people are already positive,

210
0:21:45,120 --> 0:21:50,720
and they're already positive at high level. So this data is meshing with our experience.

211
0:21:50,720 --> 0:21:56,960
And as you can imagine, this really challenges our Tetris, our contact tracing paradigm.

212
0:21:56,960 --> 0:22:03,280
If by the time you tell someone that they're PCR positive, everyone they've exposed is also

213
0:22:03,280 --> 0:22:08,640
already PCR positive at a contagious level. It's already sort of spread to the next year,

214
0:22:08,640 --> 0:22:15,680
and it's kind of a dominoes type phenomenon. So this is one paper. This is meshing with our

215
0:22:15,680 --> 0:22:21,360
experience, but we need more data to help us with this because this is a problem. If it is a shorter

216
0:22:21,360 --> 0:22:26,480
incubation time, shorter from time to exposure to spreading, that could explain a lot of what we're

217
0:22:26,480 --> 0:22:30,480
seeing. It also is really relevant to how we're going to address this.

218
0:22:32,480 --> 0:22:38,320
If I may jump in, I was hoping that my dramatic pause would get you pulled in Vincent.

219
0:22:38,320 --> 0:22:44,960
Just two things first. So the shorter serial interval, that's what this is.

220
0:22:45,920 --> 0:22:52,160
That could account for a more rapid spread, but it doesn't mean the virus is more transmissible

221
0:22:52,160 --> 0:22:59,200
intrinsically. It just reproduces faster, and therefore can go from one host to another.

222
0:22:59,760 --> 0:23:04,800
Quicker in, as you said, people are infectious sooner, and that can result in more people being

223
0:23:04,800 --> 0:23:08,800
infected as a consequence. That's possible. But I would say it's not intrinsic,

224
0:23:09,520 --> 0:23:14,960
greater transmissibility of the virus. And then I agree we need more data on that.

225
0:23:14,960 --> 0:23:22,400
The other issue is that PCR, a thousand times, that might not be infectious virus. So I think

226
0:23:22,400 --> 0:23:26,960
at some point, people need to do infectious virus measurements. We have to stop depending

227
0:23:26,960 --> 0:23:33,040
on PCR, because I can imagine a variant throws off more MRNAs, and that's going to show up

228
0:23:33,040 --> 0:23:38,480
positive in the PCR, but it's not infectious virus. So nobody has done that for any of the

229
0:23:38,480 --> 0:23:44,800
variants yet, and I'm a little bit frustrated at that. Yeah, no, and I share your frustration,

230
0:23:44,800 --> 0:23:49,520
and I think that this is really, from my point, you can't just use the word transmissibly. You

231
0:23:49,520 --> 0:23:54,800
always say, what are you talking about? Because if it's a shorter incubation period, so many of

232
0:23:54,800 --> 0:24:01,840
our rules about when you contact trace, how long a person you say, we need to know the

233
0:24:01,840 --> 0:24:08,160
kinetics of infectious, viable virus for all the variants. We need to keep doing the research.

234
0:24:08,160 --> 0:24:12,480
We can't say, oh, we've got this for the, you know, because this is this is a problem.

235
0:24:13,120 --> 0:24:17,680
And I think also people have probably seen the Olympics when people are, quote, unquote, testing

236
0:24:17,680 --> 0:24:23,360
positive. What does that mean? Are they having a low level of RNA positivity? They actually have

237
0:24:23,360 --> 0:24:27,760
viable infectious virus. Do we need to pull Olympic athletes who've been vaccinated or

238
0:24:27,760 --> 0:24:31,760
young and healthy out for 10 days? Because that's what we did, you know, a year ago.

239
0:24:32,560 --> 0:24:36,800
Yeah, we need we can't be sloppy with our language because it matters. It affects

240
0:24:36,800 --> 0:24:44,720
it affects what we do. It affects people. All right, active vaccination. Never miss an

241
0:24:44,720 --> 0:24:50,000
opportunity to vaccinate vaccination is how this pandemic ends and no one is safe until we're all

242
0:24:50,000 --> 0:24:55,600
safe. And I know I get a lot of questions actually seem like I got a lot more this week and I'm not

243
0:24:55,600 --> 0:25:02,800
sure if it's that we're hitting a particular population, but they want to know, you know, if I had a

244
0:25:02,800 --> 0:25:12,240
COVID-19 before, if I had a natural infection, do I really need to get vaccinated? Maybe I'm just

245
0:25:12,240 --> 0:25:17,360
okay. And so I'm just going to take a little aside to, you know, I think all the clinicians

246
0:25:17,360 --> 0:25:22,560
that are getting these questions, I'm going to answer it for all of you. We do have information

247
0:25:22,560 --> 0:25:30,080
on this topic in three forms. So this is I had COVID-19. Do I need to get vaccinated? So one,

248
0:25:30,080 --> 0:25:36,480
we have a number of the serology and T cell studies, right? There was that nice paper in

249
0:25:36,480 --> 0:25:44,640
cell that we discussed back in June, reduced neutralization of SARS-CoV-2-B1617 by vaccine

250
0:25:44,640 --> 0:25:50,400
and convalescent serum, right? Because people really are now asking about the delta variant.

251
0:25:51,360 --> 0:25:56,880
You know, and we've talked a little bit about neutralizing antibody convalescent plasma. We

252
0:25:56,880 --> 0:26:03,760
also had reduced sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 variant delta to antibody neutralization published in

253
0:26:03,760 --> 0:26:09,920
nature. And that was just this month. Both papers suggesting convalescent plasma was about four

254
0:26:09,920 --> 0:26:17,200
times less potent against the delta variant. But if we've discussed many times, we don't really know,

255
0:26:17,200 --> 0:26:22,640
you know, what that translates into. We really sort of think that T cells are important.

256
0:26:22,640 --> 0:26:29,680
So we have some information on T cells in the paper, immunological memory to SARS-CoV-2

257
0:26:29,680 --> 0:26:36,240
assessed for up to eight months after infection. This is by Shane Crotty, an Los Androsetti's

258
0:26:36,240 --> 0:26:43,440
group. And this was in science. But, you know, here there's a couple things that we saw. And I'm

259
0:26:43,440 --> 0:26:50,800
going to throw in words like only to sort of emphasize things. Only 70% of individuals possessed

260
0:26:50,800 --> 0:26:58,240
detectable CD8 positive T cell memory at one month after infection that declined to 50% by

261
0:26:58,240 --> 0:27:06,880
six to eight months after infection. Not great, but CD4 T cell memory. 93% of subjects had

262
0:27:06,880 --> 0:27:12,320
detectable SARS-CoV-2 memory at a month after infection. And this remained high for six to eight

263
0:27:12,320 --> 0:27:20,560
months. So we also see T follicular helper cells being maintained. So we're sort of getting

264
0:27:20,560 --> 0:27:29,760
mixed here. Now, we did have the preprint also by these same gentleman, low dose mRNA 1273 COVID-19

265
0:27:29,760 --> 0:27:36,240
vaccine generates durable T cell memory and antibodies enhanced by preexisting cross-reactive T cell

266
0:27:36,240 --> 0:27:44,960
memory, where they report that spike. CD8 positive T cells were generated in 88% of subjects

267
0:27:44,960 --> 0:27:49,600
with equivalent percentages of CD8 positive T cell memory responders at six months post

268
0:27:49,600 --> 0:27:56,160
vaccine. So you're sort of seeing here that there looks like when we're looking at these lab-based

269
0:27:56,160 --> 0:28:01,600
studies of B cells T cells and serology, vaccines do look like they're a little bit better. And we

270
0:28:01,600 --> 0:28:06,960
have good data on the efficacy. We also have the reinfection studies. That's sort of when the

271
0:28:06,960 --> 0:28:12,800
rubber meets the road. And what happens when people have had natural infection and now they're

272
0:28:12,800 --> 0:28:19,120
exposed again. And I think we discussed before the siren study out of England. And that was SARS-CoV-2

273
0:28:19,120 --> 0:28:23,840
infection rates of antibody positive compared with antibody negative health care workers in

274
0:28:23,840 --> 0:28:31,760
England, a large multi-center prospective cohort study siren. And here this was Lancet suggesting

275
0:28:31,760 --> 0:28:38,960
a median duration effect of seven months at about 83% from prior infection with the same variant,

276
0:28:38,960 --> 0:28:44,880
right? So sort of raises concerns. And then we have this growing experience. What are we seeing

277
0:28:44,880 --> 0:28:50,240
as clinicians? And we are seeing our own growing experience of people who were infected early in

278
0:28:50,240 --> 0:28:58,240
the pandemic. So a year or more ago, now coming in, testing PCR positive, having symptoms and some

279
0:28:58,240 --> 0:29:03,120
of them not doing well. I think I may have shared the experience of the young woman who had long

280
0:29:03,120 --> 0:29:08,880
COVID after first infection, did not get a vaccine. And a couple weeks ago, she started to get ill

281
0:29:08,880 --> 0:29:14,640
again and again had a second infection. And I think now people ask, oh, can you test to see if

282
0:29:14,640 --> 0:29:22,000
it's a delta variant? Well, it's almost 90% of the sequences we're now seeing across the country are

283
0:29:22,000 --> 0:29:28,480
delta variants. So I think that, you know, the data may not be as compelling as some of the

284
0:29:28,480 --> 0:29:34,320
anti vaccinators or the hesitant might want to be. But we have really good compelling data on the

285
0:29:34,320 --> 0:29:40,080
safety and efficacy of vaccine. So we are across the board recommending that all people get vaccinated

286
0:29:40,080 --> 0:29:48,480
even if they have prior infection. All right. Now the period of detectable viral replication,

287
0:29:48,480 --> 0:29:53,760
this is going to be an exciting part. I'm looking for some emails. We had some very

288
0:29:53,760 --> 0:29:59,280
disturbing news, right? So this is the time for monitoring and monoclonals, not the time for

289
0:29:59,280 --> 0:30:06,560
antibiotics. But there was a bit of drama because a preprint that had been posted,

290
0:30:06,560 --> 0:30:13,440
suggesting that a randomized control trial demonstrated a 90% reduction in mortality and

291
0:30:13,440 --> 0:30:22,160
substantial in Ivermectin treated patients may have been something that never happened. So a London

292
0:30:22,160 --> 0:30:27,600
medical student named Jack Lawrence was the Woodward and Bernstein in this story, if people

293
0:30:27,600 --> 0:30:33,840
remember all the president's men. And he was investigating this preprint. And he discovered

294
0:30:33,840 --> 0:30:39,440
initially that the introductory section of the document appeared to have been almost entirely

295
0:30:39,440 --> 0:30:45,840
plagiarized and then run through a Thesaurus program. And it appears that the authors,

296
0:30:46,800 --> 0:30:52,720
they pulled entire paragraphs out of press releases and websites about Ivermectin.

297
0:30:53,360 --> 0:30:58,800
And then they changed these key words. The data appears to have been completely falsified.

298
0:30:58,800 --> 0:31:04,560
The tables in the article mathematically impossible. Apparently the study never happened.

299
0:31:04,560 --> 0:31:10,720
They just invented the study, invented the data, put it out there, really just a case of scientific

300
0:31:10,720 --> 0:31:17,040
fraud. So this data was part of a lot of these meta-analysis where people were saying,

301
0:31:17,040 --> 0:31:22,080
Oh, Ivermectin, it looks so promising. It's a crime to humanity that we're not using it when

302
0:31:22,080 --> 0:31:28,720
there's this study with a 90% mortality reduction. My hope is that all the people that have braced

303
0:31:28,720 --> 0:31:35,280
Ivermectin and are using it based on this kind of data will rethink their position and embrace

304
0:31:35,280 --> 0:31:43,360
the importance of honest scientific investigation. So now if someone is passionate about Ivermectin

305
0:31:43,360 --> 0:31:49,200
and they want to know, don't just make up data, don't just invent a study and put a preprint

306
0:31:50,080 --> 0:31:57,440
right now. And we've talked a little bit about this active sex, the COVID-19 study of repurposed

307
0:31:57,440 --> 0:32:06,000
medications is recruiting to properly study Ivermectin, fluvoxamine, and fluticosome. So

308
0:32:06,000 --> 0:32:11,280
if you're passionate, if you're excited about Ivermectin, you know, either enroll, direct your

309
0:32:11,280 --> 0:32:18,400
patients this way. We need good science, don't just make up science. All right.

310
0:32:20,240 --> 0:32:25,440
A little more information on the reliability of point of care rapid testing with the Abbott by

311
0:32:25,440 --> 0:32:31,920
next now with the publication of multidisciplinary assessment of the Abbott by next now SARS-CoV-2

312
0:32:31,920 --> 0:32:37,520
point of care antigen test in the context of emerging viral variants and self administration

313
0:32:38,080 --> 0:32:43,280
was published in nature scientific reports. And I know a lot of people I get, you know, at least

314
0:32:43,280 --> 0:32:48,720
every day, hey, do our tests still work against the Delta variant. You know, and I've talked a

315
0:32:48,720 --> 0:32:54,880
little bit about, you know, how it may go from these low level to high levels in hours instead of a

316
0:32:54,880 --> 0:33:03,760
day plus. And so what the authors here looked at the by next now, they looked at the Quidel

317
0:33:03,760 --> 0:33:12,160
Sophia to SARS test. They looked at the BD barator. They were all 100% concorded with RTPCR with

318
0:33:12,160 --> 0:33:19,920
CT values of less than 20. And then they started to lose sensitivity at higher CT values, or we

319
0:33:19,920 --> 0:33:27,280
translate that into lower RNA levels. So just a reminder, CT stands for cycle threshold. This

320
0:33:27,280 --> 0:33:33,280
is how many times you've got to run that PCR or that amplification before you get a positive

321
0:33:33,280 --> 0:33:39,840
signal. The higher the number of cycles, the lower amount of RNA that you started with.

322
0:33:40,960 --> 0:33:45,120
And as Vincent likes to point out, that's just RNA. That doesn't necessarily tell us about

323
0:33:45,120 --> 0:33:52,240
infectious virus. All right. And I think there's a correlation more in time than levels. So that's

324
0:33:52,240 --> 0:33:59,200
important. But what about this? You know, I get calls all the time. You know, is there one rapid

325
0:33:59,200 --> 0:34:03,760
test better than the other? And there are a lot of publications that come out and it seems like

326
0:34:03,760 --> 0:34:08,640
every time a publication comes out, I get a question. And just to give some context here,

327
0:34:08,640 --> 0:34:16,080
there are over 300 COVID-19 tests and collection kits authorized by the FDA. Over 200 molecular

328
0:34:16,080 --> 0:34:23,840
tests, we have 11 antigen tests. What about this? So the specificity, right? People say,

329
0:34:23,840 --> 0:34:27,600
Oh, well, not only are they're less sensitive, but they're less specific. If I get a positive

330
0:34:27,600 --> 0:34:33,760
on an antigen, I don't trust it as much. I'm going to say that if you get a positive test,

331
0:34:33,760 --> 0:34:41,920
the specificity of antigen tests is generally as high as our nucleic acid amplification tests,

332
0:34:41,920 --> 0:34:50,800
which means that a positive test on an antigen test is as reliable as a positive test on a PCR.

333
0:34:51,840 --> 0:34:56,400
There's a lot of experience, right? But just remember your prevalence of the community is

334
0:34:56,400 --> 0:35:01,920
going to help you interpret whether that positive test makes sensor or not. Now, what about

335
0:35:01,920 --> 0:35:08,480
sensitivity? Really straightforward. This is related to the amount of antigen that is present.

336
0:35:08,480 --> 0:35:14,480
If it's the first couple days that one to three days that corresponds with a CT value of less than

337
0:35:14,480 --> 0:35:19,440
20, as pointed out, we're getting sensitivities. We're getting concordance right up there at about

338
0:35:19,440 --> 0:35:26,240
100%. Once you get out to day seven, day eight, when that RNA level is dropping, when you're not

339
0:35:26,240 --> 0:35:30,320
really having much in the way of antigen, these tests are going to turn negative. So they're actually

340
0:35:30,320 --> 0:35:35,520
helpful when you think about what it's testing for. These are great at picking up that infectious

341
0:35:35,520 --> 0:35:40,320
period of time. They correspond with the infectious period of time. PCRs can sometimes stay positive

342
0:35:40,320 --> 0:35:46,240
for weeks for months. All right. And there was a really nice, I'm going to say Cochrane review,

343
0:35:46,240 --> 0:35:51,840
which they keep updating. Rapid point of care antigen and molecular-based tests for diagnosis

344
0:35:51,840 --> 0:36:01,680
of SARS-CoV-2. This is a 409-page document. So a nice light read. And it goes through different

345
0:36:01,680 --> 0:36:07,920
tests, their sensitivity and specificity at different CT levels. And so it's an excellent

346
0:36:07,920 --> 0:36:16,160
document. So don't let that latest publication shake your Earth, go ahead, look at this accumulation

347
0:36:16,160 --> 0:36:22,240
of data. Rapid point of care antigen tests have a role. That testing delay is leaving someone

348
0:36:22,240 --> 0:36:27,680
who's potentially infectious, wandering around, spreading it to others. All right. Another article

349
0:36:28,400 --> 0:36:35,920
on it describes that water is wet. Smart Chrysoplexus say. This is how antibacterial therapy is not

350
0:36:35,920 --> 0:36:42,000
helpful for the treatment of a virus. And this is the article effective oral azithromycin versus

351
0:36:42,000 --> 0:36:49,840
placebo on COVID-19 symptoms in outpatients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, a randomized control trial

352
0:36:49,840 --> 0:36:54,960
published in JAMA. And I think this is interesting. Some people think that, well, maybe the azithromycin

353
0:36:54,960 --> 0:37:00,560
will make my patient feel a little bit better. It does not. You're just, you know, inducing

354
0:37:00,560 --> 0:37:06,160
antibacterial resistance. So they did not see that antibiotics help viral infections.

355
0:37:06,160 --> 0:37:15,280
All right. We're getting near the end. So long COVID, right? I mentioned last time that post

356
0:37:15,280 --> 0:37:19,200
acute COVID syndrome. Apparently, when you're on a call with the CDC, they don't like the word.

357
0:37:19,200 --> 0:37:24,800
They don't like the phrase long COVID. They feel happier when you say packs. But I like long COVID

358
0:37:24,800 --> 0:37:30,800
because I think it actually points to something within the larger world of packs of post acute

359
0:37:30,800 --> 0:37:35,360
COVID syndromes. But what about the rest of the world? We talked about the U.S. and the UK.

360
0:37:35,360 --> 0:37:40,880
So we did see the article post discharge symptoms among hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Nigeria,

361
0:37:40,880 --> 0:37:45,600
a single center study, published in the American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.

362
0:37:46,320 --> 0:37:52,000
And basically, what they were pointing out is this was a small study, but the majority of their

363
0:37:52,000 --> 0:37:58,960
discharged patients were actually having symptoms continuing for months after discharge.

364
0:37:58,960 --> 0:38:04,960
I know a lot of people, you know, were very focused on the U.S., but outside the U.S., things

365
0:38:04,960 --> 0:38:12,400
continue to be really difficult. There was a nice paper, COVID-19 therapeutics for low and

366
0:38:12,400 --> 0:38:19,120
middle-income countries, a review of candidate agents with potential for near-term use and impact.

367
0:38:20,160 --> 0:38:26,080
And this was actually, you know, I think what you would expect. You've got to think about the

368
0:38:26,080 --> 0:38:32,240
resources in the area relative, you know, injectable tools, expensive therapies are not going to

369
0:38:32,240 --> 0:38:38,000
be able to play as big a part in this area. And there was actually a nice article,

370
0:38:39,600 --> 0:38:45,200
COVID-19 in Africa, a lesson in solidarity published in Lancet. Actually, my friend,

371
0:38:45,200 --> 0:38:51,280
Dr. Titus DiBali from Malawi brought this to my attention. But just pointing out, you can't just

372
0:38:51,280 --> 0:38:57,120
send vaccines to these countries. The same complexity applies there. You've got to have needles,

373
0:38:57,120 --> 0:39:01,520
you've got to have syringes, you've got to have trained people, and you actually have

374
0:39:01,520 --> 0:39:07,040
vaccine hesitancy and an interest in education in these areas, just like you do in the United

375
0:39:07,040 --> 0:39:12,080
States and Western Europe in many parts of the world. So to get those vaccines into arms

376
0:39:12,720 --> 0:39:18,640
is going to require a pretty large effort. And I actually made Vincent record this a little

377
0:39:18,640 --> 0:39:25,040
earlier today, because I'm going to be talking with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation COVID-19

378
0:39:25,040 --> 0:39:32,240
Task Force later to talk a little bit about these challenges. So as I like to say, we are not safe

379
0:39:32,240 --> 0:39:38,240
until everyone is safe. And to conclude on that note, just a couple weeks left here

380
0:39:38,880 --> 0:39:44,720
for our campaign to support Foundation International Medical Relief of Children. So go to parasites

381
0:39:44,720 --> 0:39:50,000
without borders. Before the end of July, we will double your donation. We're going to try to get up

382
0:39:50,000 --> 0:39:56,480
to a level where we can double that $20,000 and give a full $40,000 to support Foundation

383
0:39:56,480 --> 0:39:59,280
International Medical Relief of Children's efforts throughout the world.

384
0:40:00,400 --> 0:40:06,800
Daniel, when I went to our new office this week, I walked in and the lady shouted,

385
0:40:06,800 --> 0:40:16,720
parasites is here. All right, time for some questions for Daniel. You can send yours to

386
0:40:16,720 --> 0:40:24,720
Daniel at microbe.tv Kevin writes his favorite public speakers are Barack Obama and Dr. Daniel

387
0:40:24,720 --> 0:40:31,600
Griffin. All right, he has a question about his grandfather's immunization status in February.

388
0:40:31,600 --> 0:40:38,160
He got mRNA vaccine four days later tested positive for COVID. Thanks to your advocacy. I got

389
0:40:38,160 --> 0:40:44,560
him monoclonal therapy infection passed. My grandfather had only mild disease following CDC

390
0:40:44,560 --> 0:40:50,080
recommendation. He waited three months before getting the second dose of the mRNA vaccine. Last

391
0:40:50,080 --> 0:40:56,480
time we checked CDC recommendation for someone in the same circumstances does not need to restart

392
0:40:56,480 --> 0:41:00,720
the vaccine schedule. However, we're a little concerned that perhaps his first dose did not

393
0:41:00,720 --> 0:41:04,800
prime his immune system as well. What are your thoughts? We'd like to think he's well immunized

394
0:41:05,840 --> 0:41:10,880
after natural infection and at least one good dose of mRNA vaccine, but we're not completely

395
0:41:10,880 --> 0:41:18,880
confident. Yeah, so this is a great question. I suspect we're in a good situation here, right?

396
0:41:18,880 --> 0:41:24,000
There was a period of time at least where the immune system was learning from that first infection

397
0:41:24,000 --> 0:41:31,920
before the monoclonals jumped in there. That is the current recommendation. There's a science

398
0:41:31,920 --> 0:41:36,960
and there's an equity side to this, right, where should we be giving third doses to people when

399
0:41:36,960 --> 0:41:41,440
so much of the world hasn't even had their first dose? So a situation like this, you're

400
0:41:41,440 --> 0:41:47,680
probably in good shape. What we have sometimes done is if there's doses that might end up in

401
0:41:47,680 --> 0:41:52,160
the trash because we've had a no show, an individual like this might look at the whole picture and

402
0:41:52,160 --> 0:41:56,880
try to make a decision there relative to that. But no, this is the recommendation we think that

403
0:41:56,880 --> 0:42:02,400
this individual is protected, definitely a lot better protected than someone who has had no

404
0:42:02,400 --> 0:42:08,880
vaccination. Frank writes, why do you not mention the use of daily rapid tests at school as a high

405
0:42:08,880 --> 0:42:14,640
quality method eliminating COVID without restricting socialization? A dollar per student per day is

406
0:42:14,640 --> 0:42:20,160
not a burden. If the answer is waiting for FDA approval and high volume manufacturing, we need

407
0:42:20,160 --> 0:42:26,640
to know that and put more pressure on representatives. No, so, and actually when I've talked about

408
0:42:26,640 --> 0:42:34,000
schools in camps, rapid testing, actually testing can be a really important part of your multi-layered

409
0:42:34,000 --> 0:42:38,160
approach to keeping the kids safe. One of the things I will throw out, I think this is important

410
0:42:38,160 --> 0:42:43,120
as a thought experiment, right? Let's say you've got all these layers of protection, you want it,

411
0:42:43,120 --> 0:42:47,520
you're looking to try to get those masks off, right? So those kids can be in person in school with

412
0:42:47,520 --> 0:42:54,400
masks off. Let's say you have a breakdown and in that class of 25 individuals, you miss, right?

413
0:42:54,400 --> 0:42:59,440
Because the sensitivity of the test, someone comes in on a Monday, it's negative, you test

414
0:42:59,440 --> 0:43:04,800
Tuesday, they're positive, you realize, okay, if everyone's wearing masks, you may not have had

415
0:43:04,800 --> 0:43:08,720
an exposure event, you may have actually been able to avoid that, you may be able to move

416
0:43:08,720 --> 0:43:13,040
forward with only that one person coming out of the school. So you got to sort of balance this

417
0:43:13,040 --> 0:43:18,400
issue, is wearing masks such a burden that you're willing to take the risk of exposure events and

418
0:43:18,400 --> 0:43:24,240
all those implications? Or are you okay wearing masks in certain settings? So should there be a

419
0:43:24,240 --> 0:43:29,120
failure of your layers that you're not pulling everyone out for the quarantine and everything

420
0:43:29,120 --> 0:43:35,680
that sort of follows from that. And Laura from New Mexico writes, as COVID infections continue

421
0:43:35,680 --> 0:43:42,320
to rise, is it advisable for a fully vaccinated person who ends up with an infection to get monoclonal

422
0:43:42,320 --> 0:43:47,760
antibody treatment? I live in a somewhat medically underserved area, keep notes on the recommended

423
0:43:47,760 --> 0:43:52,480
treatment approaches. Should I need to be an advocate for myself or a loved one? My immediate

424
0:43:52,480 --> 0:43:56,080
family and the majority of my regular contacts are fully vaccinated, but I want to be prepared

425
0:43:56,080 --> 0:44:04,400
for the uptick in cases that is starting. Yeah, it is the role of monoclonals is not impacted by

426
0:44:04,400 --> 0:44:10,160
prior vaccination. So if an individual who has risk factors for progressing to severe disease

427
0:44:10,160 --> 0:44:16,720
does test positive, go right ahead with the monoclonals. Remember, the vaccines are great,

428
0:44:17,360 --> 0:44:23,920
but nothing's 100%. We have had a few hundred people, so it's a one in a million chance of dying

429
0:44:23,920 --> 0:44:29,120
if you get COVID. We've also had some people, I hate to say at least there are reports of individuals

430
0:44:29,120 --> 0:44:33,920
who got infected after a vaccine and ended up in the hospital or got long COVID. Go ahead,

431
0:44:33,920 --> 0:44:38,320
get the monoclonals. There's no reason not to, they're sitting on shelves, they're paid for by the

432
0:44:38,320 --> 0:44:47,040
government. So go ahead. And that's COVID-19 clinical update number 72 with Dr. Daniel Griffin.

433
0:44:47,040 --> 0:45:16,880
Thank you, Daniel. Oh, thank you. And everyone be safe.
