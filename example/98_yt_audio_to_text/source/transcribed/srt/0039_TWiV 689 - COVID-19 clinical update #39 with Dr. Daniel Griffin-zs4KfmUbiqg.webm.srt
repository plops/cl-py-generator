0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:06,880
This week in virology, the podcast about viruses, the kind that make you sick.

2
0:00:10,400 --> 0:00:20,960
From Microbe TV, this is Twiv. This week in virology, Episode 689 recorded on December 3, 2020.

3
0:00:20,960 --> 0:00:27,040
I'm Vincent Racken Yello, and you're listening to the podcast all about viruses. Joining me

4
0:00:27,040 --> 0:00:34,720
today from New York, Daniel Griffin. Hello, everyone. Vincent, do I say hello everyone or

5
0:00:34,720 --> 0:00:38,800
hello everybody? I think I alternate, right? I don't think it matters whatever you feel like

6
0:00:38,800 --> 0:00:44,720
on a given night. Yeah. All right, so let me start. I was emailing with my buddy, Peter Hotez,

7
0:00:44,720 --> 0:00:52,160
earlier today. And he was on the recent, what was it, stick to the Vax? I think that was a

8
0:00:52,160 --> 0:00:57,840
pun on stick to the Vax maybe. Peter Hotez, I'm going to, I'm going to put a disclaimer right up

9
0:00:57,840 --> 0:01:02,880
front. So, you know, this is similar to what you might hear when you get on an airplane. And they

10
0:01:02,880 --> 0:01:07,520
say, you know, this flight is headed to San Francisco. So if that is not your final destination,

11
0:01:07,520 --> 0:01:13,600
you might want to get off now. Right. And, you know, it may seem a while ago, but you know,

12
0:01:13,600 --> 0:01:18,080
when we started these, it was actually, I had come to Vincent, our listeners may not know this

13
0:01:18,080 --> 0:01:23,920
backstory. But we were trying to keep all the, all the physicians here in the New York Tri-State

14
0:01:23,920 --> 0:01:29,200
area updated on, you know, what we were learning, what was happening. And Vincent very generously

15
0:01:29,200 --> 0:01:33,760
sort of offered this forum as a chance for us to sort of once a week share that knowledge.

16
0:01:34,720 --> 0:01:40,240
So these updates started back in March. And it was all about, you know, what we were learning

17
0:01:40,240 --> 0:01:44,720
about COVID, the therapeutics, what we were seeing firsthand as practicing clinicians.

18
0:01:44,720 --> 0:01:50,080
So, you know, it's really what we're here to share is the truth of what we're seeing. There's

19
0:01:50,080 --> 0:01:54,560
no real agenda here. We're not trying to grow any audience. At some point, maybe Vincent will

20
0:01:54,560 --> 0:01:59,040
kick me off if, you know, no one wants to listen to me anymore. But this has been, I think,

21
0:01:59,040 --> 0:02:03,680
a tremendous service. So I want to thank Vincent for that. But I will say this is, there's no warm

22
0:02:03,680 --> 0:02:08,480
soup here. I'm not here to make these difficult times easier. I'm just here to basically share

23
0:02:08,480 --> 0:02:14,080
what's going on, what we're learning, the cold, hard truth. Oddly enough, I think some anti-vaxxers,

24
0:02:14,080 --> 0:02:19,280
I've been told the word trolls is applicable here at times. But, you know, for the next 30

25
0:02:19,280 --> 0:02:27,040
minutes, we're not going to talk about anti-vaxx theories. So if you tuned in accidentally to the

26
0:02:27,040 --> 0:02:32,080
wrong podcast, this might be time to jump off the next 30 minutes, you're never going to get them

27
0:02:32,080 --> 0:02:39,440
back. So, you know, spend them well. Okay. Now that I have made my disclaimer, my quotation,

28
0:02:39,440 --> 0:02:46,880
one ought never to turn one's back on a threatened danger, but to try to run away from it. If you

29
0:02:46,880 --> 0:02:51,920
do that, you will double the danger. But if you meet it promptly and without flinching, you will

30
0:02:51,920 --> 0:02:59,200
reduce the danger by half. And can people guess who that's, that's Winston again. I like Winston

31
0:02:59,200 --> 0:03:05,040
Churchill. Now, these are, these are dark times already. People keep saying, oh, we've got a dark

32
0:03:05,040 --> 0:03:09,680
winter ahead of us. But you know, there are over 100,000 Americans in the hospital right now with

33
0:03:09,680 --> 0:03:18,080
COVID-19. And, you know, yesterday, the numbers were almost 3000 today, we have over 3000 people

34
0:03:18,080 --> 0:03:23,920
who died here in the US of COVID-19. We've reached capacity at the hospitals here in New York.

35
0:03:25,040 --> 0:03:28,640
You know, I got a alert from one of the hospitals yesterday, you know, we have, you know,

36
0:03:29,360 --> 0:03:34,560
numbers of people stuck here in the ER because there's no open beds. The ICUs are overflowing

37
0:03:34,560 --> 0:03:40,880
into the other areas. This is not a great sign. I mean, we are not even seeing the post Thanksgiving

38
0:03:40,880 --> 0:03:47,360
search. So just want people to sort of think about when they're making their decisions. We are as

39
0:03:47,360 --> 0:03:52,400
bad right now as it has ever gotten. More people died today than have ever died in a single day

40
0:03:52,400 --> 0:03:58,080
from COVID-19 here in the States. More people are in the hospital right now with COVID-19 than ever.

41
0:03:58,080 --> 0:04:05,040
So really think about that. All right, let's move through our phases, our pre-exposure period.

42
0:04:05,840 --> 0:04:11,280
A little update here for our clinicians. I got a lot of questions about this. New York has now

43
0:04:11,280 --> 0:04:16,640
recommended broader use of eye protection. And I know we've talked a little bit about the science

44
0:04:16,640 --> 0:04:20,800
behind this. You know, it takes a little while for the recommendations to catch up with the

45
0:04:20,800 --> 0:04:25,840
science, but New York State Department of Health now strongly recommends universal use of eye

46
0:04:25,840 --> 0:04:31,120
protection by healthcare personnel for all patient interactions. And this is in addition to the

47
0:04:31,120 --> 0:04:36,560
face masks. And I got an email sort of asking about this and it was entertaining. So it was a whole

48
0:04:36,560 --> 0:04:41,440
loop. You know, it was a number of clinicians in a clinic and one of them emailed me saying,

49
0:04:41,440 --> 0:04:45,520
you know, we only do well visits. We don't let people come in if they're sick and not sure if

50
0:04:45,520 --> 0:04:51,200
this really applies to me. And so I responded back and said, you think they're well visits.

51
0:04:51,200 --> 0:04:56,320
But you know, what percent of those people are pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic? And that's

52
0:04:56,320 --> 0:05:00,720
really the thing. If you get a call the next day and they say, you know what, I wasn't feeling 100%

53
0:05:00,720 --> 0:05:04,880
when I saw you. And today I just got a test. And you were not wearing your eye protection.

54
0:05:05,920 --> 0:05:11,440
That's a potential exposure. So, you know, this is really moving into a universal precautions

55
0:05:11,440 --> 0:05:17,840
approach, at least for the foreseeable future here. You know, for front facing healthcare workers,

56
0:05:17,840 --> 0:05:23,120
we'll talk about why there is a finite period of time that we're going to need to be practicing

57
0:05:23,120 --> 0:05:29,040
this really high level of caution. But universal recommendation here in New York when clinicians

58
0:05:29,040 --> 0:05:34,400
are interacting. And I extend this to all staff. When you're within that six feet, when you're

59
0:05:34,400 --> 0:05:40,160
going to potentially be at risk, protect your mouth, protect your nose and protect your eyes.

60
0:05:41,600 --> 0:05:47,360
People are still taking zinc, vitamin D, vitamin C. This all seems fine. And there was a nice

61
0:05:47,360 --> 0:05:54,640
article in nature, analysis of vitamin D levels among asymptomatic and critically ill COVID-19

62
0:05:54,640 --> 0:06:00,400
patients. And it's correlation with inflammatory markers. But you know, I'm going to sort of push

63
0:06:00,400 --> 0:06:05,360
out here again, say we really need to do some randomized control trials. I mean, we currently

64
0:06:05,360 --> 0:06:12,080
in the US spend over a billion dollars a year, over a billion dollars a year on vitamin D supplements

65
0:06:12,080 --> 0:06:17,920
and testing. That's a lot of money. It would be nice to know, like, you know, is that being,

66
0:06:17,920 --> 0:06:23,440
is that well spent money? So, you know, if it's not, then you could give a little bit of that,

67
0:06:23,440 --> 0:06:29,280
you know, Vincent in the lab. So, you know, or support micro TV. But no, it's, it's important.

68
0:06:29,280 --> 0:06:33,200
You know, we do a lot of, we do a lot of studies looking at, you know, small molecule inhibitors,

69
0:06:33,200 --> 0:06:37,360
pharmaceutical agents. Vitamin D is something a lot of people take for a lot of different

70
0:06:37,360 --> 0:06:44,400
reasons. It would make sense to really understand its role in COVID-19. I also want to talk about

71
0:06:44,400 --> 0:06:48,880
testing here, right? This is hopefully the pre-exposure period. Hopefully you haven't been

72
0:06:48,880 --> 0:06:54,000
exposed yet. And we really ramped up testing over the last couple weeks here. I was doing in

73
0:06:54,960 --> 0:06:59,520
one of those, I call them the microphone bokeh interviews this morning. You know,

74
0:06:59,520 --> 0:07:03,040
you've got a whole bunch of microphones and, you know, you're not sure who you're talking to,

75
0:07:03,040 --> 0:07:08,560
but you look at the, the sea of cameras. And we were talking about what we've done with

76
0:07:09,440 --> 0:07:14,400
rapid testing in the last few weeks. You know, and I was there with Bonnie Simmons. She's the

77
0:07:14,400 --> 0:07:20,320
head of our Tri-State Urgent Cares. She's my buddy, Adam Fitterstein's boss. And she just, you know,

78
0:07:20,320 --> 0:07:22,960
she always wonders, again, you know, ever I call you pick up the phone, I'm like,

79
0:07:22,960 --> 0:07:27,680
Bonnie, you're kind of a hero of mine. You know, you really allowed us to make this happen,

80
0:07:27,680 --> 0:07:33,920
all this rapid testing. And what we saw right before Thanksgiving is a lot of people were going

81
0:07:33,920 --> 0:07:39,520
and getting tested. A lot of people with asymptomatic and presymptomatic infections were being picked

82
0:07:39,520 --> 0:07:45,120
up, diagnosed, sort of pulled out, contact tracing, and then those people were being picked out. And

83
0:07:45,120 --> 0:07:48,800
I really think, you know, we were, we were saving lives here. We were detecting people

84
0:07:48,800 --> 0:07:53,200
before they went to those gatherings. We were picking up who else was infected that they were

85
0:07:53,200 --> 0:07:59,440
interacting with. And so this is really, really taken on and people are realizing the utility.

86
0:08:00,000 --> 0:08:05,680
You know, two days before symptoms, five days of symptoms, the rapid test gives you a result in

87
0:08:05,680 --> 0:08:11,360
about 15 minutes has really been tremendous. This is free, right? This is something that we,

88
0:08:11,360 --> 0:08:15,120
you know, as a society are picking up. This is not something we charged people for.

89
0:08:15,760 --> 0:08:20,160
And I was there this morning. It was quite cold. And there were two lines of cars, you know,

90
0:08:20,160 --> 0:08:24,000
and just sort of going around the quarter. And these were all people that were basically driving

91
0:08:24,000 --> 0:08:29,120
up, getting swab, they would then drive on. And by the time they got to work, school, home,

92
0:08:30,000 --> 0:08:33,840
they would be alerted by the results and basically told like, you know, if you just got to work,

93
0:08:33,840 --> 0:08:39,280
stay in your car, turn around, go home. Or otherwise, all right, you're clear and can move forward. So

94
0:08:40,400 --> 0:08:45,280
so much more helpful than, you know, finding out in four or five days after you've exposed

95
0:08:45,280 --> 0:08:50,160
people that oh, by the way, when you went to that Thanksgiving dinner, when you went to work, when

96
0:08:50,160 --> 0:08:54,240
you went to school, you were shedding fire really embracing this. And a lot of people are moving

97
0:08:54,240 --> 0:09:02,000
in this direction. Now vaccines. All right. I'll call this better than vitamin D, right? If you

98
0:09:02,000 --> 0:09:06,480
have a choice, a good vaccine or vitamin D, I'm going with the vaccine. I might also, at some

99
0:09:06,480 --> 0:09:10,720
point remember to take some of that vitamin D that's still sitting on the shelf in my medicine

100
0:09:10,720 --> 0:09:17,600
cabinet, only growing in value, I'm sure. So we got more information. And it's always amazing as I

101
0:09:17,600 --> 0:09:22,880
was like, how is this really only the last week? It always seems like old news, but we got more

102
0:09:22,880 --> 0:09:29,120
information on the Moderna vaccine. And Moderna has now applied for EUA for their vaccine. And some

103
0:09:29,120 --> 0:09:34,160
of this was covered in the previous 12. So listen for more in depth there. But what do we as clinicians

104
0:09:34,160 --> 0:09:43,520
are going to bullet point this? Moderna reported a vaccine efficacy of about 94.1%. And if you

105
0:09:43,520 --> 0:09:49,680
looked at the secondary endpoint, severe disease, 100%, no one who received the Moderna vaccine ended

106
0:09:49,680 --> 0:09:57,600
up requiring an ER visit or hospital care. It also was reported that the vaccine was well tolerated.

107
0:09:57,600 --> 0:10:02,560
There were no serious safety concerns. And I'll sort of make the point here, the difference

108
0:10:02,560 --> 0:10:08,640
between reactogenicity and severe adverse effects. You get the vaccine, feel a little under the

109
0:10:08,640 --> 0:10:14,720
weather for a day or two. Shane Crotty has been tweeting out. I've been retweeting this. It's

110
0:10:14,720 --> 0:10:18,880
the rock, Dwayne Reed, the rock. And he goes to the gym. And he's really sore the next day. That's

111
0:10:18,880 --> 0:10:24,640
kind of what it's like. That's the reactogenicity. That's your immune system learning. And then

112
0:10:24,640 --> 0:10:29,360
you move forward, but no serious safety concerns. And now we have about 70,000 people that have

113
0:10:29,360 --> 0:10:35,600
been vaccinated. We've got months of this. So we've exceeded two months of median follow-up

114
0:10:35,600 --> 0:10:43,040
post vaccination as required by the US FDA for the EUA. So we'll be seeing that reviewed on the 17th.

115
0:10:43,040 --> 0:10:48,560
That's the other bullet point. Thursday, December 17th, the Moderna vaccine is scheduled to be

116
0:10:48,560 --> 0:10:57,120
reviewed. What do we know so far? This primary analysis that we got is an update 196 cases,

117
0:10:57,120 --> 0:11:06,080
of which 185 cases of COVID-19 were observed in the placebo group. Only 11 cases in the vaccinated

118
0:11:06,080 --> 0:11:13,200
group. And then as mentioned, all the severe cases were in people that had not gotten vaccinated.

119
0:11:14,080 --> 0:11:19,760
Someone died. And that was another person who did not get vaccinated. So pretty impressive. So

120
0:11:19,760 --> 0:11:25,280
between Pfizer and Moderna projections are that we should have enough vaccine for approximately 40

121
0:11:25,280 --> 0:11:31,120
million doses by the end of this month. We expect to start vaccinating people this month.

122
0:11:32,400 --> 0:11:37,920
70 million doses per month starting in January of projection as we will have the ability to

123
0:11:37,920 --> 0:11:44,240
vaccinate 100 million Americans by the end of February. Pfizer Ultra cold vaccine did just get

124
0:11:44,240 --> 0:11:49,120
approval in the UK. So people probably have heard about that. So I'm just going to hit a couple

125
0:11:49,120 --> 0:11:56,400
important dates for our clinicians to keep an eye on. One already passed December 1st, the ACIP.

126
0:11:56,400 --> 0:12:00,800
This is the advisory committee on vaccines. And this was a little bit different, right?

127
0:12:00,800 --> 0:12:06,160
Normally this committee meets after a vaccine is licensed, and then they give advice on who should

128
0:12:06,160 --> 0:12:11,040
get it. So this is a little bit of a twist. They met and they said, so when a vaccine gets

129
0:12:11,040 --> 0:12:16,480
an EUA, we're going to give some preemptive recommendations on who should be prioritized.

130
0:12:16,480 --> 0:12:21,920
And my wife really liked this because initially they had, we're going to have phase one and two

131
0:12:21,920 --> 0:12:27,680
and sort of down the line. So what they did is they created phase one A, B, and C. This is

132
0:12:27,680 --> 0:12:35,280
the way a whole bunch of people are in phase one. So I thought that was clever. And what they did

133
0:12:35,280 --> 0:12:39,440
basically is nothing that surprised anyone. They said, hey, we're going to do healthcare workers

134
0:12:39,440 --> 0:12:45,760
right up front. And then we're going to sort of move down the line. We'll be moving into educators

135
0:12:45,760 --> 0:12:52,560
and firefighters and police officers and people in food and sort of really like critical people.

136
0:12:52,560 --> 0:12:58,160
And then we're going to move into phase one C. And that's the 65 and over. So I'm going to talk

137
0:12:58,160 --> 0:13:02,080
a little bit about one. I think people will actually see the vaccine. So December 10th,

138
0:13:02,080 --> 0:13:07,120
that's a week from the time we're recording this. The FDA will review the Pfizer vaccine.

139
0:13:07,840 --> 0:13:14,320
December 17th, the FDA will review the Moderna vaccine. And just to talk a little bit about the

140
0:13:14,320 --> 0:13:20,560
numbers, front facing healthcare workers, this is phase one a healthcare personnel. And this

141
0:13:20,560 --> 0:13:26,560
includes like, you know, EMTs, EMS, and also that it's going to move right into the long term care

142
0:13:26,560 --> 0:13:31,600
facility residents. You too, right? This is all. What's that? Are you included in that?

143
0:13:32,800 --> 0:13:36,480
In the long term care facility resident or the health care health care?

144
0:13:36,480 --> 0:13:45,600
I am actually. Yeah. I'm actually, you know, I think I was talking with people I work with and

145
0:13:45,600 --> 0:13:50,880
may have I think I may have seen more COVID patients or had more exposure to COVID patients

146
0:13:50,880 --> 0:13:56,400
than anyone else I know. So yeah, I have a lot of exposure. You know, I go see people in the ER,

147
0:13:56,400 --> 0:14:01,200
see people in the ICU, I see people, you know, out in the urgent care settings as well in the

148
0:14:01,200 --> 0:14:07,360
clinics. So yeah, if you can get exposed to COVID, I make it my business. So Daniel,

149
0:14:07,360 --> 0:14:11,520
are you going to feel somewhat relieved that you have a vaccine?

150
0:14:13,120 --> 0:14:17,920
Tremendously, tremendously relieved, actually. You know, and this I'm going to answer that

151
0:14:17,920 --> 0:14:20,560
question. I keep skirting, right? People keep saying, Dan, you know, are you going to get the

152
0:14:20,560 --> 0:14:25,280
vaccine and when, you know, and I heard Barack Obama, he's like, can I get the vaccine as soon as it's

153
0:14:25,280 --> 0:14:29,680
ready? You know, and I think that's the thing. A week from today, when we're recording this on

154
0:14:29,680 --> 0:14:34,240
Thursday, so a week from today, the FDA is going to have the review of the Pfizer vaccine. All the

155
0:14:34,240 --> 0:14:38,800
information is going to be out. One of the people on our vaccine committee is going to be tasked

156
0:14:38,800 --> 0:14:43,920
with, you know, listening to all the questions, reviewing all the data. So hopefully when we

157
0:14:43,920 --> 0:14:49,120
record next time, I'll have all the information to go ahead and say, yes, I feel like this is safe

158
0:14:49,120 --> 0:14:54,320
where ready to go. Or if something comes up, I'll let people know otherwise. But yeah, I anticipate

159
0:14:54,320 --> 0:15:00,880
a little more than a week after this drops. I'll be getting in line for my vaccine and planning on

160
0:15:01,440 --> 0:15:06,800
I'll stream that live on YouTube or something. Get someone to tape it on your iPhone, record it

161
0:15:06,800 --> 0:15:12,400
on your iPhone, we can splice it in here. Okay, yeah, because I think I think that that will help

162
0:15:12,400 --> 0:15:16,320
people. You know, you want to see someone, you know, I was talking to my mom earlier today,

163
0:15:16,320 --> 0:15:20,240
I answered it no one other than the truth. And she's like, yes, well aware of that.

164
0:15:20,240 --> 0:15:27,040
So yeah, I'm going to get the vaccine if I feel like it's safe and effective. And I think that

165
0:15:27,040 --> 0:15:30,320
that will sort of help get the message out there. But I don't think it's safe and effective. I'm

166
0:15:30,320 --> 0:15:36,800
going to I'm going to wait until I feel confident. So hopefully that'll help our listeners. So yeah,

167
0:15:36,800 --> 0:15:42,720
phase one A is going to start in December, we are all ramped up and ready to go. Then we move into

168
0:15:42,720 --> 0:15:48,480
phase one B and that's all the essential workers I mentioned. So education, food and agriculture,

169
0:15:48,480 --> 0:15:53,520
police, firefighters, correctional officers, transportation, that's going to start in January.

170
0:15:53,520 --> 0:15:58,320
And then phase one C, that's 65 and over. That's sort of our high risk. That's going to be January

171
0:15:58,320 --> 0:16:05,520
moving into February. So this is really happening pretty quick. So this is good stuff. Once we once

172
0:16:05,520 --> 0:16:10,560
we move into March, that's when we're really moving into wider distribution. And children,

173
0:16:10,560 --> 0:16:15,120
people wonder about children has been tested on children yet. But Pfizer has announced that

174
0:16:15,120 --> 0:16:20,160
they're going to be starting to test in the 12 to 18 year old population. They're going to have

175
0:16:20,160 --> 0:16:27,200
3000 people in that initial venture, I should say, Moderna has also said they're going to be moving

176
0:16:27,200 --> 0:16:31,760
their vaccine into that population as well. So we're going to have important information on can

177
0:16:31,760 --> 0:16:37,840
we use this vaccine in younger individuals. 18 is kind of arbitrary, right? I'm not sure how

178
0:16:37,840 --> 0:16:44,080
immunology and the right to vote somehow peg that 18. And I was worried when they raised a drinking

179
0:16:44,080 --> 0:16:50,000
age to 21 that that would somehow but now I mean, I'm really arbitrary there. So I did want to talk

180
0:16:50,000 --> 0:16:56,640
a little bit actually about this whole ultra cold thing with Pfizer, right? And we always talk about

181
0:16:56,640 --> 0:17:01,920
vaccine hesitancy. And we're talking about the patients being hesitant. But unfortunately, I think

182
0:17:01,920 --> 0:17:06,880
because of some issues with communication here, we've had vaccine hesitancy on the part of

183
0:17:06,880 --> 0:17:11,120
clinics, physicians, healthcare organizations saying, you know, I just don't want to have to

184
0:17:11,120 --> 0:17:15,360
deal with Pfizer and this ultra cold. And I don't want to buy these deep freezers.

185
0:17:15,360 --> 0:17:19,280
Or the other side is you have all these people spending really a lot of money

186
0:17:19,280 --> 0:17:24,880
buying these, you know, these freezers. So I'll talk a little bit about this. So I'm on this

187
0:17:24,880 --> 0:17:32,320
National Vaccine Initiative Committee. And actually, Wednesday, so yesterday, I was in a meeting

188
0:17:32,320 --> 0:17:38,640
with basically our whole group and Pfizer's medical director. This is, I believe, Catherine

189
0:17:38,640 --> 0:17:45,120
Jansen is her name, really bright woman. After the after the conversation, I talked to John

190
0:17:45,120 --> 0:17:51,520
hit who's like our senior person. And he was actually saying, you know, I guess when you have a lot

191
0:17:51,520 --> 0:17:58,560
of money, you can hire really good people. So I was impressed by that. But they've really

192
0:17:58,560 --> 0:18:03,920
figured this stuff out. It's pretty amazing. They've got these thermal shippers, which really are

193
0:18:03,920 --> 0:18:09,200
a little bit larger than we'll say like five personal pizza boxes. So it's really five personal

194
0:18:09,200 --> 0:18:15,600
pizza boxes. Each personal pizza box has about 200 miles, actually, 195 miles, five doses per

195
0:18:15,600 --> 0:18:21,440
mile. And they're in this box surrounded by dry ice. We'll talk a little about dry ice.

196
0:18:22,240 --> 0:18:30,320
And basically send this out. So five, you know, you could say 195 times five. So about 1000 doses

197
0:18:30,320 --> 0:18:35,520
in this thermal shipper. And that thermal shipper itself is basically a deep freezer. You know,

198
0:18:35,520 --> 0:18:40,080
you repack it with dry ice every few days, everything is in there. You don't have to buy one of these

199
0:18:40,080 --> 0:18:45,520
deep freezers. It's small enough that it fits under a desk. They even spend, they even send you these

200
0:18:45,520 --> 0:18:49,440
special thermal gloves. I asked about that on the call. I'm like, how am I going to touch those,

201
0:18:49,440 --> 0:18:54,000
you know, negative 70 degree things? Because I remember, you know, going into the deep freeze,

202
0:18:54,000 --> 0:18:58,720
you know, and you pull it out and you get freezer burn on your fingers. So they send goggles,

203
0:18:58,720 --> 0:19:03,760
they send special gloves, you grab as many vials as you want, let them come up to room temperature,

204
0:19:04,400 --> 0:19:09,760
add some saline, inverted a few times, and then fill your syringes. So it's really,

205
0:19:10,320 --> 0:19:15,440
really user friendly, really something that can get out there. And it's actually something not

206
0:19:15,440 --> 0:19:18,720
only that I think we're going to do here in the US, but there's already plans to use the same

207
0:19:18,720 --> 0:19:23,520
technology throughout Sub-Saharan Africa, you know, low middle income countries as well. So

208
0:19:23,520 --> 0:19:30,000
really no issues here. Everyone should start getting signed up, registered so they can make

209
0:19:30,000 --> 0:19:35,760
this happen. You get your first dose with Pfizer, three weeks later, you get your second dose,

210
0:19:35,760 --> 0:19:40,720
and within five days, you are at these wonderful levels of protection that we've all heard about.

211
0:19:40,720 --> 0:19:45,120
Just want to sort of let people know that this whole cold storage, ultra cold stuff,

212
0:19:45,120 --> 0:19:50,640
it's really not an issue. Pfizer's worked this out. And so there'll be a little details adjusted

213
0:19:50,640 --> 0:19:55,040
at sort of the endpoint once the FDA comes and says, this is exactly the way we want you to do

214
0:19:55,040 --> 0:19:59,840
it. How many times can you recharge that thermal freezer with your, you know, with your, what kind

215
0:19:59,840 --> 0:20:06,560
of ice is that? Dry ice. And I promised I would mention dry ice. And I'm going to make a video

216
0:20:06,560 --> 0:20:11,520
this weekend on homemade drugs, because everyone's like, Oh my gosh, we're going to run out of dry

217
0:20:11,520 --> 0:20:17,520
ice. And it's really easy to make. And you know, don't try this at home. People will listen and do

218
0:20:17,520 --> 0:20:22,320
that when I say that. But you know, you can really just take one of those CO2 fire extinguishers

219
0:20:22,320 --> 0:20:27,440
and a cloth bag and either tape it or have a really good glove and you blast into the bag and

220
0:20:27,440 --> 0:20:32,480
presto, you have dry ice. So I'll be, I'll be blasting that on Twitter this weekend. But

221
0:20:32,480 --> 0:20:37,120
yeah, we're not going to run out of dry ice. It's easy to make dry ice. We've got lots of CO2.

222
0:20:37,120 --> 0:20:42,480
We're good to go. Apparently, there was a CO2 shortage in England a couple of years back. You

223
0:20:42,480 --> 0:20:47,200
know, they couldn't make beer or something. So nothing to worry about. All right, let's move

224
0:20:47,200 --> 0:20:54,240
into our incubation post exposure period. That little changes here, right? The CDC updated its

225
0:20:54,240 --> 0:20:59,520
guidance. And they basically said, this makes sense. I've been talking about this for a little

226
0:20:59,520 --> 0:21:04,240
while, but now it's official. You know, when we used to say you got exposed, now you got to

227
0:21:04,240 --> 0:21:10,640
quarantine for 14 days, my wife, her famous, that's excessive. So yeah, she's right. Nobody did that.

228
0:21:10,640 --> 0:21:16,160
So now what they've said is what you can do is at the end of seven days, get a test.

229
0:21:16,160 --> 0:21:21,520
If the test is negative, then you can move forward. So that was just updated December 2nd.

230
0:21:22,480 --> 0:21:26,880
And this does not need to be a PCR. They don't specify that you can go ahead and get your rapid

231
0:21:26,880 --> 0:21:32,720
test 15 minutes later, you find out you're good to go, you move forward. So I say that's, that's

232
0:21:32,720 --> 0:21:38,720
really positive. All right, now we move into the viral symptom phase. Now, unfortunately,

233
0:21:38,720 --> 0:21:42,800
you have you have not missed the bullet. You've actually got infected. You're starting to have

234
0:21:42,800 --> 0:21:51,280
symptoms, just some monoclonal antibody updates. You know, people, people have not really forgotten

235
0:21:51,280 --> 0:21:57,600
about the monoclonal antibodies. There still tends to be a tremendous demand. And actually,

236
0:21:57,600 --> 0:22:03,680
when this when this episode drops on Saturday, there'll be some stuff in the news about Eli

237
0:22:03,680 --> 0:22:08,560
Lilly and my involvement with them. So tell people to watch the news and we'll talk more about this

238
0:22:08,560 --> 0:22:13,680
next week. But I did want to add a little bit of a discussion. I was listening to TWIV 688.

239
0:22:14,560 --> 0:22:19,040
And there was a whole discussion about subcutaneous versus intradermal and the half life of the

240
0:22:19,040 --> 0:22:25,680
antibodies. You know, it reminded me of of rabies when the when the woman who wrote in was talking

241
0:22:25,680 --> 0:22:30,320
about injecting herself in the belly and all these different things. So just a couple of things to

242
0:22:30,320 --> 0:22:35,280
talk about. So intradermal, if anyone ever had their their skin test for tuberculosis,

243
0:22:35,280 --> 0:22:39,120
that's where you put the needle just a little under the skin and you raise a little blab,

244
0:22:39,120 --> 0:22:45,120
that's intradermal. That's in the skin. Subcutaneous is sort of down in the fat layer,

245
0:22:45,120 --> 0:22:49,360
but above the muscle. So you're not getting into the muscle, you're, you know, you pull a nice chunk

246
0:22:49,360 --> 0:22:54,320
of fat. It's easy to do on me, particularly because I don't go to the gym anymore. But, you know,

247
0:22:54,320 --> 0:23:00,640
one day it'll be harder, hopefully. You know, the rest of my life is so hard. Why is my belly so soft?

248
0:23:00,640 --> 0:23:06,400
But you grab a nice chunk and you put the injection in there. The reason we're studying monoclonal

249
0:23:06,400 --> 0:23:11,200
antibodies in the subcutaneous is you don't have to go to a clinic. You don't have to go to a hospital.

250
0:23:11,200 --> 0:23:16,320
Anyone can grab a nice chunk and inject in the way they do with Proleia, for instance, some of our

251
0:23:16,320 --> 0:23:21,600
other medicines. So we're studying that as well. Why do you do four different sites? It's a question

252
0:23:21,600 --> 0:23:27,680
of volume at this point. It's just sort of a large volume. What about half-life? The half-life

253
0:23:27,680 --> 0:23:33,920
is different with the different antibody preparations. So the Eli Lilly, the BAM BAM, the BAM Linibin

254
0:23:33,920 --> 0:23:38,960
map, half-life is about 21 days. They get a really high dose. 21 days, it's about half of that.

255
0:23:40,240 --> 0:23:45,520
The half-life is a little bit longer with the Regeneron antibodies. And I think I mentioned

256
0:23:45,520 --> 0:23:50,480
GSK has made a stock modification, so there anybody has an even longer half-life. So

257
0:23:51,280 --> 0:23:56,000
next thing I guess I'll mention is that this is passive immunity. So when you give someone this

258
0:23:56,000 --> 0:24:02,480
infusion or you do the subcutaneous injection, then you're not going to see an immune response.

259
0:24:02,480 --> 0:24:06,240
You're not going to see lymph nodes. You're not going to see soreness at the site.

260
0:24:06,240 --> 0:24:11,120
About 2% of the time people get a little bit itchy. So that's why we sort of observed them.

261
0:24:11,120 --> 0:24:14,480
Get a little bit itchy. We give them Benadryl has been an issue to date. So

262
0:24:15,600 --> 0:24:23,040
making some progress there. The early inflammatory phase. People should go back and listen to

263
0:24:23,040 --> 0:24:29,920
immune 39, a Tonka truck full of salt. And they have a discussion right at about 57 minutes about

264
0:24:29,920 --> 0:24:38,160
the cytokine storm. And the whole early inflammatory response is really a sophisticated, complicated

265
0:24:38,160 --> 0:24:45,200
thing. And it reminded me of a book and a movie based on the same book, Smilla Sense of Snow,

266
0:24:45,200 --> 0:24:50,560
written by the Danish author Peter Hogue. And the main character is a Greenlander.

267
0:24:50,560 --> 0:24:55,520
And she presents this idea that a lot of people have heard where the Inuit have multiple words

268
0:24:55,520 --> 0:25:01,360
for snow. I think in this book, it's 23. The myth is that there are 50. And I think it's sort of

269
0:25:01,360 --> 0:25:05,360
an interesting discussion when we're talking about this early inflammatory phase and we talk

270
0:25:05,360 --> 0:25:13,360
about cytokine storms. Really, there's a lot of complexity here. And I think that you get the

271
0:25:13,360 --> 0:25:18,160
immunologist response. It's very complicated. But from a therapeutic point of view,

272
0:25:18,160 --> 0:25:24,160
we're still limited in what we do here. We still use steroids during this period. We still do

273
0:25:24,160 --> 0:25:30,240
oxygen. We still do medications to prevent people against cloth. So a lot of supportive care.

274
0:25:31,120 --> 0:25:36,160
Secondary infection phase. We're actually, I think I mentioned last time, but we're starting to see

275
0:25:36,160 --> 0:25:42,000
more issues here with resistant organisms because of sort of overuse of antibiotics early on. So

276
0:25:42,000 --> 0:25:46,880
let's really be careful sort of a reminder there to all our clinicians. If you see these people in

277
0:25:46,880 --> 0:25:53,120
the urgent care, you see people in the outpatient setting, what do you do? You might get them hooked

278
0:25:53,120 --> 0:25:57,840
up with a pulse oximeter. You might monitor them. You want to make that decision. Do they need to

279
0:25:57,840 --> 0:26:03,840
come in the hospital? You might consider aspirin, things like that. But no antibiotics is a viral

280
0:26:03,840 --> 0:26:08,880
illness. You want to be really careful. If you're giving more than 10% of your COVID patients

281
0:26:08,880 --> 0:26:14,240
antibiotics, you're overdoing it. Most patients can be managed at home without antibiotics

282
0:26:14,240 --> 0:26:20,320
with really not hospitalization in most cases. But if they do need to be in the hospital, if they

283
0:26:20,320 --> 0:26:25,600
get to this late phase, this is when we start seeing those infections. The multi-system

284
0:26:25,600 --> 0:26:31,360
inflammatory phase, it was like a deja vu back to April today. I don't know if that works right,

285
0:26:31,360 --> 0:26:39,520
but anyway, early on in April, we talked a bit about the Irish patients. I don't know if our

286
0:26:39,520 --> 0:26:44,960
listeners who are with us still remember that. Our Irish patient had an episode at one point

287
0:26:44,960 --> 0:26:49,760
where things seem to be going along really well. I'm thinking this is great. We come in and he's

288
0:26:49,760 --> 0:26:55,760
completely paralyzed. If our listeners remember that. Same thing happened over the last two days

289
0:26:55,760 --> 0:27:01,120
with one of my patients in the ICU. They're getting to the end of week four. We're starting to talk

290
0:27:01,120 --> 0:27:07,440
about discharge planning, getting this person set up with rehab, and completely paralyzed.

291
0:27:07,440 --> 0:27:12,800
And again, this is this Guillain-Barre syndrome that we see as part of this multi-system inflammatory

292
0:27:12,800 --> 0:27:18,400
phase. So that individual has been started on IVIG. It's a 5D treatment that we use.

293
0:27:19,280 --> 0:27:25,280
And the motor comes right back. So sort of a frightening thing. But I think now that we

294
0:27:25,280 --> 0:27:29,920
understand it, this sort of shows the difference in managing patients. Back we first saw this in

295
0:27:29,920 --> 0:27:34,160
April, we did not know what was going on. What's happening, this person was doing so well, suddenly

296
0:27:34,160 --> 0:27:38,720
they're paralyzed. And they're on a ventilator because they can't breathe on their own. But now

297
0:27:38,720 --> 0:27:44,800
we understand where this fits in. The tail phase, I'm going to finish off here because we've got a

298
0:27:44,800 --> 0:27:50,080
few emails. And my goal is to keep this all under 30 minutes. And I'm going to suggest that we

299
0:27:50,080 --> 0:27:55,760
create some kind of survey to decide what to call this tail phase. Now it's been recognized. Is it

300
0:27:55,760 --> 0:28:02,080
long COVID? Is it long haul trucker COVID? Is it long term COVID? Is it long lasting COVID?

301
0:28:02,080 --> 0:28:07,200
Is it post COVID? And actually, I'll let our listeners know that we're recording this on

302
0:28:07,200 --> 0:28:15,360
Thursday. But there is a large semi multi hour conference going on today Thursday and Friday,

303
0:28:15,360 --> 0:28:20,960
where a lot of clinicians, a lot of researchers are all having an NIH sponsored discussion,

304
0:28:20,960 --> 0:28:26,160
trying to better understand not only what's going on here, but how to put together research

305
0:28:26,160 --> 0:28:29,840
projects to try to get a better understanding of how to take care of some of these folks.

306
0:28:29,840 --> 0:28:36,560
So I'll stop there before we hit emails and just remind everyone that we have we have finished our

307
0:28:36,560 --> 0:28:43,760
microbe TV fundraiser, which went very well. I'm happy to say we're going to be able to

308
0:28:43,760 --> 0:28:49,760
generously support microbe TV, which is great. But we're we're now supporting the peace course,

309
0:28:49,760 --> 0:28:56,640
HIV and AIDS programs. Just remember that the other virus is still responsible for a lot of

310
0:28:56,640 --> 0:29:00,880
suffering and death throughout the world. So encourage people to go to parasites without borders.com.

311
0:29:00,880 --> 0:29:05,360
So we can do our matching support for the months of December and January.

312
0:29:06,080 --> 0:29:12,480
All right. So last time we made a new email address for Daniel Daniel at microbe.tv so you can send

313
0:29:13,520 --> 0:29:18,480
the emails there. And I, I save him the trouble of getting them. Actually, they come to me,

314
0:29:18,480 --> 0:29:22,480
but they're still for Daniel and we have a bunch. So let's do a couple.

315
0:29:22,480 --> 0:29:29,200
All right, I'm going to lump the first two together. Both Joy and Dennis are worried about

316
0:29:29,200 --> 0:29:35,600
long term COVID. They wanted, you know, they say they both have it. And what can be done? Are there

317
0:29:35,600 --> 0:29:42,800
any therapeutics in sight? And I've gotten this question many times, Daniel. So what can you tell

318
0:29:42,800 --> 0:29:48,560
us? Yeah, I mean, that was I think really encouraging about what what is going on today. What's going

319
0:29:48,560 --> 0:29:53,600
on tomorrow is that it is recognized that this is a phenomenon. It is recognized that these people

320
0:29:53,600 --> 0:29:59,360
are suffering and that we need to really bring science to bear. This can't be just, oh, try some

321
0:29:59,360 --> 0:30:04,480
mana histamine, see if the melatonin helps you sleep. We need to really get these people together.

322
0:30:04,480 --> 0:30:10,400
So a couple of things I will say is at United in research, I've mentioned that website before,

323
0:30:11,040 --> 0:30:17,920
we are going to basically create a COVID positive community. And we are going to basically give

324
0:30:17,920 --> 0:30:24,880
people a way to go on the web to register a citizen scientist and to basically participate in the

325
0:30:24,880 --> 0:30:30,720
different trials and the different approaches to how do we understand what's going on with people

326
0:30:30,720 --> 0:30:35,760
who continue to suffer from COVID. And we're going to be following serologies. There'll be

327
0:30:35,760 --> 0:30:40,880
questionnaires. There'll be all kinds of biomarker analysis. So it's going to be a lot of individuals

328
0:30:40,880 --> 0:30:45,440
looking at this. I will say at this point, we still have sort of primitive where we focus on

329
0:30:45,440 --> 0:30:51,680
symptoms, but this is going to be moving hopefully to better therapeutics. But there are thousands

330
0:30:51,680 --> 0:30:58,400
and hundreds of thousands of individuals suffering with this post COVID syndrome.

331
0:30:58,400 --> 0:31:04,720
And we're committed to finding answers. All right. Next one is from Chaim who lives in

332
0:31:04,720 --> 0:31:09,600
Washington, D.C. And he says, my kid's school is doing almost everything right, distancing,

333
0:31:09,600 --> 0:31:14,960
mask wearing, you know, no moving around, no testing, unfortunate. He says there's no testing

334
0:31:14,960 --> 0:31:22,080
as in addition to practical issues, they seem to be worried about moral hazard. Anyway, new cases

335
0:31:22,080 --> 0:31:26,960
are spiking here in D.C. We are now cresting the record set at the peak in May. Mayor has tightened

336
0:31:26,960 --> 0:31:32,880
some restrictions, but indoor dining still permitted. So I think things are going to get worse. His

337
0:31:32,880 --> 0:31:37,760
question, is there a point at which we should be pulling our son out of school? Obviously, I don't

338
0:31:37,760 --> 0:31:42,880
expect an exact threshold, but conceptually, does it make sense that at some point the background

339
0:31:42,880 --> 0:31:48,560
might get high enough to overwhelm the in school precautions? Or are the safety measures enough

340
0:31:48,560 --> 0:31:53,840
that we don't have to worry about community spread outside the school? Yeah, you know, I've always

341
0:31:53,840 --> 0:31:57,840
get questions about the schools. And I think that this is important. I'm going to be doing another

342
0:31:57,840 --> 0:32:02,160
talk for one of the schools this Sunday. And I think Shane Crotty is going to be like going

343
0:32:02,160 --> 0:32:10,640
before me, actually, so my buddy Shane Crotty. The science is mounting. The evidence is that you

344
0:32:10,640 --> 0:32:15,440
can make schools a safe place. That doesn't mean everyone's making it a safe place, but you can do

345
0:32:15,440 --> 0:32:21,280
it. So as you describe, if they put all these proper mitigation measures in place, if they,

346
0:32:21,280 --> 0:32:26,480
you know, keep the kids separated, if they wear masks, and watch that they're not indoor dining

347
0:32:26,480 --> 0:32:32,880
at school. And I really commend my son, who's always horrified that, you know, they sit too close

348
0:32:32,880 --> 0:32:38,800
when people eat. And that is true, Barnaby, you should be horrified like I am. We can make schools

349
0:32:38,800 --> 0:32:44,240
safe. The interesting thing is not only have I been weighing in and giving advice and sort of

350
0:32:44,240 --> 0:32:49,680
commenting on schools in the New York area, but actually throughout the country, my first involvement

351
0:32:49,680 --> 0:32:57,360
in schools was actually in March in Texas. And I still remember the conversation. So this was the

352
0:32:57,360 --> 0:33:03,200
superintendent of one of the largest school districts in Texas. And, you know, he asked me,

353
0:33:03,200 --> 0:33:09,280
and I've known him for a while. So he said, you know, Dan, you know, what do you think? Should we

354
0:33:09,280 --> 0:33:14,720
close the schools? And I said, you know what, you can either close them now, or you can wait until

355
0:33:14,720 --> 0:33:19,600
it's too late. And that was back. We didn't understand back in March, we didn't know that we could

356
0:33:19,600 --> 0:33:24,400
make schools a safe place. So this is a different scenario. And I don't think it's like, Oh, just

357
0:33:24,400 --> 0:33:28,640
in New York, you have resources can make the schools safe. I've talked to schools throughout

358
0:33:28,640 --> 0:33:35,680
the country, we can make schools safe in Idaho, in Texas, in Montana, in California, in Colorado.

359
0:33:36,880 --> 0:33:41,920
And and that's that's one of the things. So so I'll go ahead and say, I'm not sure closing schools

360
0:33:41,920 --> 0:33:47,120
makes a lot of sense, even here in New York City, where real estate and space is actually quite tough.

361
0:33:48,320 --> 0:33:53,520
The New York City mayor wants to open the schools again, and wants to do it in a way that they

362
0:33:53,520 --> 0:33:58,880
think is safe, because there are clear harms to closing the schools. And the teachers, you know,

363
0:33:58,880 --> 0:34:04,960
I'm thinking about teachers here too, they can be made safe. If if we do what we know works,

364
0:34:05,600 --> 0:34:09,920
if we don't give the masks, if we don't put measures in place, if we don't have the distancing,

365
0:34:09,920 --> 0:34:14,480
that's a problem. The other thing that is right around the corner, right, the rainbow at the end

366
0:34:14,480 --> 0:34:19,760
of this dark tunnel is right after we do the healthcare workers, we're going to start vaccinating

367
0:34:19,760 --> 0:34:25,280
the teachers. So in the in the coming months, the teachers are going to be safe as well. And I

368
0:34:25,280 --> 0:34:29,600
think that's really going to help us with opening schools. All right, one more from Paul, who is in

369
0:34:29,600 --> 0:34:37,840
Manchester UK. He sends a link to a BBC article about lung damage and wants to hear Dr. Griffin's

370
0:34:37,840 --> 0:34:44,320
thoughts. This is an article about a new scanning mechanism that has identified lung damage months

371
0:34:44,320 --> 0:34:52,240
after the initial infection. I think about this. Yeah, you know, I actually appreciate that you

372
0:34:52,240 --> 0:35:00,000
bring this up, Paul. You know, if anything, I think people underestimate the damage, the morbidity

373
0:35:00,000 --> 0:35:05,200
of COVID-19, you know, some less than wise people have sort of said, Oh, COVID either, you know,

374
0:35:05,200 --> 0:35:13,280
you get it and either live or you die. Yeah, no, most people who get COVID don't just live or die.

375
0:35:13,280 --> 0:35:18,880
A lot of the people that don't die are really negatively impacted. And we see the people with

376
0:35:18,880 --> 0:35:25,600
the long haul, the tale of COVID. But there's also a lot of individuals who were physically

377
0:35:25,600 --> 0:35:31,360
active and they find themselves compromised. We've had several several serious athletes who find

378
0:35:31,360 --> 0:35:35,120
that, you know, they went from running six, seven miles a day to having trouble going up the flight

379
0:35:35,120 --> 0:35:40,320
of stairs. We're appreciating that there can be for a lot of individuals much more lung damage

380
0:35:40,320 --> 0:35:46,720
than was initially appreciated. We're also recognizing heart damage as well. So I think these studies

381
0:35:46,720 --> 0:35:52,400
are really important to let people know that you really want to not get COVID. Because yeah,

382
0:35:52,400 --> 0:35:56,480
you may survive, you may come out the other side, you may be able to tell everyone how great you're

383
0:35:56,480 --> 0:36:01,760
doing. But let's see you try to run a mile after you've had COVID. It may not go so well. So

384
0:36:02,720 --> 0:36:08,800
let's really for the next few months until, and I guess this reminds me of my other movie as we'll

385
0:36:08,800 --> 0:36:13,440
sort of finish here soon. This was, I watched Greyhound. It always takes about a week because I

386
0:36:13,440 --> 0:36:19,280
watch in like seven minute increments. But this is a World War II and it's a shipping convoy and

387
0:36:19,280 --> 0:36:24,320
they've they've left the safety of air cover of the US. And now they're heading towards air cover

388
0:36:24,320 --> 0:36:28,880
over in England. You know, and they're how many hours till we're back in air cover. And that's

389
0:36:28,880 --> 0:36:34,960
where we are right now. It's only weeks and months till we've got the air cover of the vaccine. So,

390
0:36:34,960 --> 0:36:39,840
you know, let's just be safe. Let's zigzag. Let's let's avoid those crowds. Let's wear those masks.

391
0:36:39,840 --> 0:36:46,560
Let's wash our hands so we can get back to the air cover of the vaccine and the pre COVID world.

392
0:36:47,920 --> 0:36:55,360
All right. That's our COVID-19 clinical update number 39 from Dr. Daniel Griffin. Thank you, Daniel.

393
0:36:55,360 --> 0:37:10,240
Oh, pleasure. It's always and everyone be safe.
