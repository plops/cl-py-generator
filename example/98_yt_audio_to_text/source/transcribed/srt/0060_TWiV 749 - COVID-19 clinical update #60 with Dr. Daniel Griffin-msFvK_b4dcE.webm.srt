This week in virology, the podcast about viruses, the kind that make you sick.

2
0:00:10,400 --> 0:00:22,080
From Microbe TV, this is Twiv, this week in virology, episode 749 recorded on April 29, 2021.

3
0:00:22,720 --> 0:00:28,640
I'm Vincent Rackeniello, and you're listening to the podcast all about viruses. Joining me

4
0:00:28,640 --> 0:00:36,080
today from New York, Daniel Griffin. Hello, everyone. How's this week been Daniel?

5
0:00:37,680 --> 0:00:41,280
Things are getting a little bit better, to be honest, at least here in New York.

6
0:00:42,240 --> 0:00:47,360
It's a little painful when I look at how things are going in the world, but let's get right into

7
0:00:47,360 --> 0:00:54,080
it, because our quotation ties this together. There are two kinds of guilt, the kind that

8
0:00:54,080 --> 0:01:00,240
drowns you until you're useless, and the kind that fires your soul to purpose. This is by

9
0:01:00,800 --> 0:01:07,760
Sabah Tahir, a Pakistani American author. Right into that question, Vincent, that you asked me,

10
0:01:07,760 --> 0:01:13,040
how are things going? Here in the United States, and most of the United States, we've really started

11
0:01:13,040 --> 0:01:19,760
to come off of that plateau. Numbers are going down. We look at the numbers of patients in the

12
0:01:19,760 --> 0:01:25,600
hospitals here in the New York state, and it's about 60 percent lower than it was a month ago,

13
0:01:25,600 --> 0:01:32,640
so that's really coming down. It's often several days that I go without a patient with COVID

14
0:01:32,640 --> 0:01:39,120
dying, actually. This is really changing the landscape. We are not where we were in April of

15
0:01:39,120 --> 0:01:46,160
2020. We're in April of 2021, and it was just announced that July 1, New York City is going to

16
0:01:46,160 --> 0:01:55,040
be full open 100 percent across the board. I think that we are seeing that vaccines are not

17
0:01:55,040 --> 0:01:59,680
just tooled. They're the nuclear option. They really are our game changer, and we'll be talking

18
0:01:59,680 --> 0:02:07,040
a little bit about that today. Things are not going well around the world. Around the world,

19
0:02:07,040 --> 0:02:13,280
the cases are rising, the deaths are rising. We are still really in the middle of the pandemic.

20
0:02:13,280 --> 0:02:19,760
This is why I sort of use this quotation as exciting as it is here in the US. I know

21
0:02:19,760 --> 0:02:24,960
personally I feel a sort of sense of guilt, seeing how much other people are suffering,

22
0:02:26,160 --> 0:02:30,560
and not wanting to say, let that make you feel useless. Let's all be asking ourselves,

23
0:02:30,560 --> 0:02:35,600
what can we do to reach out now to the rest of the world now that I think we're really on our own

24
0:02:35,600 --> 0:02:43,760
path here? Children and COVID. I mentioned, I promised last time that I would spend some time

25
0:02:44,480 --> 0:02:49,520
talking about camp guidance, and we now have the CDC updated guidance for operating

26
0:02:49,520 --> 0:02:59,120
youth and summer camps during COVID-19. You can Google away CDC, summer camp, and get this

27
0:02:59,120 --> 0:03:06,640
really informative resource here. When I was younger, people don't know that I was once younger,

28
0:03:06,640 --> 0:03:11,840
I was. My middle daughter, Eloise, actually, I think looks a bit like I did when I was younger,

29
0:03:11,840 --> 0:03:18,160
except she's a lot better looking than I ever was. I used to work as a camp counselor at Camp

30
0:03:18,160 --> 0:03:25,360
Jabberwocky. This was a camp out on one of the islands off the coast of Massachusetts for children

31
0:03:25,360 --> 0:03:33,280
with cerebral palsy, spina bifida, down syndrome, other challenges. I look back on the time that

32
0:03:33,280 --> 0:03:40,080
I spent there, and I think if we all take a moment, we realize how important camp is for so many

33
0:03:40,080 --> 0:03:44,960
reasons, for so many different individuals, and to take an expression of my dad who says,

34
0:03:44,960 --> 0:03:50,480
every vacation you don't take is a vacation you'll never take. Every summer, our kids don't have

35
0:03:50,480 --> 0:03:56,480
an opportunity to go to summer camp. That's gone. That summer camp opportunity is gone. I've been

36
0:03:56,480 --> 0:04:02,400
doing quite a bit pro bono work. I think I'm starting to push it with my wife. She's starting to say,

37
0:04:02,400 --> 0:04:08,320
I need to stop doing so much of that. But I really think that this is a critical area, and so I've

38
0:04:08,320 --> 0:04:14,400
been trying to do my part to help with a number of camps get set up for summer. But let's go through

39
0:04:14,400 --> 0:04:19,760
what is the CDC telling us, and what can we think about for the summer for our children, for our

40
0:04:19,760 --> 0:04:26,000
grandchildren, depending on where we are in life. So the CDC states that fewer children have gotten

41
0:04:26,000 --> 0:04:31,920
sick with COVID-19 compared with adults during the pandemic. Children can be infected with the

42
0:04:31,920 --> 0:04:38,400
virus that causes COVID-19. That's SARS-CoV-2. They can get sick with COVID-19. They can spread

43
0:04:38,400 --> 0:04:43,840
the virus to others, and they can have severe outcomes. Now, I think this is an important

44
0:04:43,840 --> 0:04:50,240
starting point. Children are at lower risk, but they are not at no risk. The CDC has a lot of

45
0:04:50,240 --> 0:04:54,720
recommendations about how we are keeping our kids safe or how we can keep our kids safe.

46
0:04:54,720 --> 0:05:01,840
They recommend that each camp have an emergency operations plan in place to protect the staff,

47
0:05:02,400 --> 0:05:08,080
to protect the campers, the families, and then the communities. Remember, these camps operate in

48
0:05:08,080 --> 0:05:13,200
areas which are often not as heavily populated as other parts. So if you bring COVID into these

49
0:05:13,200 --> 0:05:17,200
areas, you're not just exposing the kids and everyone else, you're exposing the community.

50
0:05:17,200 --> 0:05:24,320
There should be some minimum features in these plans. A lot of the camps, I have to say, are getting

51
0:05:24,320 --> 0:05:29,440
these plans up. A lot of them are actually fully in place because probably expecting money from

52
0:05:29,440 --> 0:05:33,280
the parents at this point. So they want to be able to have meetings. Actually, we had one last night

53
0:05:33,280 --> 0:05:39,440
when Tila, well, after eight o'clock. First, we met ahead of time to go over our plans,

54
0:05:39,440 --> 0:05:44,880
and then we spent over an hour with the parents answering questions. And so what are the topics

55
0:05:44,880 --> 0:05:51,280
that should be in this emergency plan? One, and this is number one, the CDC is saying,

56
0:05:51,280 --> 0:05:57,840
number one, strongly encourage vaccination for all eligible people. As I mentioned, this is a

57
0:05:57,840 --> 0:06:04,800
game changer. We are seeing that the vaccines are more effective in real life than even we were

58
0:06:04,800 --> 0:06:12,880
hoping when we saw the initial exciting studies. The other health screening for symptoms and

59
0:06:13,440 --> 0:06:19,600
diagnostic or screening testing. So testing should be a part of the plan. That's number two right

60
0:06:19,600 --> 0:06:26,800
after vaccine testing. And maybe we'll get into this a little more, but the government is working

61
0:06:26,800 --> 0:06:34,800
with the states and providing testing opportunities for the camps, actually supplying testing in that

62
0:06:34,800 --> 0:06:41,040
huge $2 trillion bill that went through, use multiple layers prevention strategies. So

63
0:06:41,040 --> 0:06:44,960
we're still going to see masking in certain situations. We're still going to see physical

64
0:06:44,960 --> 0:06:49,920
distancing. We're going to see cohorting and cohorting is a nice way to break this down

65
0:06:49,920 --> 0:06:55,760
so that if there is an issue, it's not the entire camp. You're keeping it, you're keeping it sort

66
0:06:55,760 --> 0:07:01,840
of contained. And then also a focus on the housing arrangements. And, and I think it's great,

67
0:07:01,840 --> 0:07:07,440
right up front, improved ventilation. I think we've been trying to talk about the fact that,

68
0:07:07,440 --> 0:07:12,000
you know, even though this is a respiratory droplet spread or respiratory virus,

69
0:07:12,000 --> 0:07:16,960
if you take an indoor space, if you don't have ventilation, you start building up,

70
0:07:16,960 --> 0:07:21,840
you start building up that six feet away is not going to protect you in an area with poor ventilation.

71
0:07:21,840 --> 0:07:28,000
Think about kids sleeping together in these cabins with their staff. They also want you to start

72
0:07:28,000 --> 0:07:34,000
thinking about the fact that not everyone's risk is the same. So think about campers and staff

73
0:07:34,000 --> 0:07:41,280
that might have higher risks. Really a big push to promote outdoors. I kind of like this,

74
0:07:41,280 --> 0:07:46,400
spending about 20 years of my life out in Colorado to see that, you know, the CDC now is recommending,

75
0:07:46,400 --> 0:07:53,360
you know, promoting outdoor and lower risk activities. So, you know, I know people love

76
0:07:53,360 --> 0:07:58,800
that that's singing in the mess hall. Let's get that singing outdoors. Traveling to and from,

77
0:07:58,800 --> 0:08:03,040
you want to be thinking about that, you don't want to be creating exposure events on the way

78
0:08:03,040 --> 0:08:07,920
to the camp. You also want to think about on the way off cleaning. They mentioned, right,

79
0:08:07,920 --> 0:08:11,680
we're getting sort of down here. Remember, cleaning was number one in the olden days,

80
0:08:11,680 --> 0:08:17,280
we're realizing this is not, this is something you get by breathing, not necessarily touching,

81
0:08:17,280 --> 0:08:22,880
washing those hands. And then they go on to basically go through a lot of other things,

82
0:08:22,880 --> 0:08:29,520
including where they finish with, have a plan in case someone gets COVID-19, have a plan

83
0:08:30,240 --> 0:08:35,440
in case someone tests positive. And there's two sides, I'm going to say, if you get a positive

84
0:08:35,440 --> 0:08:40,160
test, if you're doing a lot of testing, you're going to get false positive. So have a plan,

85
0:08:40,160 --> 0:08:45,840
how do I quickly verify to see if this is true? How do I respond to those? So we're getting

86
0:08:45,840 --> 0:08:51,760
great guidance here from the CDC on how to do this safely. We will have a layer where the states

87
0:08:51,760 --> 0:08:56,640
are going to have individual guidance and actually mandates for how camps are going to operate.

88
0:08:56,640 --> 0:09:00,800
They're going to give us specific numbers on if you're cohorting how big of those cohorts

89
0:09:00,800 --> 0:09:05,920
allowed to be, what should be the ratio. So I think that's going to help here. But I think the

90
0:09:05,920 --> 0:09:11,920
message here is that we can do this safely. Again, just like the schools, it can also be done

91
0:09:11,920 --> 0:09:18,480
unsafely. So ask, ask your camp, what are your plans? Are you planning on following CDC guidance?

92
0:09:18,480 --> 0:09:22,880
Are you planning on keeping my kids safe? Because as I keep re-array,

93
0:09:22,880 --> 0:09:28,160
children are certainly at lower risk, but they're not at no risk. Pre-exposure period,

94
0:09:28,880 --> 0:09:34,640
this has been an exciting week. CDC has really been out there this week. And on April 27,

95
0:09:34,640 --> 0:09:40,640
the CDC came out with it. When you've been fully vaccinated, how to protect yourself and others

96
0:09:40,640 --> 0:09:45,280
guidance. And I'm actually going to be, well, I think by the time this drops, I'll already talked

97
0:09:45,280 --> 0:09:52,000
about this on the news, this fear of normal. How do we get back to normal and how can this happen?

98
0:09:52,800 --> 0:09:59,600
So what did the CDC have to say? The first, let's define what does it mean as per the CDC

99
0:09:59,600 --> 0:10:02,960
to be fully vaccinated? And they're using, just to keep it simple,

100
0:10:02,960 --> 0:10:08,400
two weeks. They're saying two weeks after you finish your vaccine. So two weeks after you did

101
0:10:08,400 --> 0:10:14,720
that, two dose Moderna Pfizer, two weeks after your J&J. People have probably known, I kind of

102
0:10:14,720 --> 0:10:20,400
like four weeks after the J&J, but I won't break rags with the CDC on this one. But this is not

103
0:10:20,400 --> 0:10:25,600
the day. This is not the night of your vaccine. Vaccines take a little time. So take that time,

104
0:10:26,240 --> 0:10:31,840
let your body build up those T cells, those B cells, that immune protection. And then,

105
0:10:31,840 --> 0:10:38,320
what can you do if you're fully vaccinated? As per the CDC, they're saying you can gather indoors

106
0:10:38,880 --> 0:10:44,240
with fully vaccinated people without wearing a mask. That's pretty exciting.

107
0:10:45,440 --> 0:10:51,520
You can gather indoors with unvaccinated people. And they're saying without masks,

108
0:10:51,520 --> 0:10:57,360
they're talking about staying six feet apart. And they're also throwing in here, you want to be

109
0:10:57,360 --> 0:11:02,400
careful if there's someone there who has increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19. Then,

110
0:11:02,400 --> 0:11:07,680
and I like this part, you can gather or conduct activities outdoors without wearing a mask,

111
0:11:08,480 --> 0:11:14,560
except in certain crowded settings and venues. So really doubling down on what we've learned.

112
0:11:15,280 --> 0:11:21,680
If you are vaccinated, you are at much lower risk. If you're outdoors, that risk is about 20

113
0:11:21,680 --> 0:11:29,280
fold higher than indoors. So we're starting to see things coming back. If you travel in the United

114
0:11:29,280 --> 0:11:34,960
States, as per the CDC, you do not need to get tested before or after travel or self quarantine.

115
0:11:34,960 --> 0:11:40,720
Remember, this is for the fully vaccinated. They do make some comments about international travel.

116
0:11:41,440 --> 0:11:46,240
Really, the US isn't going to put a lot of onus on you. You're going to be needing to look at what

117
0:11:46,240 --> 0:11:53,440
international destination you might be traveling to. What should you keep doing for now if you're

118
0:11:53,440 --> 0:11:59,520
fully vaccinated, right? I think there was a wonderful beer commercial where the guy is all

119
0:11:59,520 --> 0:12:04,080
excited. He's getting his vaccine and then he's going to go to the bar and do all these other

120
0:12:04,080 --> 0:12:09,440
things. Well, what do they want you to keep doing? They say you should still protect yourself and

121
0:12:09,440 --> 0:12:16,400
others in many situations by wearing a mask that fits snuggly. So let's say you're indoor,

122
0:12:17,280 --> 0:12:23,520
public setting. There's a large number of people. There's going to be unvaccinated people,

123
0:12:23,520 --> 0:12:29,360
including children, they point out from multiple households. So you're really still you're still

124
0:12:29,360 --> 0:12:35,120
going to be wearing your mask in certain circumstances. You're visiting indoors with an unvaccinated

125
0:12:35,120 --> 0:12:40,720
individual who's at increased risk. We're saying, boy, vaccination really makes you

126
0:12:40,720 --> 0:12:46,320
much lower risk of transmitting to others. It does not make you no risk. And in this case,

127
0:12:46,320 --> 0:12:53,360
if the stakes are high, they say you should still be avoiding those indoor, large gatherings. You

128
0:12:53,360 --> 0:12:58,480
you don't want to go to that packed facility yet. At some point, maybe that will come.

129
0:12:58,480 --> 0:13:05,520
And also, as we know, they still have a mask requirement if you travel. So even if you're fully

130
0:13:05,520 --> 0:13:10,560
vaccinated, you're still required to wear a mask when you're on a plane, on a bus, on a train,

131
0:13:11,360 --> 0:13:18,080
other other public transportation. They still want you to watch out for symptoms. As we've seen,

132
0:13:18,080 --> 0:13:24,720
we do see breakthrough symptoms. Fully vaccinated people can still get COVID-19.

133
0:13:24,720 --> 0:13:28,800
So if you have symptoms, you're still going to go. Don't stop testing. You're still going to go

134
0:13:28,800 --> 0:13:33,200
get tested. And so I encourage everyone to go to the CDC site really look through this.

135
0:13:34,080 --> 0:13:38,000
For some people, it's going to take a little time. I think other people just jump in the deep

136
0:13:38,000 --> 0:13:44,080
end of the pool and they're good to go. I for one, I will mention I have a little trepidation. I

137
0:13:44,080 --> 0:13:49,120
still have a fear of normal. It's going to take me a little time to ease back into things even

138
0:13:49,120 --> 0:13:55,120
though I am fully vaccinated. Transmission. I always like to have a section where I push people's

139
0:13:55,120 --> 0:14:02,400
buttons and get some criticism. So this will be it. In many ways, I think going through the camp

140
0:14:02,400 --> 0:14:08,320
and the vaccinated guidance really helps us to answer a lot of the questions about transmission.

141
0:14:08,320 --> 0:14:14,160
People are not, I think, as focused on the words as they are in really understanding

142
0:14:14,160 --> 0:14:19,840
different circumstances and how to behave and how to be safe in those situations.

143
0:14:20,560 --> 0:14:25,520
And I actually step out here and say, I think there was a disservice done early on

144
0:14:25,520 --> 0:14:32,640
with the whole, is it airborne discussion? And perhaps the immortal words of Roxanne Comse,

145
0:14:32,640 --> 0:14:36,400
maybe these will now become immortal. A headline of one of her pieces,

146
0:14:36,400 --> 0:14:42,160
they say coronavirus isn't airborne, but it's definitely borne by air. The word airborne means

147
0:14:42,160 --> 0:14:45,760
different things to different scientists and that confusion needs to be addressed.

148
0:14:46,800 --> 0:14:52,960
Just I always like to sort of bring this back around again. Surfaces are low risk. Remember,

149
0:14:52,960 --> 0:15:00,240
lots of hygiene theater, way too much bleach. Maybe one in every 10,000 cases came from surfaces.

150
0:15:00,880 --> 0:15:08,400
Outdoors much safer than indoors. About 20-fold safer. Masks are effective for the wearer and

151
0:15:08,400 --> 0:15:16,080
those around us. Air exchange is critical for indoor risk. Time matters and it is cumulative

152
0:15:16,080 --> 0:15:21,280
for exposures. Vaccines are not just tools, as we're seeing. They are really the nuclear option for

153
0:15:21,280 --> 0:15:26,080
ending the pandemic. And once people are fully vaccinated, once we get a larger percentage

154
0:15:26,080 --> 0:15:31,680
of our population fully vaccinated, things do change. Things do really change in a positive way.

155
0:15:31,680 --> 0:15:40,000
All right, testing. Never miss an opportunity to test. As we talked about the camps, as you saw,

156
0:15:40,000 --> 0:15:46,560
number two right after vaccination was testing. So I want to keep reinforcing. We've seen a lot

157
0:15:46,560 --> 0:15:53,920
of publications on this. I had one out there with some of my colleagues at UHG. And testing

158
0:15:53,920 --> 0:16:00,320
is a critical part of this multi-layered approach to opening camps, schools, businesses, and other

159
0:16:00,320 --> 0:16:06,400
venues. We should be doing more not less testing. We are doing less testing, to be honest. The data

160
0:16:06,400 --> 0:16:12,400
is really compelling here. And one of the things that is compelling is we want more frequent,

161
0:16:12,400 --> 0:16:17,600
so frequent testing. Rapid results. We want to avoid those resulting delays.

162
0:16:18,480 --> 0:16:26,240
Test with testing, more is better. All right, active vaccination. This has been a busy area.

163
0:16:26,240 --> 0:16:31,600
Never miss an opportunity to vaccinate and never waste a vaccine dose. We're starting to get to

164
0:16:31,600 --> 0:16:36,640
the point here in the U.S. It's like throwing away food, right? Don't throw that dose in the

165
0:16:36,640 --> 0:16:41,520
trash. Let's get it in someone's arm. We've definitely shifted here in the U.S. And I'm seeing

166
0:16:41,520 --> 0:16:47,360
this firsthand from arms searching for vaccines to vaccines searching for arms.

167
0:16:47,360 --> 0:16:55,120
Since we last talked, actually, this dropped after the meeting. But what happened with the

168
0:16:55,120 --> 0:17:02,160
J&J vaccine? There was a meeting Friday, April 23rd. I asked my partners to cover so I could

169
0:17:02,160 --> 0:17:07,120
listen to this. That just raises my geek factor, I guess, that I wanted to listen to this all day.

170
0:17:08,400 --> 0:17:16,960
But a summary came out. So we saw published April 27th in the MMWR updated recommendations

171
0:17:16,960 --> 0:17:22,480
from the advisory committee on immunization practices for the use of the Janssen Johnson

172
0:17:22,480 --> 0:17:29,280
and Johnson COVID-19 vaccine after ports of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome

173
0:17:29,280 --> 0:17:36,000
among vaccine recipients United States April 2021. So in brief, the advisory committee on

174
0:17:36,000 --> 0:17:42,320
immunization practices concluded that the risks of resuming Janssen COVID-19 vaccination among

175
0:17:42,320 --> 0:17:49,360
persons aged equal to or greater than 18 outweighed the risks and reaffirmed its interim recommendation

176
0:17:49,360 --> 0:17:56,240
under the FDA's emergency use authorization, but included a new warning for rare clotting

177
0:17:56,240 --> 0:18:04,800
events among women aged 18 to 49 for this thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome or TTS,

178
0:18:04,800 --> 0:18:09,600
as we'll be referring to it, or as other people refer to it as VITS vaccine induced

179
0:18:09,600 --> 0:18:15,760
thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome. So what did we know? What did we learn from this

180
0:18:15,760 --> 0:18:23,600
publication and from the meeting? Nearly 8 million. So 7.98 million doses of the Janssen COVID-19

181
0:18:23,600 --> 0:18:30,240
vaccine had been administered in the United States and the vaccine adverse event reporting

182
0:18:30,240 --> 0:18:39,200
system. So VAERS received at the end of this prior to this meeting 15 reports of the TTS after

183
0:18:39,200 --> 0:18:45,840
vaccinations. With the clots located, I think this is important in the cerebral venous sinuses

184
0:18:45,840 --> 0:18:52,240
and other unusual locations, including the portal vein, the splenic vein, and a combination of

185
0:18:52,240 --> 0:18:59,760
venous and arterial thrombosis. These 15 reports were confirmed by physician reviewers at the CDC

186
0:18:59,760 --> 0:19:05,520
and the FDA. They went through and reviewed this, including having hematologists involved in the

187
0:19:05,520 --> 0:19:13,760
review. 13 of the cases occurred among women aged 18 to 49. Two occurred among women aged

188
0:19:14,720 --> 0:19:20,640
50 or older. And no cases post authorization reported among men. Remember, there was a man

189
0:19:20,640 --> 0:19:29,680
in the trial, but he was not in this 15 person study here. So the TTS reporting rates were

190
0:19:29,680 --> 0:19:37,280
7 cases per million. And the Janssen COVID-19 vaccines were administered to the 18 to 49.

191
0:19:37,280 --> 0:19:43,040
We had 0.9 per million in the aged greater than 50 years. And then they broke it down into

192
0:19:43,040 --> 0:19:47,120
different subgroups, which I'll go through actually. And what I'm going to do here is I'm going to

193
0:19:47,120 --> 0:19:52,720
jump to, I'm going to give John hit some credit here. John hit at United Health Group actually

194
0:19:52,720 --> 0:19:58,640
made some tables for me. Wasn't really for me there for the whole group, our sort of national

195
0:19:58,640 --> 0:20:06,160
vaccine advisory panel. But what were the race? What were the cases of TTS per million vaccinations

196
0:20:06,160 --> 0:20:13,600
broken down by age, right? So all age groups, 1.87. If you looked at people under 50, it was 7

197
0:20:13,600 --> 0:20:19,440
per million, over 50, it was 0.9. And then you can break it down into other age groups as well.

198
0:20:20,000 --> 0:20:25,520
Then there was the other and this came up where there are certain comorbid conditions or maybe

199
0:20:25,520 --> 0:20:32,800
certain medications that we should be thinking about. What about obesity? 7 of the 12 had obesity,

200
0:20:32,800 --> 0:20:42,000
8 did not. What about oral contraception? 13 were not, hypothyroid to hypertension to

201
0:20:42,640 --> 0:20:48,240
no recent pregnancies. Interesting enough, no history of prior clotting disorders in this

202
0:20:48,240 --> 0:20:54,240
population. So at the end of the report, and I'm going to sort of even make some comments here,

203
0:20:54,240 --> 0:20:58,160
they basically went ahead and they said, okay, we are going to put this back out there.

204
0:20:58,160 --> 0:21:02,640
We're going to put a warning on there and we're going to allow this to be a patient decision

205
0:21:02,640 --> 0:21:07,360
ultimately. And I have to admit, when I've talked to a lot of physicians about this,

206
0:21:07,360 --> 0:21:13,280
not all of them were as excited as I should say I was. And I think this is interesting, right?

207
0:21:14,080 --> 0:21:20,480
Physicians like to be the ones who get to make decisions. And so here, we're basically saying

208
0:21:20,480 --> 0:21:25,920
no, the patient will get the right certain physicians say I would feel better if we did not use this

209
0:21:25,920 --> 0:21:32,320
vaccine in women under the age of 50. And I think that really take it as it is. They are saying

210
0:21:32,320 --> 0:21:36,960
that's not the physician's decision. Here are the facts, it's the patient's decision. And we're

211
0:21:36,960 --> 0:21:41,600
actually maybe starting to move into a realm where before we said take whatever vaccine you have

212
0:21:41,600 --> 0:21:46,400
the opportunity to take. Now we're starting to see patients have preferences based on certain

213
0:21:46,400 --> 0:21:53,280
things patient the other day. This was a woman in her 40s. She had a prior history of a pulmonary

214
0:21:53,280 --> 0:21:58,080
embolism. We had a discussion and she was suggested to me that she would prefer to do a

215
0:21:58,080 --> 0:22:04,400
Moderna over the J and J vaccine. I think that that's completely reasonable. If we're looking at

216
0:22:04,400 --> 0:22:10,000
challenges with getting more vaccine uptake, giving people choice, letting them have agency,

217
0:22:10,000 --> 0:22:14,640
I think that that's more important than physicians getting to have the final say on everything here.

218
0:22:14,640 --> 0:22:19,040
We continue to have our vaccines against the variants race or what I like to call

219
0:22:19,040 --> 0:22:23,360
vaccines against the variants of concern as well as behaviors of concern.

220
0:22:24,240 --> 0:22:29,840
And we actually got to what I think are encouraging preprints that became available about the New

221
0:22:29,840 --> 0:22:39,840
York variant. It's nice that we have our own variant. B1526 SARS-CoV-2 variant identified in New York

222
0:22:39,840 --> 0:22:46,160
City neutralized by vaccine elicited and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. And that

223
0:22:46,160 --> 0:22:54,480
was available as a preprint. We also had detection and characterization of the SARS-CoV-2 lineage,

224
0:22:54,480 --> 0:23:02,240
B1526 in New York. Now basically both papers demonstrated that vaccine serum showed a little

225
0:23:02,240 --> 0:23:08,880
bit of a decrease, but remained at an elevated and protective level. Convalescent plasma did not

226
0:23:08,880 --> 0:23:14,960
fare as well. The monoclonal cocktail by Regeneron continued to be effective. I think the take home

227
0:23:14,960 --> 0:23:22,320
message here was that the vaccine still work against the variants. Don't count on protection

228
0:23:22,320 --> 0:23:27,360
after natural infection quite as much as counting on the protection that we get with vaccination.

229
0:23:28,560 --> 0:23:33,200
All right, the period of detectable viral replication, right, you test positive.

230
0:23:33,200 --> 0:23:41,840
This is the time for monitoring and monoclonals so far. I think it's important that although this

231
0:23:41,840 --> 0:23:48,880
may not impact our daily clinician as physicians, we do pay attention to what's happening around

232
0:23:48,880 --> 0:23:53,280
the world. Maybe it will swing back. Maybe it will affect us, but I think it's also important for

233
0:23:53,280 --> 0:24:01,760
us to be aware of what's going on. So there was an article, the global case fatality rate of COVID-19

234
0:24:01,760 --> 0:24:07,760
has been declining since May 2020 published in the American Society of Tropical Medicine and

235
0:24:07,760 --> 0:24:15,680
Hygiene Journal. So what's happening here? So the authors collected daily COVID-19 diagnoses

236
0:24:15,680 --> 0:24:23,040
and mortality data from the WHO's daily situation reports and reported that based on this data,

237
0:24:23,040 --> 0:24:32,080
the weekly global cumulative COVID-19 reported case fatality rate. So that's that R-CFR. I feel

238
0:24:32,080 --> 0:24:37,760
like we're going back when we were first learning about the difference between case fatality rate

239
0:24:37,760 --> 0:24:44,560
and reported case fatality rate. So these are cases reported. We have documented that this is

240
0:24:44,560 --> 0:24:51,360
COVID-19. What percent of those individuals die? We know that the actual case fatality rate is

241
0:24:51,360 --> 0:24:58,000
probably higher, where the actual infection fatality rate is probably higher. But we reached a peak of

242
0:24:58,000 --> 0:25:07,280
7.23% in the last week of April, April 22 to 28 in 2020, right? So it's right about a year ago.

243
0:25:07,280 --> 0:25:15,520
This was followed by a strong declining trend up until the 53rd week post peak right after this peak.

244
0:25:15,520 --> 0:25:24,880
We ended up down at 2.2% in the last week of December 2020. Now why did this happen? And they had a

245
0:25:24,880 --> 0:25:31,760
couple suggestions, right? So that's the data. They suggested that part of this was an increased rate

246
0:25:31,760 --> 0:25:37,280
of infection in younger individuals, right? We know the younger individuals have a lower case

247
0:25:37,280 --> 0:25:46,640
fatality rate. They also looked at a map of regional reported case fatality rates. So Yemen,

248
0:25:46,640 --> 0:25:51,840
for instance, where I believe Dixon likes to go salmon fishing, they had a reported case fatality

249
0:25:51,840 --> 0:26:00,240
rate of 30% April through December of 2020, while by comparison, the reported case fatality rate

250
0:26:00,240 --> 0:26:06,480
overall in the US is 2% for all cases with an outcome. So I recommend people take a look.

251
0:26:06,480 --> 0:26:10,240
It's worth looking at the different figures and seeing what's happened over time.

252
0:26:10,240 --> 0:26:15,280
I keep saying this is the time for monitoring and monoclonals, but I am hoping that this will

253
0:26:15,280 --> 0:26:21,440
change. We keep hearing from Pfizer that by the end of the year, they're promising us an oral

254
0:26:21,440 --> 0:26:29,280
COVID pill. Now, what do we know about this? They're talking about a phase one study of a very catchy

255
0:26:29,280 --> 0:26:38,800
PF07321332. So what is this? And what do we know? A little background here. So SARS-CoV-2

256
0:26:39,360 --> 0:26:46,160
produces two large viral poly proteins. These are really long proteins that are going to need to

257
0:26:46,160 --> 0:26:55,680
be chopped up. So PP1A and PP1AB. And these are processed by two virally encoded cysteine proteases.

258
0:26:55,680 --> 0:27:06,000
Now, the main protease is also called 3C-like protease. So 3CL protease or 3CL-pro, and there's

259
0:27:06,000 --> 0:27:13,680
a papain-like protease. So we initially heard about this product, or targeting this, with an

260
0:27:13,680 --> 0:27:21,680
intravenous preparation. It was PF00835231. It'll be a test at the end. This was a pre-print

261
0:27:21,680 --> 0:27:28,240
back in February, entitled Discovery of a Novel Inhibitor of Coronavirus 3CL protease

262
0:27:28,240 --> 0:27:34,000
for the potential treatment of COVID-19. And now Pfizer is suggesting that they'll have the other

263
0:27:34,000 --> 0:27:42,160
catchy PF07321332. On the market by the end of this year, they have started a phase one trial,

264
0:27:42,160 --> 0:27:49,760
right? So that's hopefully we're going to have more tools. We also have been hearing from Merck

265
0:27:49,760 --> 0:27:57,680
and Ridgeback Biopharmaceuticals that they've been working on malnupiravir. And this is a different

266
0:27:57,680 --> 0:28:04,880
way, a different small molecule potential oral pill that can be used as an antiviral. This is a

267
0:28:04,880 --> 0:28:12,160
ribonucleoside analog that they have found inhibits replication of multiple RNA viruses. This is

268
0:28:12,160 --> 0:28:17,920
something they've been working with for a while. People who are familiar with HIV and age treatment

269
0:28:17,920 --> 0:28:25,600
think of this much like AZT, where you're getting one of those building blocks of the RNA. So an A,

270
0:28:25,600 --> 0:28:31,520
a C, a G, or a U, we target all these in HIV, and you replace one of these with an analog,

271
0:28:31,520 --> 0:28:37,920
which then gets brought in and interferes with the virus replication. As we find out more about

272
0:28:37,920 --> 0:28:43,120
this, I will certainly share that information. All right, so let us finish off here with the

273
0:28:43,120 --> 0:28:49,680
tail phase long COVID or post COVID. And I think I'm going to call this it is not just about long

274
0:28:49,680 --> 0:28:56,160
COVID. So early on, I fought against this narrow view, what people thought about COVID, the you're

275
0:28:56,160 --> 0:29:01,520
either going to live or you die. And that's the end of it. Still, still unfortunately here to this

276
0:29:01,520 --> 0:29:07,040
day from positions, just sort of this idea that people who are suffering, oh, it's all in their head.

277
0:29:07,040 --> 0:29:13,760
But I think people are now appreciating, many more people are appreciating that it can be a lot

278
0:29:13,760 --> 0:29:20,080
more than two weeks once COVID gets into your system, so to speak. But there's also an appreciation

279
0:29:20,080 --> 0:29:24,960
that maybe there's something more than even just long COVID. I think this is a little discouraging,

280
0:29:24,960 --> 0:29:33,440
but in nature, there was the article, high dimensional characterization of post acute sequelae of COVID-19.

281
0:29:33,440 --> 0:29:40,240
Now, what is this about? So the authors in this article used the national health care databases

282
0:29:40,240 --> 0:29:46,320
of the US departments of Veterans Affairs to systematically and comprehensively identify

283
0:29:46,320 --> 0:29:53,680
six month incidents sequelae, including diagnoses, medication use, laboratory abnormalities in

284
0:29:53,680 --> 0:30:02,560
30 day survivors of COVID-19. All right, so this is a really robust database. This cohort was five

285
0:30:02,560 --> 0:30:10,320
million eight hundred and eight thousand zero one eight participants. And so this, this is a really

286
0:30:10,320 --> 0:30:17,600
row bust data set that they were looking at. And within those alive, they were looking at the

287
0:30:17,600 --> 0:30:27,600
COVID-19 group selected having a COVID-19 test that was positive before March 1st 2020 and November

288
0:30:27,600 --> 0:30:35,680
30 or between I should say between March 1st 2020 and November 30th 2020. So in this large set,

289
0:30:35,680 --> 0:30:40,640
they had found almost a hundred thousand individuals. And then they're going to look at these

290
0:30:40,640 --> 0:30:47,120
individuals and what did what did they find? So this study identified a significant increase

291
0:30:47,120 --> 0:30:53,120
in problems in this population that affected the respiratory system, the nervous system,

292
0:30:53,120 --> 0:30:59,360
neurocognitive disorders, mental health disorders, metabolic disorders, cardiovascular disorders,

293
0:30:59,360 --> 0:31:06,000
gastrointestinal disorders, malaise, fatigue, musculosceletal pain, anemia. This population

294
0:31:06,000 --> 0:31:13,360
had an increased use of many medications, particularly pain medications, opioids, non opioids, antidepressants,

295
0:31:13,360 --> 0:31:20,960
anxiolytics, antihypertensives, oral hypoglycemics. And they had evidence of laboratory abnormality,

296
0:31:20,960 --> 0:31:26,800
abnormalities in multiple organ systems. So what I think I'm going to just really point out here

297
0:31:26,800 --> 0:31:32,880
is that this analysis is suggesting that even people who do not identify or get classified as

298
0:31:32,880 --> 0:31:38,960
long COVID, there's really a lot of outcomes in addition that we're seeing are an increased

299
0:31:38,960 --> 0:31:44,000
incidence. And this is actually worth looking at this paper, I will say it's available nature.

300
0:31:44,000 --> 0:31:50,800
There's actually a gradation, right? So non hospitalized, hospitalized admitted to the ICU,

301
0:31:50,800 --> 0:31:56,080
the more severe your COVID, the higher incidence we were seeing of all these different

302
0:31:56,640 --> 0:32:02,480
disorders, right? So I think that we're seeing elevation in the non hospitalized as well,

303
0:32:02,480 --> 0:32:07,520
but increasing with more severity of disease. So I'm going to finish up on that note. And we

304
0:32:07,520 --> 0:32:12,480
are switching when this drops, it will be May 1st. Thank you, everyone who supported the

305
0:32:12,480 --> 0:32:18,000
market side of tropical medicine and hygiene. We are now going to support foundation,

306
0:32:18,000 --> 0:32:22,080
international medical relief of children. Again, this is going to be a three month campaign.

307
0:32:23,280 --> 0:32:27,040
To be honest, they're struggling, right? This is an organization that is supported

308
0:32:27,840 --> 0:32:33,680
through volunteers, younger individuals, excited about global health, signing up,

309
0:32:34,400 --> 0:32:39,360
contributing, going to all these parts of the world. They need our help. They need your help.

310
0:32:39,360 --> 0:32:44,960
So take a moment, go to parasites without borders.com and help us support that. We're

311
0:32:44,960 --> 0:32:47,920
going to do the same thing we've done before. We're going to double those donations. We're

312
0:32:47,920 --> 0:32:52,080
going to try to get up to $40,000 to support femuric. And we're going to do this over the

313
0:32:52,080 --> 0:32:57,200
next three months. So help us. Time for some email for Daniel. If you want to send one,

314
0:32:57,200 --> 0:33:04,240
Daniel at microbe.tv. Sarah in Tallahassee writes, are the monoclonal antibody therapies

315
0:33:04,240 --> 0:33:10,240
appropriate for patients who have already been vaccinated? So that's a great question. We are

316
0:33:10,240 --> 0:33:15,120
certainly giving monoclonals to people that have already been vaccinated, or I should word it.

317
0:33:15,120 --> 0:33:19,760
We are not restricting them. We are not taking a person who's vaccinated, not allowing them to

318
0:33:19,760 --> 0:33:24,240
have the monoclonals. And there's a couple of reasons here. One, if you think about it,

319
0:33:24,240 --> 0:33:28,320
there's usually something going on when a person has a breakthrough infection. And we've certainly

320
0:33:28,320 --> 0:33:33,840
seen people that get vaccinated, and then they go ahead and they get exposed. It's really sort of

321
0:33:33,840 --> 0:33:38,960
straightforward if they just got the vaccine. But we're seeing people that might be weeks out.

322
0:33:38,960 --> 0:33:44,800
Some people, particularly our older members of our society, people with certain immune issues,

323
0:33:44,800 --> 0:33:49,440
they may not have the ability to develop that robust immune system. We're going ahead. We're

324
0:33:49,440 --> 0:33:55,120
seeing good experiences as we get more numbers. I think we actually closed one of my studies. So

325
0:33:55,120 --> 0:33:59,760
hopefully we'll be getting some data out there showing demonstrating what's the efficacy in

326
0:33:59,760 --> 0:34:04,720
different populations, including this particular population. All right, we have a letter from Mike,

327
0:34:04,720 --> 0:34:11,280
who is an infectious disease physician in Tacoma. In your most recent clinical update, 747,

328
0:34:11,280 --> 0:34:15,680
you mentioned in your reply to the retired health and safety professional listeners question,

329
0:34:16,240 --> 0:34:21,280
as to why authorities are not recommending N95 respirators to the public, that you would

330
0:34:21,280 --> 0:34:26,560
recommend such masks in certain high risk situations or high risk environments. You then

331
0:34:26,560 --> 0:34:31,520
relayed your own story of how you recommended to your family members to wear KN95 masks when

332
0:34:31,520 --> 0:34:37,680
they flew on an airplane. The listener mentioned that he thought the KN95 Chinese masks available

333
0:34:37,680 --> 0:34:42,560
to him locally were likely made of similar materials and of similar quality to the 3M

334
0:34:43,120 --> 0:34:48,560
N95s. When they first came out, I was initially confused by the different KN95 designation on

335
0:34:48,560 --> 0:34:53,200
the respirators that were advertised from overseas and have been following the US government's evaluation

336
0:34:53,200 --> 0:34:58,320
of these masks since the time. Unfortunately, such US government testing has revealed that the

337
0:34:58,320 --> 0:35:04,480
overseas KN95 testing standards for such overseas masks have not been rigorously quality control.

338
0:35:04,480 --> 0:35:12,480
Many did not reliably come close to 95% filtration efficiency, and Mike provides a CDC link to

339
0:35:13,120 --> 0:35:18,320
a report on these masks. Thus, in the interest of being fully transparent to the listener

340
0:35:18,320 --> 0:35:24,080
who wrote in and to the public, I would suggest that KN95 respirators may provide you with more

341
0:35:24,080 --> 0:35:29,200
protection against SARS-CoV-2 than a cloth smath, but are overall not as quality controlled and

342
0:35:29,200 --> 0:35:35,280
would suggest the listener and public consult the above web link for more information.

343
0:35:35,280 --> 0:35:40,720
That is excellent. So thank you so much. I always like to point out that this is not really a one-man

344
0:35:40,720 --> 0:35:46,400
show, and stuff like this is super helpful. I'm starting to feel like should I have shared one of

345
0:35:46,400 --> 0:35:52,160
my KN95s or two of them with my daughter and my wife, but this is really well taken. I think that

346
0:35:52,160 --> 0:35:57,840
as we go forward, I'm actually surprised at this point that we don't have better certification.

347
0:35:57,840 --> 0:36:02,960
You get a mask and it's got a certain stamp or a certain... We have certifications for organic

348
0:36:02,960 --> 0:36:08,560
foods where the certifications to help us with masks, which actually are keeping us safe and

349
0:36:08,560 --> 0:36:13,120
saving lives. Excellent point, everyone. I'm glad that this was sent in.

350
0:36:13,120 --> 0:36:22,160
We have an email from Vincent, who is also a physician. Two questions. I recently immunized a

351
0:36:22,160 --> 0:36:28,080
49-year-old lady who has a history of Parkinson's and an active left septic bursitis with J&J.

352
0:36:28,080 --> 0:36:34,960
Should I have left held off due to her bursitis? Or was I right in doing so? Let's take that one

353
0:36:34,960 --> 0:36:40,320
first, Daniel. So you did the right thing. Never missed an opportunity to immunize that.

354
0:36:40,320 --> 0:36:44,800
I'm hoping you didn't put the immunization in that bursa, right? Maybe you did the other arm that

355
0:36:44,800 --> 0:36:50,480
would make a lot of sense. I got a question earlier today and actually it was about every

356
0:36:50,480 --> 0:36:54,160
so often we see people. We've got people doing vaccines that maybe have never done them before

357
0:36:54,160 --> 0:36:57,840
and they're somehow they get it in the bursa, which is actually usually a challenge, right?

358
0:36:57,840 --> 0:37:03,680
Because we're trying to learn to do that for other reasons. But try not to get it in the bursa.

359
0:37:04,240 --> 0:37:07,840
Do the other side if someone has bursitis. If they get it in the bursa,

360
0:37:07,840 --> 0:37:14,000
probably we're still going to get the protection. I think it would make sense that you will.

361
0:37:14,800 --> 0:37:19,280
But no, I don't think something like a bursitis. We really have to be careful not let little

362
0:37:19,280 --> 0:37:23,840
things keep us from getting a person vaccinated. So I think you did the right thing. Now,

363
0:37:24,320 --> 0:37:28,240
hopefully I laid out the risks with J&J really small.

364
0:37:28,240 --> 0:37:33,760
Yeah, and then his next question is about J&J. Is it stand to reason to treat with aspirin prophylactically

365
0:37:33,760 --> 0:37:38,080
or just wait it out? Yeah, and I've actually had this conversation with a lot of clinicians.

366
0:37:38,080 --> 0:37:43,280
So it really is excellent. It's a good question. If you start doing the risk benefit,

367
0:37:43,280 --> 0:37:47,440
and this was interesting, right? I started asking people, so what if you tell someone to take an

368
0:37:47,440 --> 0:37:52,320
aspirin every day? 1% of those people will have a GI bleed within the year, right? We didn't pull

369
0:37:52,320 --> 0:37:59,120
aspirin off the market when that happened. You are better off doing nothing. First, do no harm.

370
0:37:59,120 --> 0:38:04,080
You are more likely to cause problems to someone after a J&J than you're going to

371
0:38:04,080 --> 0:38:09,120
provide any help by throwing aspirin or anything at them. So go ahead, get them vaccinated. And

372
0:38:09,120 --> 0:38:12,640
then if they have a severe headache, that one in a million will pick it up, we'll treat them

373
0:38:12,640 --> 0:38:17,840
properly. All right, one more from Chris in your recent clinical update. You said

374
0:38:18,400 --> 0:38:23,680
responsible summer camps should be doing testing because there's funding for it now. I'm on the

375
0:38:23,680 --> 0:38:29,360
board of a summer camp. This is good news, but I can't find any information. Can you please

376
0:38:29,360 --> 0:38:35,600
point to more information about this? Okay, I'm going to actually, I'm going to say this slowly

377
0:38:35,600 --> 0:38:41,600
because we'll be giving this person a bunch of emails, hopefully. I've been working with a woman

378
0:38:41,600 --> 0:38:49,520
Phoebe for about the last year, helping promote access to coordination for particularly rapid

379
0:38:49,520 --> 0:38:56,320
testing, but testing in general as a solution. And so Phoebe has worked with rapid testing.org,

380
0:38:56,320 --> 0:39:01,840
also worked with a lot of different foundations, and actually did a lot to push for funding in

381
0:39:01,840 --> 0:39:07,680
these bills. So I can give her a little credit for that. Now I asked Phoebe previously, and she

382
0:39:07,680 --> 0:39:15,360
said yes that I could share when people had questions like this. So her email is P-O-L-H-A-V-A

383
0:39:15,360 --> 0:39:21,040
at gmail.com. If you're a summer camp, if you're looking for ways to get access to testing,

384
0:39:21,760 --> 0:39:26,240
shoot her an email. She's not in this to make any money. I think she must make money as a

385
0:39:26,240 --> 0:39:31,200
radiologist or something. She's just there to help doing all these efforts pro bono. So

386
0:39:32,080 --> 0:39:37,520
reach out. Let's make sure that that money actually is spent, that that testing keeps our kids safe.

387
0:39:37,520 --> 0:39:42,720
That's COVID-19 clinical update number 60 with Dr. Daniel Griffin. Thank you, Daniel.

388
0:39:42,720 --> 0:39:49,440
Oh, thank you so much. And everyone, be safe.
