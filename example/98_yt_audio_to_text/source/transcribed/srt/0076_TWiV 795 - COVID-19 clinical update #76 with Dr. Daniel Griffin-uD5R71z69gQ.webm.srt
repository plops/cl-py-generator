0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:06,880
This week in virology, the podcast about viruses, the kind that make you sick.

2
0:00:10,240 --> 0:00:20,960
From Microbe TV, this is Twiv, this week in virology, episode 795, recorded on August 19th, 2021.

3
0:00:21,520 --> 0:00:26,800
I'm Vincent Rack and Yellow, and you're listening to the podcast all about viruses. Joining me

4
0:00:26,800 --> 0:00:34,320
today from New York, Daniel Griffin. Hello, everyone. Hey, Daniel, what do you think about

5
0:00:34,320 --> 0:00:40,880
boosters? You going to talk about that today? I'm sure that will come up, but an episode will

6
0:00:40,880 --> 0:00:46,160
not go by without discussing that hot topic. Every week, there's a hot topic, right?

7
0:00:47,120 --> 0:00:51,120
You know, I keep thinking that there's going to be some point in time when it just settles down,

8
0:00:51,120 --> 0:00:56,240
and I have nothing to say, and I look forward to that point in time. We're not there yet.

9
0:00:56,240 --> 0:01:06,160
No, but this is update number 76. Yeah, maybe at update 100, we will reach that point.

10
0:01:07,280 --> 0:01:13,440
Maybe that's optimism. When we get to clinical update 100, we'll see if I was optimistic or not.

11
0:01:13,440 --> 0:01:17,440
All right. All right, well, let's get fired up because we got a lot to do today, and I'll start

12
0:01:17,440 --> 0:01:25,120
with my quotation. There is only one sin, and that is theft. When you tell a lie, you steal

13
0:01:25,120 --> 0:01:29,440
someone's right to the truth. And I don't know if I'm going to pronounce this correctly, but this

14
0:01:29,440 --> 0:01:38,000
is by the author of the kite rudder, Kaleid Hasani. So maybe our writers can let us know if I pronounce

15
0:01:38,000 --> 0:01:46,320
that correctly. Actually, I'm a great fan of this man's work, his books, and this has really been

16
0:01:46,320 --> 0:01:51,200
a tough, really been a tough week, particularly in Afghanistan seeing what's happening there. So

17
0:01:52,080 --> 0:01:58,160
Hart goes out to all those individuals. Now, I'd like to say a single point does not make a line,

18
0:01:58,160 --> 0:02:05,200
so I'm going to keep building on the knowledge we have. But people know that here in the U.S.

19
0:02:05,200 --> 0:02:10,800
things are not going well in a lot of parts of the country, but let's start off with children.

20
0:02:10,800 --> 0:02:17,680
Children may be at low risk, but they are not at no risk, and I've added to this wearing a mask is

21
0:02:17,680 --> 0:02:23,920
less traumatic for a child than being hospitalized. I think we're all aware that there's actually

22
0:02:23,920 --> 0:02:32,320
been some rather odd behavior around this respiratory contagion and children. And we got the article

23
0:02:32,880 --> 0:02:38,720
Association of Age and Pediatric Household Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 Infection published

24
0:02:38,720 --> 0:02:44,800
in JAMA Pediatrics addressing some of the questions around children of various ages and

25
0:02:44,800 --> 0:02:50,560
transmission. And I must say, when I brought up this study, my wife was like, well, I can tell

26
0:02:50,560 --> 0:02:57,440
you what it's going to show. She was right spot on. So this was a cohort study where the authors

27
0:02:57,440 --> 0:03:06,000
looked at 6,280 households that had pediatric index cases and of these, well, about a quarter.

28
0:03:06,000 --> 0:03:13,760
So 1717 households, 27.3% experienced secondary transmission. So just to give you a sense,

29
0:03:14,400 --> 0:03:21,120
this is a household with a child with COVID at about a quarter of them, despite doing whatever

30
0:03:21,120 --> 0:03:28,560
precautions still had secondary transmission. So the authors reported that children aged zero

31
0:03:28,560 --> 0:03:31,600
to three. So they're going to break this down by different age groups. And this could be the

32
0:03:31,600 --> 0:03:38,960
question, who's going to be the highest rate of transmitting? So they're going to use age 14 to

33
0:03:38,960 --> 0:03:44,720
17 as our sort of reference, our adolescents 14 to 17. And then we're going to compare

34
0:03:45,440 --> 0:03:50,320
different age children to those folks. So looking at the zero to three years,

35
0:03:50,960 --> 0:03:55,840
these individuals, the youngest, had the highest odds of transmitting SARS-CoV-2

36
0:03:55,840 --> 0:04:05,360
to household context. Their odds ratio relative to the 14 to 17 was 1.43. And this association

37
0:04:05,360 --> 0:04:11,680
was similarly observed in sensitivity, looking at secondary cases. And so basically going through

38
0:04:11,680 --> 0:04:19,440
the older the kids were, when you got to four to eight, you had a slightly lower, was 1.4,

39
0:04:19,440 --> 0:04:27,120
when you got up to the nine to 13, when you got up to these older. So the highest transmission

40
0:04:27,120 --> 0:04:33,520
was in the youngest individual. So there's been this odd idea that I think our listeners are

41
0:04:33,520 --> 0:04:38,160
probably aware of this odd idea that somehow children can't get COVID and that they can't

42
0:04:38,160 --> 0:04:47,440
transmit, can't transmit the virus. So this is just basically letting us know that, yes,

43
0:04:47,440 --> 0:04:52,080
if children do get infected, they can transmit it in the household context.

44
0:04:52,720 --> 0:04:59,360
Now I'm going to move on to our testing transmission area. And I like to just remind people, I was

45
0:04:59,360 --> 0:05:04,240
in the Brian Lair Show a couple days ago. And there was a whole question about rapid antigen

46
0:05:04,240 --> 0:05:11,520
testing. Are we done with that? And just another study to remind people of how useful rapid

47
0:05:11,520 --> 0:05:18,560
resulting tests can be. And this was the report use of rapid antigen testing for SARS-CoV-2

48
0:05:18,560 --> 0:05:25,520
in remote communities, looking at Yukon, Cuskquim, Delta region, Alaska. And they looked at the

49
0:05:25,520 --> 0:05:34,080
period of time from September 15, 2020 to March 1, 2021. And here, no surprise, the authors reported

50
0:05:34,080 --> 0:05:41,200
that the introduction of rapid point of care antigen testing in this region was followed by

51
0:05:41,200 --> 0:05:48,080
more than a threefold reduction in daily SARS-CoV-2 case rates. And this gets back to something

52
0:05:48,080 --> 0:05:54,240
we've been talking about for well over a year now. And it's that one of the great things about

53
0:05:54,240 --> 0:05:59,120
these point of care antigen tests is you get a result right away. You can quickly remove an

54
0:05:59,120 --> 0:06:04,400
infected person from the transmission cycle, where particularly you look at an area like

55
0:06:04,400 --> 0:06:10,960
remote Alaska to get a return PCR result can actually take a significant amount of time. And

56
0:06:10,960 --> 0:06:17,360
during that time, that individual can continue to transmit the virus. And we still have on our

57
0:06:17,360 --> 0:06:21,760
parasites without borders that calculator, where you can look at different sensitivities, different

58
0:06:21,760 --> 0:06:27,200
approaches. And one of the things I was talking about is a lot of people have started to say,

59
0:06:27,200 --> 0:06:32,160
this is not true, but they do say it, that, oh, these rapid antigen tests, they don't work for the

60
0:06:32,160 --> 0:06:39,120
Delta variant. But remember, the Delta variant has some changes in the spike protein, still plenty

61
0:06:39,120 --> 0:06:43,680
of nucleocapsid being produced. That's the protein we're picking up with these tests.

62
0:06:43,680 --> 0:06:50,160
Are they 100% sensitive? 100% sensitive? No. But are they 80 or 90% sensitive when properly done?

63
0:06:50,160 --> 0:06:55,760
Yes. So, you know, four out of five times, you're catching that person right away in 15 minutes.

64
0:06:55,760 --> 0:07:00,720
If you're still concerned, you can still send off that secondary test. So it makes a lot of sense.

65
0:07:00,720 --> 0:07:06,560
If they're positive, great. You can immediately intervene. If they're negative, and it doesn't

66
0:07:06,560 --> 0:07:12,640
make sense, or you want to have a higher sensitivity, you can always add a PCR on top of rapid testing.

67
0:07:12,640 --> 0:07:17,040
Now, in the MMWR, I'm sure Vince is going to jump in on this one.

68
0:07:17,680 --> 0:07:23,840
Shedding of infectious SARS-CoV-2, despite vaccination when the Delta variant is prevalent,

69
0:07:23,840 --> 0:07:30,240
Wisconsin July 2021 was posted as a preprint. Now, it was told to me, and I didn't actually see

70
0:07:30,240 --> 0:07:36,000
this initially, but this was sort of tweeted my way that initially this was posted with the B-Wirt,

71
0:07:36,560 --> 0:07:40,400
and they updated it because they knew that we would find that B-Wirt offensive,

72
0:07:40,400 --> 0:07:47,680
and they decided to use a much more appropriate term, just infectious cases in vaccinated

73
0:07:47,680 --> 0:07:53,600
individuals. So I have that on unreliable authority. I probably should have asked one of the authors

74
0:07:53,600 --> 0:07:59,680
when I was emailing with him. But in this report, in this preprint using PCR cycle thresholds,

75
0:07:59,680 --> 0:08:06,640
CT data, they actually went ahead and they looked at, can we actually culture

76
0:08:07,520 --> 0:08:13,200
virus from these individuals? And they report that, yes, in the majority of individuals

77
0:08:13,920 --> 0:08:20,960
with CT values less than 25, whether vaccinated or unvaccinated, they were able to actually culture

78
0:08:20,960 --> 0:08:30,080
virus. So they did this in Vero cells. They report in Figure 2 that they were able to see

79
0:08:30,080 --> 0:08:37,200
cytopathic effects after five days of replication in the Vero E6 TMPR SS2 cells.

80
0:08:38,720 --> 0:08:43,680
But we don't get any quantification. And that's really what I was hoping because

81
0:08:43,680 --> 0:08:49,360
the really question is, does this add anything? We know that vaccinated people can get infected.

82
0:08:49,360 --> 0:08:53,920
We know that vaccinated people can transmit. So we already sort of knew going into this that there

83
0:08:53,920 --> 0:09:00,080
had to be replication, competent virus there. The real question is, do those CT values mean

84
0:09:00,080 --> 0:09:06,160
the same thing in a vaccinated and unvaccinated person at one point in time? Because we do know

85
0:09:06,160 --> 0:09:12,080
that that CT value drops more quickly in vaccinated individuals. So I reached out to Dave O'Connor,

86
0:09:12,080 --> 0:09:18,160
who actually was on Twiv 260 with Thomas Friedrich. So I'll call them your colleagues. I don't know

87
0:09:18,160 --> 0:09:23,840
if you guys are friends. And I really wanted to know a couple of things. Hopefully we could

88
0:09:23,840 --> 0:09:29,440
start using the terminology viral RNA load instead of just viral load, because we don't know if this

89
0:09:29,440 --> 0:09:36,720
is virus. We know it's RNA load. But I still really want to know the quantification. So Vincent,

90
0:09:36,720 --> 0:09:38,720
I thought you would have comments on this paper.

91
0:09:39,920 --> 0:09:47,520
I think this is almost criminal to publish, because as you say, they simply take the

92
0:09:47,520 --> 0:09:52,320
nasopharyngeal wash and throw it on cells and culture, and they get infection. There could be

93
0:09:53,120 --> 0:10:01,040
one pfu in the vaccine sample and many more in the unvaccinated sample. So the authors say,

94
0:10:01,600 --> 0:10:06,320
our data substantiate the idea that vaccinated individuals who become infected with Delta may

95
0:10:06,320 --> 0:10:12,080
have the potential to transmit. Actually, it doesn't substantiate it at all. It makes no

96
0:10:12,080 --> 0:10:17,200
conclusions possible. And I'm really surprised that they're trying to publish this. And you know,

97
0:10:17,200 --> 0:10:22,960
the problem, Daniel, is it's a nuance that the mass media is not going to pick up. And that's a

98
0:10:22,960 --> 0:10:28,880
problem. Yeah, I mean, this is the we've entered this different world, right, the world of preprints.

99
0:10:29,600 --> 0:10:35,360
And I did reach out to Dave O'Connor. He emailed me back that they are going to actually are in

100
0:10:35,360 --> 0:10:41,040
the process of looking at the quantification of the cytopathic effects. And that's really what

101
0:10:41,040 --> 0:10:45,600
you need. So this, yeah, by the time it gets published, we'll have that. The only problem in

102
0:10:45,600 --> 0:10:49,760
and I agree with you in the preprint world. And I've been sort of glad the media hasn't jumped too

103
0:10:49,760 --> 0:10:55,840
much on this. This quickly becomes confirmation of this idea that vaccinated people are driving

104
0:10:55,840 --> 0:11:01,520
the pandemic that vaccines are failing. And none of that is true. We are still seeing

105
0:11:02,160 --> 0:11:05,760
vaccines are incredibly effective. And we'll get into that as we discuss

106
0:11:06,320 --> 0:11:11,760
boosters when we get into active vaccination. So all right, I will return to this paper. I hope

107
0:11:11,760 --> 0:11:19,040
when we have some quantification data there, but the sky has not fallen. Well, on the 12th day

108
0:11:19,040 --> 0:11:28,400
of August 2021, the FDA said let there be boosters. And so they went ahead. The US FDA amended the

109
0:11:28,400 --> 0:11:34,720
emergency use authorization for both the Pfizer by and tech COVID-19 vaccine and the Moderna COVID-19

110
0:11:34,720 --> 0:11:40,720
vaccine to allow for an additional dose in certain individuals. Now, what did I like about this

111
0:11:40,720 --> 0:11:45,600
announcement? Well, what I liked Vincent and listeners is that when they did this, they threw

112
0:11:45,600 --> 0:11:49,760
a line in where they said it is recommended that immunocompromised individuals discuss

113
0:11:49,760 --> 0:11:54,320
monoclonal antibody treatment options with their health care provider should they contract or

114
0:11:54,320 --> 0:12:02,320
be exposed to COVID-19. So what do we do have great science that an individual who gets infected,

115
0:12:02,320 --> 0:12:07,680
who is at high risk if they get the monoclonal antibodies that this really is associated with

116
0:12:07,680 --> 0:12:14,480
a reduction in their chance of a bad outcome. But do we know whether or not a third dose of

117
0:12:14,480 --> 0:12:21,040
vaccine will give them benefit? And I'm going to say as we move forward, I'm going to return and

118
0:12:21,040 --> 0:12:26,160
again say that we are still lacking that data. Yeah, we can get some antibody levels a bit higher,

119
0:12:26,160 --> 0:12:31,600
but what does that really translate into? So who are these individuals who are now eligible?

120
0:12:31,600 --> 0:12:37,040
And many of the states have already jumped on. And as of Monday, this has been happening in

121
0:12:37,040 --> 0:12:44,160
several states. The CDC is recommending that moderately to severe immunocompromised people

122
0:12:44,960 --> 0:12:50,080
can receive an additional dose. And this includes, I'm going to give the six categories.

123
0:12:50,080 --> 0:12:54,800
One, been receiving active cancer treatment for tumors or cancers of the blood.

124
0:12:55,360 --> 0:12:59,680
Two, received an organ transplant and are taking medicine to suppress the immune system.

125
0:12:59,680 --> 0:13:05,440
Three, received a stem cell transplant within the last two years, or are taking medicine to

126
0:13:05,440 --> 0:13:11,920
suppress the immune system. Four, moderately or severe primary immunodeficiency. Let me give

127
0:13:11,920 --> 0:13:18,720
some examples, advanced or untreated HIV, or active treatment with high dose corticosteroids,

128
0:13:18,720 --> 0:13:25,520
or other drugs that may suppress your immune system. Now, we do hear that on the 20th of

129
0:13:25,520 --> 0:13:31,840
September, that week, booster is going to be rolled out to the entire population that's eligible

130
0:13:31,840 --> 0:13:37,600
in the US. But if you look at these six categories, this is actually a very small subset. This is

131
0:13:37,600 --> 0:13:44,880
not I'm 65 and overweight. This is not I have multiple medical comorbidities. These are really

132
0:13:45,920 --> 0:13:50,480
severely moderately to severely immunocompromised people that have been added now.

133
0:13:50,480 --> 0:13:57,600
And then again, the suggestion is that the third week of September, this will roll out to a larger

134
0:13:57,600 --> 0:14:03,680
population. And don't worry, I'm going to hit some of the studies that supposedly support this

135
0:14:03,680 --> 0:14:13,360
concept. Lots of vaccine mandates on April. So there was a new vaccine mandate for New York State.

136
0:14:13,360 --> 0:14:20,240
And this came out on, I say April, but it's actually August 16th. I'm going to update that.

137
0:14:20,800 --> 0:14:27,760
All healthcare workers in New York State will be required to be vaccinated by Monday, September 27th.

138
0:14:27,760 --> 0:14:33,360
And this will include staff at hospitals, long-term care facilities, nursing homes, adult care,

139
0:14:33,360 --> 0:14:40,960
and any other congregate care settings. And there will be certain vaccinations limited for

140
0:14:40,960 --> 0:14:46,160
religious and medical reasons. But remember, those medical reasons are incredibly limited.

141
0:14:46,160 --> 0:14:51,120
Basically, it's a person who had an adverse reaction to this vaccine, or one of the components of

142
0:14:51,120 --> 0:14:56,320
this vaccine. It's not I have lupus. It's not I have high blood pressure. It's not I'm allergic

143
0:14:56,320 --> 0:15:01,840
to bees or talcum powder. The medical exceptions are very narrow. So I know there's already a lot

144
0:15:01,840 --> 0:15:07,760
of people running out to see if their family doctor will write them a note. Those notes really

145
0:15:07,760 --> 0:15:13,200
are not going to mean much unless you have had an anaphylactic serious reaction to a component in

146
0:15:13,200 --> 0:15:19,040
these vaccines. What about vaccines and variants? Who's to blame? That's what we like to do as a

147
0:15:19,040 --> 0:15:26,560
society. Along the lines of no one is safe until anyone is safe. There was a preprint that I found

148
0:15:26,560 --> 0:15:32,720
rather interesting. And this was full vaccination suppresses SARS-CoV-2 delta variant mutation

149
0:15:32,720 --> 0:15:39,840
frequency. And it wasn't frequency. So just full vaccination suppresses SARS-CoV-2 delta variant

150
0:15:39,840 --> 0:15:47,760
mutation frequency. Now, the authors analyzed SARS-CoV-2 delta variant sequences from Australia,

151
0:15:47,760 --> 0:15:55,680
France, Germany, Indonesia, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal,

152
0:15:55,680 --> 0:16:01,840
Singapore, Spain, Switzerland, Sweden, Turkey, the US and the UK. There was a lot of data. This

153
0:16:01,840 --> 0:16:09,600
all came from the global initiative on sharing all influenza data. So this is the G said G-I-S-A-I-D.

154
0:16:10,640 --> 0:16:15,840
And they had a number of different variant sequences. And they did. I don't know if anyone's

155
0:16:15,840 --> 0:16:24,080
familiar with the Tahima D test. I lit that up. This was new to me. But really, I thought it was

156
0:16:24,080 --> 0:16:29,120
interesting. In Figure 1, they show a mutational frequency on the y-axis. They show the fully

157
0:16:29,120 --> 0:16:36,000
vaccinated rate. Really areas with high mutational frequency had low fully vaccinated rates.

158
0:16:36,000 --> 0:16:42,160
Areas with low mutational frequency had lower fully vaccinated rates. This makes biological

159
0:16:42,160 --> 0:16:49,040
sense. The more you give the virus a chance to replicate, you would expect higher mutational

160
0:16:49,040 --> 0:16:55,760
frequencies. But I don't want people to run out and start yelling at the unvaccinated people

161
0:16:55,760 --> 0:17:01,120
claiming that they are a menace to society based on this one paper. But it is an interesting

162
0:17:01,760 --> 0:17:04,640
report. Vincent's got his hand up. Jump in, Vincent.

163
0:17:05,760 --> 0:17:10,640
Actually, an incorrect interpretation. The mutation frequency is not affected,

164
0:17:10,640 --> 0:17:16,240
because the mutation frequency of the virus is a constant. What is affected is selection

165
0:17:16,800 --> 0:17:23,440
out of that pool of variants of ones with changes, depending on the factors that they

166
0:17:23,440 --> 0:17:28,880
look at in this paper, vaccination in this point. It is not correct that vaccination

167
0:17:28,880 --> 0:17:33,760
suppresses the mutation frequency. It suppresses the number of changes that you see ending up in

168
0:17:33,760 --> 0:17:38,400
spike as a result of selection. Does it make sense? It makes a lot sense, because this is really

169
0:17:38,400 --> 0:17:44,400
not looking at the mutational frequency as far as occurring. It is looking at an end product.

170
0:17:44,400 --> 0:17:49,120
Exactly. I am sorry to keep in trouble. No, I think that is helpful.

171
0:17:49,120 --> 0:17:54,640
Because I have a lot of questions from people. How do the mutation frequency is affected?

172
0:17:54,640 --> 0:17:56,560
No, no, no, no, no. It is not.

173
0:17:57,840 --> 0:18:00,560
I would like to, maybe we could say this is you get to roll the dice less.

174
0:18:02,080 --> 0:18:08,800
Still get against the same number of you. All right. Now, boosters. This is the only reason

175
0:18:08,800 --> 0:18:13,200
Vincent is here today. No, no, no. I am here every week for the same reason.

176
0:18:13,200 --> 0:18:19,440
So this is the special secret data that we were, we were not allowed to know about,

177
0:18:19,440 --> 0:18:23,520
but now it's being shared with us. So there were several, several reports that came out.

178
0:18:23,520 --> 0:18:29,600
So one came out in the MMWR, effectiveness of the Pfizer, BioNTech, and Moderna vaccines

179
0:18:29,600 --> 0:18:34,640
in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection among nursing home residents before and during widespread

180
0:18:34,640 --> 0:18:42,640
circulation of the SARS-CoV-2 be 1617.2, the Delta variant, National Healthcare Safety Network,

181
0:18:42,640 --> 0:18:50,000
March 1 through August 1, 2021. So this is an MMWR early release. And it's interesting,

182
0:18:50,000 --> 0:18:56,080
I had a discussion with one of my colleagues about what were MMWRs? What were MMWR early releases

183
0:18:56,080 --> 0:19:00,640
before the pandemic? Really, was there many people other than me and my infectious disease

184
0:19:00,640 --> 0:19:05,200
colleagues that looked at these? And now they've become primetime. They're sort of being asked to

185
0:19:05,200 --> 0:19:10,000
be something they weren't before this. And we'll get into that whole idea of asking something to be

186
0:19:10,000 --> 0:19:17,040
something that it was not asked to be before. But in this weekly report, they looked at data

187
0:19:17,040 --> 0:19:24,000
that was reported to CMS Centers for Medicaid and Medicare, certified skilled nursing facilities

188
0:19:24,000 --> 0:19:31,440
or nursing homes. This was the National Healthcare Safety Network and analyzed to evaluate. And

189
0:19:31,440 --> 0:19:37,920
this is interesting, the effectiveness of full vaccination with any of the two currently authorized

190
0:19:37,920 --> 0:19:46,640
mRNA COVID-19 vaccines on effectiveness against infection, right? So this is where we're suddenly

191
0:19:46,640 --> 0:19:55,760
asking vaccines to do something quite different. And so using 17,470, so I'm going to try that again,

192
0:19:55,760 --> 0:20:04,160
17,407 weekly reports from almost 4,000 facilities from the pre-Delta period, adjusted effectiveness

193
0:20:04,160 --> 0:20:13,840
against infection for any mRNA vaccine was reported to be 74.7%. They then followed it up with this

194
0:20:13,840 --> 0:20:22,080
intermediate period where they reported it was 67.5. And then they looked at 85,593 weekly reports

195
0:20:22,080 --> 0:20:29,440
from 14,917 facilities during the period when the Delta variant was becoming prevalent.

196
0:20:29,440 --> 0:20:35,280
And here they reported an adjusted effectiveness against infection of 53%.

197
0:20:35,920 --> 0:20:41,120
And they say this was similar for Pfizer, BioNTech, and Moderna. So the point I want to make,

198
0:20:41,120 --> 0:20:45,920
and I'm Vince and I am sure you will jump in on this. So I'm already prompting you to do that,

199
0:20:45,920 --> 0:20:50,160
is I was asked by someone today, said, I was watching a Fox News report and they're saying,

200
0:20:50,160 --> 0:20:55,600
oh, these vaccines, look at this. If you had a vaccine that was as crummy as this, what would

201
0:20:55,600 --> 0:21:01,520
you do? And I wanted to point out to this gentleman, we are suddenly asking the vaccines to do

202
0:21:01,520 --> 0:21:07,440
something that the vaccines were not necessarily designed to do. We designed these vaccines.

203
0:21:07,440 --> 0:21:13,680
Vaccines traditionally have protected us against disease, against serious disease ending up in

204
0:21:13,680 --> 0:21:20,880
the hospital, dying. Suddenly these vaccines have a new superpower. They are actually protecting

205
0:21:20,880 --> 0:21:26,720
people. They are effective against infection. I mean, this is tremendous and continues to be

206
0:21:26,720 --> 0:21:32,720
tremendous. So I don't walk away with this being being worried. And now maybe we're saying we want

207
0:21:32,720 --> 0:21:37,680
them to do this new superpower even better. And so we're asking if we give a third dose,

208
0:21:37,680 --> 0:21:42,640
can we do even better effectiveness against infection? But this is not failure. This is actually

209
0:21:42,640 --> 0:21:47,280
vaccines with a new superpower being asked to do even more. So Vincent, I don't know if you had a

210
0:21:47,280 --> 0:21:51,760
comment. Well, the problem here is that, as you said, they're looking at infection. And the

211
0:21:51,760 --> 0:21:56,960
infection efficacy declines because serum antibody declines after vaccination or infection. It always

212
0:21:56,960 --> 0:22:01,280
does. It's not surprising. We just for other vaccines, we never really looked at infection.

213
0:22:01,280 --> 0:22:07,840
We just looked at disease. And that's how these vaccines were tested. They do note this analysis

214
0:22:08,640 --> 0:22:13,360
assessed VE against infection without being able to distinguish between asymptomatic and

215
0:22:13,360 --> 0:22:17,760
symptomatic presentations. Additionally, valuations are needed to understand protection

216
0:22:17,760 --> 0:22:23,040
against disease and nursing home residents. That's the key. And I bet it's not declining,

217
0:22:23,040 --> 0:22:26,640
as you're probably going to tell us from some other studies that came out in the same issue.

218
0:22:27,680 --> 0:22:33,360
Yes. So let's hit this a couple others, which I think are reassuring because there were a couple

219
0:22:33,360 --> 0:22:40,080
other releases. So one was new COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations among adults by vaccination

220
0:22:40,080 --> 0:22:48,000
status New York May 3rd through July 25, 2021. And so this is looking at real world effect of this,

221
0:22:48,000 --> 0:22:53,840
the general population here in New York. And these authors link to information from four

222
0:22:53,840 --> 0:23:00,960
large databases to construct a surveillance based cohort of adults age greater than or equal to 18

223
0:23:00,960 --> 0:23:10,240
years residing in New York. And they found that new COVID-19 hospitalizations were 0.17 per 100,000

224
0:23:10,240 --> 0:23:18,800
person days in the fully vaccinated compared with 2.03 per 100,000 person days among the unvaccinated.

225
0:23:19,360 --> 0:23:24,800
And they concluded that the overall age adjusted vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization in

226
0:23:24,800 --> 0:23:34,640
New York had remained relatively stable, 91.9 to 95.3%. I mean, so I have to say, this is what the

227
0:23:34,640 --> 0:23:41,840
vaccines were designed to do. They continue to be highly effective in preventing hospitalization

228
0:23:41,840 --> 0:23:47,840
greater than 90% for fully vaccinated New York residents, even during a period when the prevalence

229
0:23:47,840 --> 0:23:55,280
of the Delta variant increased from less than 2% to greater than 80%. And when so many of the

230
0:23:55,280 --> 0:24:01,280
non-pharmaceutical prevention strategies, the societal public health restrictions were eased.

231
0:24:01,280 --> 0:24:06,880
So getting rid of the mask wearing, cranking those restaurants back up to 100% capacity

232
0:24:06,880 --> 0:24:09,840
and the like. And a hand is up for Vincent Rackeniello.

233
0:24:09,840 --> 0:24:17,520
And the same period when the hospitalization against hospitalization was steady, the VE against

234
0:24:17,520 --> 0:24:23,680
infection went from 90 to 80% of decline. So it just goes to show a decline in preventing infection

235
0:24:23,680 --> 0:24:28,560
doesn't matter. They know how to do it in New York state. Maybe you were involved with this

236
0:24:28,560 --> 0:24:34,960
because it's done right. Now, along these same reassuring lines, I'm going to give you a third.

237
0:24:34,960 --> 0:24:40,000
So hopefully people are going to walk away. Dr. Griffin, you started so for Lauren, but now

238
0:24:40,000 --> 0:24:45,360
you're giving us good news, sustained effectiveness of Pfizer, biotech, and Moderna vaccines against

239
0:24:45,360 --> 0:24:52,240
COVID-19 associated vaccines among adults. And this is United States March through July 2021.

240
0:24:52,960 --> 0:24:58,160
And this is not just in New York, but here the investigators found again, the vaccine

241
0:24:58,160 --> 0:25:05,120
effectiveness was 86%, two to 12 weeks after vaccination, 84% at 13 to 24 weeks. Really,

242
0:25:05,120 --> 0:25:10,800
the vaccine effectiveness was sustained among groups at risk for severe COVID-19. So a second

243
0:25:10,800 --> 0:25:14,800
study looking at a different population continuing to have some really reassuring.

244
0:25:16,160 --> 0:25:22,160
So here's the big question. Where's the science? Why are we giving everyone third doses? Are we

245
0:25:22,160 --> 0:25:27,200
just going to bump anybody levels? Do we really have evidence that this will translate into

246
0:25:27,200 --> 0:25:32,160
real world benefit, keeping people out of hospital, keeping people from dying, keeping people from

247
0:25:32,160 --> 0:25:37,840
getting sick, keeping people from ending up with long COVID? That's data we still need.

248
0:25:37,840 --> 0:25:44,080
So booster or not, Daniel? You know, you know, Midston, I actually had a sleepless night about

249
0:25:44,080 --> 0:25:49,120
this the other day because, you know, it came to me sort of this issue of I say, Oh, Dr. Griffin,

250
0:25:49,120 --> 0:25:54,000
you're eligible for a third shot. Do you want one? And there really is this sort of embarrassing

251
0:25:54,000 --> 0:25:59,040
equity issue, right? I mean, I feel like I'm at the family table, you know, and Uncle John,

252
0:25:59,040 --> 0:26:03,600
you know, just showed up and, you know, and he hasn't gotten a first portion and they want to

253
0:26:03,600 --> 0:26:09,200
know if I want to get, you know, thirds. And I actually, I have to say, I feel a bit embarrassed

254
0:26:10,000 --> 0:26:16,400
about the global vaccination rollout and this whole concept that without, you know, data,

255
0:26:16,400 --> 0:26:20,400
like, well, what benefit are we really getting, particularly when it rolls out of someone I like

256
0:26:20,400 --> 0:26:25,440
to think of myself as young and healthy? Do I really need that third shot? I mean, if it's going

257
0:26:25,440 --> 0:26:30,800
to go in the trash, if they're like, hey, Dr. Griffin, you know, we had a no show and we're not

258
0:26:30,800 --> 0:26:35,120
sure what to do with this. Okay, that's that's a different scenario. But the idea that we're

259
0:26:35,120 --> 0:26:38,800
going to keep buying hundreds of millions of vaccines that we're not going to somehow modify

260
0:26:38,800 --> 0:26:44,400
our bureaucracy and share, you know, we're in a global pandemic. It's time for the bureaucracy to

261
0:26:44,400 --> 0:26:49,040
add and people to be a little more reasonable. So can I ask you, Daniel, though, let's say we

262
0:26:49,040 --> 0:26:52,880
did give a third dose. I presume within eight months, the levels of antibodies are going to

263
0:26:52,880 --> 0:26:56,720
wane again. So are we going to give a dose every eight months? Is that the plan?

264
0:26:57,520 --> 0:27:01,920
That sounds like the current plan. Sounds like where we're headed every eight, you know, maybe we'll

265
0:27:01,920 --> 0:27:07,600
do it every six because who can keep track of every eight? But yeah, I don't understand the,

266
0:27:07,600 --> 0:27:12,640
you know, and I, you know, to bounce back to Afghanistan. What's the end game? What are we doing?

267
0:27:12,640 --> 0:27:16,640
Where are we going with this? Are we going to just keep every six months? And after a while,

268
0:27:16,640 --> 0:27:21,120
you're going to have to start wondering what's the safety, you know, profile of we keep doing this

269
0:27:21,120 --> 0:27:26,240
every every six months, every eight months, you know, with the influenza vaccine, it doesn't even

270
0:27:26,240 --> 0:27:30,880
work well when you have to get everyone back every year for a new shot, right? It's the update is

271
0:27:30,880 --> 0:27:36,480
very low. So I think it's a public health problem. Yeah. And from a public health problem, what is

272
0:27:36,480 --> 0:27:41,440
fueling this pandemic? Not people failing to get a third shot is people failing to get the first

273
0:27:41,440 --> 0:27:46,640
to exactly that. I think we should push to get people vaccinated, not to give those who are

274
0:27:46,640 --> 0:27:53,920
already ever vaccinated a third shot. That's crazy. Oh, well, all right. So the period of

275
0:27:53,920 --> 0:27:58,800
detectable viral replication, the viral symptom phase, right? This is that that first week for

276
0:27:58,800 --> 0:28:03,600
most people. It's when people start to feel crummy. Maybe they had an exposure. What I like to say,

277
0:28:03,600 --> 0:28:09,120
the time for monitoring and monoclonal is not the time for antibiotics. You know,

278
0:28:09,120 --> 0:28:15,040
we've had a lot of enthusiasm about convalescent plasma. And the article early convalescent plasma

279
0:28:15,040 --> 0:28:19,920
for high risk outpatients with COVID-19 was published this week in the New England Journal

280
0:28:19,920 --> 0:28:27,200
of Medicine. This is the siren three CPO study. And there were 511 patients enrolled in the trial,

281
0:28:27,200 --> 0:28:35,040
257 in the convalescent plasma group, 254 in the placebo group. The median age was 54.

282
0:28:35,040 --> 0:28:39,920
The median symptom duration was four days, right? So they're doing it the right way.

283
0:28:40,720 --> 0:28:47,120
The mean titer of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies was 1 to 641. So high titer

284
0:28:47,920 --> 0:28:53,840
neutralizing antibodies given early. Disease progression occurred pretty much the same,

285
0:28:53,840 --> 0:28:59,360
about 30% in people in the convalescent plasma group and in the placebo group. Now,

286
0:28:59,360 --> 0:29:05,760
five patients in the convalescent plasma group died, only one in the placebo group.

287
0:29:06,640 --> 0:29:11,520
Now comes regarding worst illness severity, hospital-free days, really similar in the two groups. So

288
0:29:12,320 --> 0:29:17,920
just another study, early administration of high titer convalescent plasma for the treatment of

289
0:29:17,920 --> 0:29:25,600
COVID-19 obtained from blood donors who recovered from the coronavirus disease 2019 was not helpful.

290
0:29:25,600 --> 0:29:32,400
I sort of want to leave that there. I know there's a lot of enthusiasm. We've done a lot of the

291
0:29:32,400 --> 0:29:37,760
science and the science does not support this intervention. Now, I am going to try to keep

292
0:29:37,760 --> 0:29:42,720
this short today. We have a few emails. So I'm going to wrap up here just with really a couple

293
0:29:42,720 --> 0:29:48,320
concluding thoughts. One is, as I continue to say, and we've bounced into this, no one is safe

294
0:29:48,320 --> 0:29:54,720
until everyone is safe. We really need to figure out what's going on with the global vaccination

295
0:29:54,720 --> 0:30:00,720
approach because it is falling flat. We are going to continue during the months of August,

296
0:30:00,720 --> 0:30:08,560
September and October, to support floating doctors. We're hoping to give them a donation up to $40,000

297
0:30:08,560 --> 0:30:14,480
to support their work down in Panama. We were able to get that support out to them, Rick,

298
0:30:14,480 --> 0:30:21,680
and got a nice thank you photo from my friends in Uganda, where there is not a lot of vaccines,

299
0:30:21,680 --> 0:30:27,200
where there is not a discussion of third doses. And so I want to thank all of our listeners for

300
0:30:27,200 --> 0:30:32,080
continuing to support us, continuing to go to parasites without borders to donate, and to help

301
0:30:32,080 --> 0:30:38,480
us with this work. Dan, you mentioned the Afghanistan situation. I assume nobody's getting vaccinated

302
0:30:38,480 --> 0:30:44,800
there at these days, right? It is a problem. It's a problem. Yeah. People are concerned about

303
0:30:44,800 --> 0:30:50,320
getting out, right? Yeah. I mean, it's really a humanitarian disaster we have right now,

304
0:30:50,320 --> 0:30:56,640
and vaccinations are certainly not part of that. Yeah. Time for some email questions for Daniel.

305
0:30:56,640 --> 0:31:03,360
You can send yours to Daniel at microbe.tv. We have one from Pear, who writes,

306
0:31:03,360 --> 0:31:08,800
my daughter is a kidney transplant recipient, has recently been through lymphoma,

307
0:31:08,800 --> 0:31:15,120
and barely has any B cells, thanks to retuximab. She's, however, on intravenous Ig therapy,

308
0:31:15,120 --> 0:31:19,440
and I'm wondering, would that now confer some level of immunity against COVID? I found a few

309
0:31:19,440 --> 0:31:25,120
papers commenting that there are common COVID antibodies in common IVIG, but I haven't been able

310
0:31:25,120 --> 0:31:30,880
to find any information about if they confer any level of real life protection. I guess,

311
0:31:30,880 --> 0:31:36,000
in an ideal world, she would be a recipient of monoclonal antibodies, but unfortunately,

312
0:31:36,000 --> 0:31:40,640
we don't live in the US and they're not available where we live. Yeah. So just to give our listeners

313
0:31:40,640 --> 0:31:45,120
maybe a little bit of background. So the whole concept here is this is an individual who cannot

314
0:31:45,120 --> 0:31:52,240
make their own immunoglobulins or own antibodies. And so the IVIG treatments periodically, you're

315
0:31:52,240 --> 0:31:58,800
giving this individual donated immunoglobulins from other individuals. Now, if those other

316
0:31:58,800 --> 0:32:03,600
individuals perhaps have been vaccinated, and we're starting to see this now, that people who are

317
0:32:03,600 --> 0:32:10,640
donating IVIG have been vaccinated, and in that IVIG are actually some of these protective antibodies

318
0:32:10,640 --> 0:32:16,320
generated by vaccination or maybe prior infection. So that's helpful. I don't think we'll end up

319
0:32:16,320 --> 0:32:22,640
doing like large scale studies, but a lot of the mechanism here just makes sense. The next thing

320
0:32:22,640 --> 0:32:29,280
that would make the most sense is these are individuals who, if they were in the right setting,

321
0:32:29,280 --> 0:32:32,960
could receive monoclonal antibodies. So that's being studied here in the US,

322
0:32:33,680 --> 0:32:39,040
that's an expensive option, but IVIG is not cheap. But yeah, I think you're thinking this

323
0:32:39,040 --> 0:32:46,560
through properly. Gene from London, by the way, discovered Twiv from your appearance on the Brian

324
0:32:46,560 --> 0:32:55,200
Lear podcast, Daniel. So that's great. And she says, I never use the B word or the words viral load,

325
0:32:55,200 --> 0:33:01,040
I distinguish infection from disease. So we're teaching them Daniel, that's great.

326
0:33:02,080 --> 0:33:07,200
But we did make a mistake. And it's actually my fault. And several people have pointed this out.

327
0:33:07,200 --> 0:33:12,160
I'd like to say it's carbon dioxide that we need to measure for indoor air quality

328
0:33:12,160 --> 0:33:18,080
relating to COVID. And I had said carbon monoxide, of course, carbon monoxide would also be a serious

329
0:33:18,080 --> 0:33:23,440
concern for air quality. I've implemented CO2 monitoring in my office as a proxy for

330
0:33:23,440 --> 0:33:28,720
understanding ventilation levels. It's part of our layered mitigations, which include vaccination

331
0:33:28,720 --> 0:33:35,840
masking hand and respiratory hygiene, reminding people to stay home if unwell. So that was my

332
0:33:35,840 --> 0:33:39,280
mistake. Because you had said, what are those monitors? And I said carbon monoxide and a bunch

333
0:33:39,280 --> 0:33:44,240
of people wrote in to say, no, no, no, it's carbon dioxide for that. Yeah, I don't know if you noticed

334
0:33:44,240 --> 0:33:48,240
Vincent from there on out, I just kept referring them as the monitors and not correcting it.

335
0:33:48,240 --> 0:33:52,880
Because you know, it's what you can correct me. It's no problem. Like how many people.

336
0:33:54,320 --> 0:34:01,760
I like what our listeners write in. All right. And the last one is Thomas, who's up in Alberta,

337
0:34:01,760 --> 0:34:07,120
Canada. I would like your thoughts on the anticoagulation issue you spoke about in the last

338
0:34:07,120 --> 0:34:11,200
clinical update where the one arm of the paper in New England Journal for critically ill patients

339
0:34:11,200 --> 0:34:17,200
showed no benefit with therapeutic anticoagulation. But the other arm, which wasn't highlighted in

340
0:34:17,200 --> 0:34:21,600
the update of non critically ill patients, which would be a large proportion of hospitalized patients

341
0:34:21,600 --> 0:34:28,960
did see benefit with therapeutic doses of LMWH. What is the standard of care for non critical

342
0:34:28,960 --> 0:34:34,000
COVID-19 hospitalized patients in your community as it relates to anticoagulation?

343
0:34:34,880 --> 0:34:40,480
Certainly. So the LMWH, that's low molecular weight heparid or anoxaparid is kind of the

344
0:34:40,480 --> 0:34:45,280
common one that we use. You know, there's there's a balance here. If you do nothing,

345
0:34:46,000 --> 0:34:52,400
people who have COVID-19 are at a higher risk of developing clotting complications,

346
0:34:52,400 --> 0:34:57,520
both venous and arterial. And I said on the American Society of Hematology,

347
0:34:57,520 --> 0:35:02,640
guidelines panel where we keep reviewing all the literature here. So I like to think that our

348
0:35:02,640 --> 0:35:08,960
treatment is sort of up with the literature. And the baseline recommendation across across the bat

349
0:35:08,960 --> 0:35:16,880
is anyone with COVID-19 who requires hospitalization and the associated immobility is put on prophylactic

350
0:35:16,880 --> 0:35:24,240
dosing anticoagulation. If you escalate that, okay, maybe you're going to have a reduction in the

351
0:35:24,240 --> 0:35:28,960
amount of clotting complications, but it is looking particularly as this study pointed out in critically

352
0:35:28,960 --> 0:35:33,360
ill patients that you're going to increase your risk of major bleeding. Now what is major bleeding?

353
0:35:33,360 --> 0:35:39,440
And that's tough. Is it a gastrointestinal bleed with about a 20 to 30% risk of death?

354
0:35:39,440 --> 0:35:45,280
Is it an intracranial bleed with the associated neurological impact? Is it a retroperitoneal

355
0:35:45,280 --> 0:35:50,880
bleed that we can transfuse through? So that that's really the balance here. So our standard

356
0:35:50,880 --> 0:35:57,440
is everyone comes in prophylactic dosing anticoagulation, vigilance to make sure that they don't have a

357
0:35:57,440 --> 0:36:02,880
clotting complication. And then sort of a case by case basis considering is there a reason to

358
0:36:02,880 --> 0:36:07,040
escalate in this individual? Daniel, what's on your bow tie today? I can't quite see it.

359
0:36:08,000 --> 0:36:16,160
So today is Clostridium difficile. Wow. So it's a gram negative. This is that antibiotic

360
0:36:16,160 --> 0:36:22,560
associated diarrhea from people using using too many antibiotics. I'm very happy that both

361
0:36:22,560 --> 0:36:31,200
ties represent all microbes. Try to be try to be an equal opportunity bow tie pathogen wearer.

362
0:36:31,200 --> 0:36:37,360
That's COVID-19 clinical update number 76 with Dr. Daniel Griffin. Thank you, Daniel.

363
0:36:37,360 --> 0:36:46,960
Oh, thank you. And everyone, including you Vincent, be safe.
