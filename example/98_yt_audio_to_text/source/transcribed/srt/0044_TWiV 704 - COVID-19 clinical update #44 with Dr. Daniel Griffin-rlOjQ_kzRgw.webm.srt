This week in virology, the podcast about viruses, the kind that make you sick.

2
0:00:10,320 --> 0:00:21,040
From MicrobeTV, this is Twiv. This week in virology, episode 704, recorded on January 7th, 2021.

3
0:00:21,600 --> 0:00:28,400
I'm Vincent Drackeniello, and you're listening to the podcast All About Viruses. Joining me today

4
0:00:28,400 --> 0:00:37,200
from New York, Daniel Griffin. Hello, everyone. Clinical update, 44, the first for 2021, Daniel.

5
0:00:38,240 --> 0:00:43,360
It is. It is. And I'm hoping that this is a better year. I was just going to say, Daniel,

6
0:00:43,360 --> 0:00:49,040
is this going to be a better year? Yes, it will be. Well, let me put it this way.

7
0:00:49,040 --> 0:00:57,760
Is it starting off in a better way? No, no, it is not. You know, it's sort of arbitrary,

8
0:00:57,760 --> 0:01:04,000
right that, you know, 2020 ended on a specific date, but the pandemic doesn't respect that.

9
0:01:05,040 --> 0:01:10,240
So yeah, I mean, so let me start with my quotation, and then we'll get right back to how bad things

10
0:01:10,240 --> 0:01:18,640
are. And maybe when I, as I read this, people recognize it. I will respect the hard one,

11
0:01:18,640 --> 0:01:25,360
hard one scientific gains of those physicians in whose steps I walk and gladly share such

12
0:01:25,360 --> 0:01:31,360
knowledge as is mine with those who are to follow. I will apply for the benefit of the sick,

13
0:01:31,360 --> 0:01:37,840
all measures that are required, avoiding those twin traps of overtreatment and therapeutic

14
0:01:37,840 --> 0:01:45,360
nihilism. I will remember that there is art to medicine, as well as science, and that warmth,

15
0:01:45,360 --> 0:01:51,120
sympathy, and understanding may outweigh the surgeon's knife or the chemist's drug.

16
0:01:51,120 --> 0:01:57,600
I will not be ashamed to say, I know not, nor will I fail to call in my colleagues when the

17
0:01:57,600 --> 0:02:04,000
skills of another are needed for a patient's recovery. I know what that is, and I'm not a doctor.

18
0:02:04,880 --> 0:02:11,440
And what is that? It's a Hippocratic oath. It is. Now, this is the modern version, and this was

19
0:02:11,440 --> 0:02:17,680
actually written in 1964 by Louis lasagna, the academic dean of the School of Medicine at Tuft.

20
0:02:17,680 --> 0:02:22,320
So it's updated. If people ever go back and read the original, it's a little interesting.

21
0:02:22,320 --> 0:02:27,440
It's not what we think of. So I wanted to throw that out there.

22
0:02:27,440 --> 0:02:31,200
Your background has changed a bit. I see some viral flowers, right?

23
0:02:32,480 --> 0:02:37,440
Yes. So this is actually a gift over, I guess, this shoulder, right? I'm backwards,

24
0:02:37,440 --> 0:02:40,400
so this shoulder. Let's see if I can see the show typing.

25
0:02:40,400 --> 0:02:48,160
Well, I'm trying to. But over my shoulder is a bouquet of pathogens.

26
0:02:48,800 --> 0:02:54,000
Wow. And this was actually created by my wife's youngest sister, Genevieve.

27
0:02:54,880 --> 0:03:02,080
And it's got there's the coronavirus that perhaps people recognize in there. There's HIV,

28
0:03:02,080 --> 0:03:10,240
there's syphilis, there's tuberculosis. We've got hercinia pestis. This is a whole bunch in there.

29
0:03:11,360 --> 0:03:12,560
I like it. I like it.

30
0:03:13,360 --> 0:03:16,800
Yeah, people are always wondering how I put the books up there, but I think the books have

31
0:03:16,800 --> 0:03:22,160
all fallen, right? They've all fallen off. It's a good thing. It's a good change for the new year,

32
0:03:22,160 --> 0:03:24,480
Daniel. Yeah, they're all on the floor.

33
0:03:24,480 --> 0:03:31,280
All right. So people probably know that things are tough.

34
0:03:32,320 --> 0:03:36,480
And it's really hard for us to take care of patients and provide the same level of care

35
0:03:36,480 --> 0:03:42,960
when numbers rise. The latest reports, I think people have probably heard, reminded me of a

36
0:03:42,960 --> 0:03:49,680
conversation that actually was rich, rich. And Alan, we're reaching out with words of advice,

37
0:03:49,680 --> 0:03:53,120
things to do. When we were running out of oxygen in New York, I don't know if people

38
0:03:53,120 --> 0:03:59,040
remember that. And I know Northwell has been in the press negative stuff lately.

39
0:03:59,760 --> 0:04:04,080
But one of the things that they did at some of our local hospitals is they really upgraded

40
0:04:04,080 --> 0:04:12,000
the oxygen system. So we have a lot of oxygen supply capacity that we did not have a year ago.

41
0:04:13,120 --> 0:04:17,440
And a lot of things that were happening a year ago, we were running out of oxygen. We were actually

42
0:04:17,440 --> 0:04:22,080
wheeling in mobile tanks to some of the rooms to keep up with the demands. We actually got to

43
0:04:22,080 --> 0:04:26,960
one point when we were discussing, we were going to reach out to the aviation industry,

44
0:04:26,960 --> 0:04:32,640
out to the airports. What can we do to get more oxygen? So right now, at least in New York,

45
0:04:32,640 --> 0:04:37,760
in some of the hospitals where I'm working, people thought ahead. And they actually, they put in

46
0:04:37,760 --> 0:04:43,680
the money, they upgraded the oxygen. And we're able to keep a lot of people off of ventilators,

47
0:04:43,680 --> 0:04:49,520
where we'll keep people's oxygen at a good level by doing a lot of high flow oxygen delivery

48
0:04:49,520 --> 0:04:55,360
techniques that we couldn't do before. But this requires a lot of attention. I sort of mentioned

49
0:04:55,360 --> 0:05:00,720
the art of medicine. There was a woman the other day, and the nurse was calling out,

50
0:05:00,720 --> 0:05:04,400
I need a doctor. And I went in and it was an older woman. It's actually one of the other

51
0:05:04,400 --> 0:05:10,640
infectious disease doctors, Dr. Fatima Johari was taking care of her and excellence. Nice to have

52
0:05:10,640 --> 0:05:17,760
the help of such high quality colleagues. But this woman had had the BIPAPON, which is somewhat

53
0:05:17,760 --> 0:05:23,040
suffocating. And she's an older woman and she's frightened and she feels ill and she's alone

54
0:05:23,040 --> 0:05:28,400
because of the isolation of the COVID. And it really was a question of me sitting there,

55
0:05:28,400 --> 0:05:33,200
holding her hand, getting her to take deep breaths, getting her to relax, getting her to

56
0:05:33,200 --> 0:05:40,000
allow the oxygen to stay on. We still need to do that. These are human beings. You can't just

57
0:05:40,000 --> 0:05:44,880
check off a box and walk out of the room and have systems and things take care of them. They

58
0:05:44,880 --> 0:05:51,200
need people at the bedside. So as the numbers rise, not only how are you supposed to hold the hand

59
0:05:51,840 --> 0:05:58,160
of a frightened woman with requiring oxygen and this claustrophobic feeling device

60
0:05:59,040 --> 0:06:02,880
when you've got so many other people. And as we're seeing sort of the horrors of LA,

61
0:06:03,920 --> 0:06:10,400
where they're telling the ambulances, conserve your oxygen. Because if the person requires too

62
0:06:10,400 --> 0:06:17,120
much oxygen, let's sort of triage. Don't bring them here. It's really, I have to say, kind of,

63
0:06:17,120 --> 0:06:22,480
well, it is very troubling just to say that. Numbers are bad here. One of the things that I

64
0:06:22,480 --> 0:06:30,800
point out, one thing that really was devastating in the first wave here in New York, about 50% of

65
0:06:30,800 --> 0:06:34,480
the deaths, about half of the people coming into the hospitals were coming in from nursing homes

66
0:06:34,480 --> 0:06:40,240
from group homes. We published on this. A lot of people have really, how do you keep those people

67
0:06:40,240 --> 0:06:46,000
safe? A lot of them died during the first wave. We're not really seeing those in the first wave.

68
0:06:46,640 --> 0:06:52,080
We had about say about 80 when we maxed out 80 community dwelling people with COVID. We're now

69
0:06:52,080 --> 0:06:57,760
up to about 90 or 100 community dwelling at one of the hospitals where I was actually this morning.

70
0:06:58,640 --> 0:07:03,200
So we're seeing more of the community, but we're not seeing those nursing home

71
0:07:03,200 --> 0:07:07,200
individuals. We're starting to get vaccinated or keep them safe. There's testing other measures.

72
0:07:07,200 --> 0:07:15,840
We're not sending infected infectious people into those settings. So, yeah, I think we, well,

73
0:07:15,840 --> 0:07:22,320
we're going to probably pass 4,000 deaths per day this month, but we were pretty darn close

74
0:07:22,320 --> 0:07:26,640
yesterday. We'll see what the numbers are today. So things are not going well.

75
0:07:27,440 --> 0:07:34,000
Now, why did I start off with the Hippocratic oath? It's because I wanted to sort of bring us

76
0:07:34,000 --> 0:07:41,600
back to I think the paradigms I talked about, the evidence, the vehemence, the eloquence,

77
0:07:41,600 --> 0:07:46,240
the diffidence, the nervousness, and then the evidence-based medicine. But I also want to

78
0:07:46,240 --> 0:07:52,320
throw a second thing in that I think people will maybe sort of think about and maybe they started

79
0:07:52,320 --> 0:07:58,000
to already get this flavor as I talk. There's actually two splits that I'm going to say in practice

80
0:07:58,000 --> 0:08:05,760
style. One is derived from Hippocratic philosophy, but as you'll, as you may have noticed, it was

81
0:08:05,760 --> 0:08:14,800
not in the oath. And this is the first do no harm, the premium known nocere. And that's really this

82
0:08:14,800 --> 0:08:20,640
idea of don't do something unless you know it's going to make a difference. And there's a second

83
0:08:20,640 --> 0:08:26,240
style that I want to be respectful of, which is if we think something can help, let's go ahead and

84
0:08:26,240 --> 0:08:32,720
try it. Now, I'll say in calmer times, the less is more that do not treat your patients with

85
0:08:32,720 --> 0:08:37,920
untested therapeutics has been more of a common approach. It's definitely been more of the academic

86
0:08:37,920 --> 0:08:44,000
approach. This is the philosophy behind having an FDA restricting the use of prescription medications

87
0:08:44,000 --> 0:08:48,960
to highly trained licensed professionals. You certainly wouldn't take anything off the bench,

88
0:08:48,960 --> 0:08:54,480
no concoction, no nothing that you think would work and then put it into a patient without doing

89
0:08:54,480 --> 0:08:59,200
safety and other trials. But there's a gray area, a lot of the medicines that we use, we've been

90
0:08:59,200 --> 0:09:05,680
using for many, many years, but never really actually doing those randomized control trials

91
0:09:05,680 --> 0:09:12,720
that we sort of have required or said are the gold standard. And I clearly, right, I clearly am,

92
0:09:12,720 --> 0:09:17,360
you know, of the school where I respect the randomized control trials. But I just wanted to

93
0:09:17,360 --> 0:09:22,000
point out there's there's two different styles here. I learned from actually watching both

94
0:09:22,000 --> 0:09:26,400
styles. There certainly are a lot of individuals that try things at the bedside and I watched that

95
0:09:26,400 --> 0:09:31,200
and learned from it. And sometimes this actually leads to us going ahead and doing those randomized

96
0:09:31,200 --> 0:09:38,400
control trials. So all right, just wanted to throw that out as we started, because we have some we

97
0:09:38,400 --> 0:09:44,960
have some new information. And I'm going to jump into the lot of vaccination arms here.

98
0:09:44,960 --> 0:09:51,040
So one thing I want to talk about is passive vaccination. And what are the two types of

99
0:09:51,040 --> 0:09:55,040
passive vaccination that we know about? Well, I'm going to get to monoclonal antibodies,

100
0:09:55,040 --> 0:10:01,680
but we had a study out of Argentina funded by the Gates Foundation, early high titer plasma

101
0:10:01,680 --> 0:10:07,440
therapy to prevent severe COVID-19 in older adults. This was just published in the New England Journal

102
0:10:07,440 --> 0:10:13,280
of Medicine. And I want to say this, this was done the way I think going back to March, April,

103
0:10:14,480 --> 0:10:18,560
convalescent plasma should have been studied. What they did is they actually,

104
0:10:18,560 --> 0:10:26,000
they took convalescent plasma, they identified convalescent plasma that had high titer neutralizing

105
0:10:26,000 --> 0:10:32,160
antibodies, and they gave it early. They gave it within the first 72 hours. So this was a randomized

106
0:10:32,160 --> 0:10:39,360
double blind placebo control trial of convalescent plasma with high IgG tighters neutralizing

107
0:10:39,360 --> 0:10:45,600
antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome, coronavirus two, SARS-CoV-2, in older

108
0:10:45,600 --> 0:10:52,480
adults given within 72 hours of the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. So they're still in that first week,

109
0:10:52,480 --> 0:10:59,440
they're in that critical viral replication window. 160 patients underwent randomization.

110
0:11:00,800 --> 0:11:08,240
A severe disease developed 16%. People that convalescent plasma, 31% in people that got placebo.

111
0:11:08,240 --> 0:11:14,560
So a relative risk reduction, basically about by half, about 50%. And they didn't see any

112
0:11:14,560 --> 0:11:20,320
significant adverse events, which makes sense. You're giving this to healthy outpatient people

113
0:11:20,320 --> 0:11:27,760
that have not gone into the second, the inflammatory phase. So I think this finally builds on trends

114
0:11:27,760 --> 0:11:34,240
that we saw on a lot of other trials. The idea that high tighters neutralizing antibodies given

115
0:11:34,240 --> 0:11:40,400
in the appropriate window, not giving it late, all the issues that we saw there. So hopefully,

116
0:11:40,400 --> 0:11:46,640
this is going to guide people who are looking at using convalescent plasma. And many parts of

117
0:11:46,640 --> 0:11:52,960
the world, the monoclonal's I'm about to talk about, may not be available. We talk about convalescent

118
0:11:52,960 --> 0:12:00,160
plasma being a resource intensive therapy, but it's not quite as expensive as the monoclonal

119
0:12:00,160 --> 0:12:07,440
antibodies. So let's go into the next, the next passive vaccination area. And I have some, I'll say

120
0:12:07,440 --> 0:12:14,080
really, I think, positive developments here. So bam, linibomav, that's really the monoclonal

121
0:12:14,080 --> 0:12:20,880
antibody that we're being used the most. That's the Eli Lilly product, the Regeneron product,

122
0:12:20,880 --> 0:12:28,960
also has EUA, doesn't quite got as much attention. But the Mayo Clinic, which is treated over 2000

123
0:12:28,960 --> 0:12:34,480
patients, and Houston Methodist, which is treated over 1000, they're doing about 70 patients a day

124
0:12:34,480 --> 0:12:40,080
there, they shared their experience, right? So a lot of clinicians were concerned about monoclonals

125
0:12:40,080 --> 0:12:46,320
got EUA with just looking at 100, 200 folks, a little over 200 folks in those, each of those trials.

126
0:12:46,320 --> 0:12:50,400
And so people were saying, you know, how can you, how can you really go ahead and make this

127
0:12:50,400 --> 0:12:56,080
standard of care without more experience? So now we've had thousands of people, a post EUA

128
0:12:56,080 --> 0:13:02,880
experience, not in a formal trial. And here the reports were very similar safety profile,

129
0:13:02,880 --> 0:13:08,240
actually went over this with the people at Eli Lilly about a week ago. And that's what

130
0:13:08,240 --> 0:13:14,880
we're seeing at the Mayo in Houston, and about a 70% reduction in people progressing to require

131
0:13:14,880 --> 0:13:22,640
any hospital level care, any oxygen, any ER visits. So I look at this, I say, this is pretty impressive.

132
0:13:22,640 --> 0:13:28,800
Here is a therapy, you know, steroids, what 2% mortality benefit. Here's a therapy that if you

133
0:13:28,800 --> 0:13:36,560
give this to people in the first week of illness, sort of earlier, the better, a 75% reduction in

134
0:13:36,560 --> 0:13:41,120
those people going on to require any medical care, keeping these people out of the hospital.

135
0:13:41,920 --> 0:13:47,120
And the Mayo people actually suggested that they were starting to see evidence of decreased

136
0:13:47,120 --> 0:13:52,080
mortality, and actually suggesting that will this will eventually lead to a peer reviewed

137
0:13:52,080 --> 0:13:57,760
publication. So I think that's exciting. And I'll sort of throw in here, you know,

138
0:13:57,760 --> 0:14:02,720
the issue that we've seen across the board, it's just like the vaccines, only 20, 30% of the doses

139
0:14:02,720 --> 0:14:07,440
are getting to people, the rest of them are sitting there. We just opened up our United in

140
0:14:07,440 --> 0:14:13,120
research. So I'm going to be doing a it actually be a trial. So 7,500 individuals will get BAM

141
0:14:13,120 --> 0:14:19,920
linibimab, and we'll actually get more data. So really understand the timing, the safety profile,

142
0:14:19,920 --> 0:14:26,560
and the efficacy of these therapeutics. So find out, you know, and look into this more and make

143
0:14:26,560 --> 0:14:30,160
sure that this is something that if you feel like it's appropriate for your patients, you know how

144
0:14:30,160 --> 0:14:35,200
to access the programs. All right, the early inflammatory phase, right? I've sort of skipped

145
0:14:35,200 --> 0:14:40,160
right over the vaccines, but let me let me throw it in here before we get there. I mean, the whole

146
0:14:40,160 --> 0:14:45,280
idea, right, is to keep people from even getting to this point. And the vaccine rollout has been

147
0:14:46,160 --> 0:14:52,160
incredibly frustrating. I think that people have heard about this. You know, only 20 to 30% of

148
0:14:52,160 --> 0:14:56,720
the vaccines that have been distributed have gotten in people's arms. It's having a conversation

149
0:14:56,720 --> 0:15:02,800
with today about, you know, the latest sort of, I guess, instead of asking how can we help, it's,

150
0:15:02,800 --> 0:15:07,520
we will punish you if you don't do a better job. I'm not sure that's helpful. We shared some of

151
0:15:07,520 --> 0:15:11,920
the experience about when pro health received the vaccines, how basically by the end of the next

152
0:15:11,920 --> 0:15:17,920
day, 90% of those were in people's arms. But I have to say, this was not easy. We were told that

153
0:15:17,920 --> 0:15:23,360
eventually we were getting vaccines. The vaccines arrived. That's how I knew they were coming. No

154
0:15:23,360 --> 0:15:27,120
one picked up a phone the day before to say they're in the mail. They'll be there tomorrow. They're

155
0:15:27,120 --> 0:15:31,760
being shipped. I mean, I'm sure that will occurred. But it was really it was Tuesday, 1200 vaccines

156
0:15:31,760 --> 0:15:37,520
just showed up. And then we were basically trying to get those in arms. You know, it was the week

157
0:15:37,520 --> 0:15:42,800
after Christmas. A lot of people are on vacation. It's a challenge. You know, I think we need to

158
0:15:42,800 --> 0:15:48,400
do a better job. We've really cut the departments of health out of the equation here. And this is

159
0:15:48,400 --> 0:15:53,280
what they do. They were ready. They were ramped up and ready to go. So we need to do a better job

160
0:15:53,280 --> 0:15:58,480
there. I'm just going to sort of leave that. But you know, if people are listening, you know,

161
0:15:58,480 --> 0:16:03,440
we we all want to do a better job. The hospitals are not, you know, failing to vaccinate on purpose.

162
0:16:04,160 --> 0:16:08,240
You know, instead of governors reaching out and saying we're going to find you, why don't they

163
0:16:08,240 --> 0:16:14,240
reach out and say, how can we help make this happen? Are there HIPAA issues? Is there red tape in the

164
0:16:14,240 --> 0:16:19,040
way? Are there, do you need, you know, issues you need help getting, you know, IT stuff uploaded?

165
0:16:19,040 --> 0:16:23,120
What do you need? Let's make it happen. Because I'm sure there's some IT workers and other folks

166
0:16:23,120 --> 0:16:28,160
out there who are ready to help just. So I'm sort of my request changed the paradigm if you can.

167
0:16:28,160 --> 0:16:33,520
And maybe all our listeners can help push that forward. The early inflammatory phase,

168
0:16:33,520 --> 0:16:38,080
I mentioned before, we're running out of oxygen. What do we have? Well, we do have remdesivir.

169
0:16:38,080 --> 0:16:42,480
And a little subtle change here. I don't think any of us have gotten more and more excited about

170
0:16:42,480 --> 0:16:47,520
efficacy. But there have been several studies now saying like you don't really have to worry

171
0:16:47,520 --> 0:16:52,240
about renal function. This is being given to people with end stage real disease, people on

172
0:16:52,240 --> 0:16:57,840
dialysis. It looks like it's safe in people with renal disease. It looks like it's tolerated in

173
0:16:57,840 --> 0:17:03,760
people that have pretty significant LFT abnormalities up to 10 times upper limit of normal.

174
0:17:03,760 --> 0:17:09,760
So at this point, I'm not saying we have any more efficacy data. I'm just saying that we can we

175
0:17:09,760 --> 0:17:16,640
no longer have to not give it if there's a renal function issue or LFT issues. The other, and you

176
0:17:16,640 --> 0:17:22,960
know, I'm going to tell people they should listen to a TWIB 703 Vincent. Because I think you did a

177
0:17:22,960 --> 0:17:27,920
great job. The group did a great job. I was going to spend a little time talking about CT values,

178
0:17:27,920 --> 0:17:33,280
and I'm just going to talk a little bit about CT values. Not all our hospitals, as I mentioned,

179
0:17:33,280 --> 0:17:37,120
have access to this. Some of the machines don't give CT values. They just you know, you could

180
0:17:37,120 --> 0:17:41,920
save a little money and buy a yes or no machine. But there were some interesting studies that

181
0:17:41,920 --> 0:17:47,520
came out that were talked about. And one of the things is that someone comes in and timing again

182
0:17:47,520 --> 0:17:53,440
matters. We're not looking at peak level of virus. We're saying seven days out, we're saying the time

183
0:17:53,440 --> 0:17:58,640
at which someone de-compensates and someone shows up at the hospital if the people have a very high

184
0:17:58,640 --> 0:18:03,360
level of virus at that point. And they have yet to mount an antibody response when they're sick

185
0:18:03,360 --> 0:18:09,040
enough to require hospitalization. Those people are much more likely to die. And we're looking at

186
0:18:09,040 --> 0:18:17,520
a patient today in the ICU who I do not expect to survive. You know, who came in with the PCR

187
0:18:17,520 --> 0:18:25,120
positive. You know, it was into the second week, antibodies had not developed yet. These are people

188
0:18:25,120 --> 0:18:30,560
that are not doing well. How does that help us clinically? I don't know if it does. I mean,

189
0:18:30,560 --> 0:18:34,320
some of the things we've seen is that people that are going to do poorly tend to de-compensate

190
0:18:34,320 --> 0:18:39,200
earlier. So some of my discussions were, well, it makes sense. The virus is still high because

191
0:18:39,200 --> 0:18:45,520
they're coming in earlier. You come in at day 14. I expect a lower viral level. I also expect

192
0:18:45,520 --> 0:18:50,480
there to be enough time for the antibodies to develop. So we'll learn more about that. But

193
0:18:50,480 --> 0:18:55,120
this is potentially now that we're talking about CT values, something that's going to help us

194
0:18:55,120 --> 0:19:00,160
on the tail end. You know, I do a lot of consulting enough. People know about this for the entertainment

195
0:19:00,160 --> 0:19:07,840
industry and sports. And I had always been a zero tolerance. But now with CT values, we actually

196
0:19:07,840 --> 0:19:12,640
had a discussion that if that if both CT values, right, because there's often two primers, that's

197
0:19:12,640 --> 0:19:19,040
if both CT values are greater than 34, and the person has been well for more than, we'll say,

198
0:19:19,040 --> 0:19:24,560
20 days to be conservative. I really think that that may actually be reasonable for us to start

199
0:19:24,560 --> 0:19:30,160
looking at, well, at least for me to start loosening up my zero tolerance for some of those settings.

200
0:19:30,160 --> 0:19:34,080
Secondary infection phase, you know, there was a there was a morning conference,

201
0:19:34,080 --> 0:19:37,760
Tuesday morning conference at Columbia. And first, it was the pulmonologist. Then it was the

202
0:19:37,760 --> 0:19:43,360
infectious disease physicians. And they were doing some case reports. And it was a discussion

203
0:19:43,360 --> 0:19:51,680
about invasive pulmonary infections. So aspergillosis, that's one of our molds that we worry about.

204
0:19:51,680 --> 0:19:56,320
And it's interesting. I've seen several studies and I always hate when they throw in, you know,

205
0:19:56,320 --> 0:20:02,880
the word the judgmental word low or high. And there was a recent publication occurrence of

206
0:20:02,880 --> 0:20:09,040
invasive pulmonary fungal infections in severe COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU. And they

207
0:20:09,040 --> 0:20:15,600
said we have seen very few only 4.8% of our patients have a fungal infection. Well, one in 20, I'm not

208
0:20:15,600 --> 0:20:23,200
sure I would say very few other series have suggested higher. We have not seen that many in

209
0:20:23,200 --> 0:20:29,040
the hospitals where I have worked, we have seen some. But this just when you're in that secondary

210
0:20:29,040 --> 0:20:34,160
infection phase, just not only we worried about bacterial infections, not only we've seen more

211
0:20:34,160 --> 0:20:39,760
and more multi drug resistant bacterial infections. So you put them on what we thought was broad

212
0:20:39,760 --> 0:20:44,400
spectrum antibiotics. And actually it's ineffective because of the rising rates from the antibiotic

213
0:20:44,400 --> 0:20:50,240
overuse. But you also have to be thinking about fungal infections as well. So discussion about

214
0:20:50,240 --> 0:20:56,880
sending off the fun to tell the Aspergillus galactamanin serum test as well as BAL

215
0:20:57,680 --> 0:21:03,040
specimens to try to sort all this out. Got a very interesting call today, which hopefully I'll get

216
0:21:03,040 --> 0:21:09,440
more development on going forward, but an individual at one of our local hospitals,

217
0:21:09,440 --> 0:21:17,120
who sounds like he is being admitted with a multi system inflammatory syndrome in an adult

218
0:21:17,120 --> 0:21:22,720
gentleman in his late 30s. I'm also concerned that this person may actually have a stronger

219
0:21:22,720 --> 0:21:27,680
ladies hyper infection as well. So we'll get some interesting things there. But that's just

220
0:21:27,680 --> 0:21:34,000
something that we see often people leave the hospital, and then they come back in week three

221
0:21:34,000 --> 0:21:39,920
or four with just, you know, sky high ferritins, D dimers, massive amounts of inflammation.

222
0:21:40,720 --> 0:21:45,760
And the challenge to sort out is this someone that you treat with IVIG and steroids,

223
0:21:45,760 --> 0:21:51,440
or is this someone who has a massive infection? So there's sort of this overlap here. You want

224
0:21:51,440 --> 0:21:58,000
to try to somehow make a really tough decision here. And we're working with the CDC and the

225
0:21:58,000 --> 0:22:03,520
physicians there. So hopefully that'll end up with a positive outcome in this young gentleman.

226
0:22:03,520 --> 0:22:08,880
The other thing that I want to close on is to talk about long COVID. And I make sure I always

227
0:22:08,880 --> 0:22:12,960
talk about this. I've been doing that since I think about April. And there was a there was

228
0:22:12,960 --> 0:22:18,960
a recent study cognitive deficits in people who have recovered from COVID-19 relative to controls.

229
0:22:18,960 --> 0:22:27,200
And this looked at over 84,000 individuals. So what I really enjoyed about this is the fact that

230
0:22:27,200 --> 0:22:32,720
you were able to see that the severity of disease was predictive of the severity of the cognitive

231
0:22:32,720 --> 0:22:40,400
deficits, people who were sick enough that they ended up on a ventilator. The cognitive impact

232
0:22:40,400 --> 0:22:47,760
in them was basically equivalent of about being 10 years older, having an IQ drop of about 8.5.

233
0:22:47,760 --> 0:22:54,640
But on specific testing, you were seeing cognitive deficits, even in people that had mild

234
0:22:54,640 --> 0:23:00,080
outpatient disease, not quite as severe. So the severity of your disease, whether or not you have

235
0:23:00,080 --> 0:23:06,720
significant respiratory symptoms early on, significant amount of oxygen support, whether or not you're

236
0:23:06,720 --> 0:23:13,440
ventilated. So the sicker you are, not only the higher likelihood you have of getting long-term

237
0:23:13,440 --> 0:23:21,520
cognitive deficits, but also predictive of more severe cognitive deficits, a little more data on

238
0:23:21,520 --> 0:23:28,640
the loss of taste and smell. We're actually seeing about 86% of people by six months are

239
0:23:28,640 --> 0:23:35,040
getting their taste and smell back. That means about 14, 15% of people six months out still are

240
0:23:35,040 --> 0:23:39,760
chewing on cardboard. So we'll end it there. I want to try to keep it a little short today.

241
0:23:39,760 --> 0:23:45,040
And ask you to continue to come to parasites without borders and help us support the P-score,

242
0:23:45,040 --> 0:23:50,080
their HIV and AIDS programs. I just want to point out, we're immersed in COVID, we're drowning in

243
0:23:50,080 --> 0:23:56,000
COVID, but when we come out the other side of this, we have so many other issues and we're hoping to

244
0:23:56,000 --> 0:24:01,840
be here to help educate and support all these other causes. All right, Dan, three quick questions.

245
0:24:01,840 --> 0:24:10,560
One is from Dr. O'Brien who writes about your update on the use of Bambam. In the first week to

246
0:24:10,560 --> 0:24:15,840
lower the incidence of hospitalization, when I reached out to our local hospital officials,

247
0:24:15,840 --> 0:24:20,000
they seem to be limiting this treatment to very high-risk patients. Could you give us further

248
0:24:20,000 --> 0:24:25,200
information about the specific criteria for emergency use of this drug? My staff members seem

249
0:24:25,200 --> 0:24:30,560
quite sick at home, but do not meet the criteria set forth by the hospital. It seems to me that

250
0:24:30,560 --> 0:24:35,280
Bambam might be beneficial in a much wider group of patients sick with COVID-19.

251
0:24:35,280 --> 0:24:41,600
Yeah, so I shared this. This is like the vaccines. We've made it so hard to access things that no

252
0:24:41,600 --> 0:24:46,400
one gets them, so they sit there on the shelf. Some of the hospitals, I'll say in Minnesota,

253
0:24:46,400 --> 0:24:50,640
for instance, the experience I had there was that they're basically trying to give out as much

254
0:24:50,640 --> 0:24:57,200
per day as is coming in, so it's not just sitting there. So they will first target the people that

255
0:24:57,200 --> 0:25:03,280
are highest-risk, so that would be people who have a 10% or higher likelihood of ending up in the

256
0:25:03,280 --> 0:25:10,240
hospital. So this would be individuals who are 65 and older, 55 plus a certain list of comorbidities.

257
0:25:10,240 --> 0:25:16,320
There is a Bambalinibimab FDA-FACT sheet, which is available online to look at. I glance at it,

258
0:25:16,320 --> 0:25:22,800
because the third category is very complicated. It's any of the following, and it's a long list

259
0:25:22,800 --> 0:25:28,960
of severe diseases, which significantly increase your chance of ending up in the hospital.

260
0:25:30,000 --> 0:25:34,480
So they go through that triage. I think it makes sense. I mean, this is a therapy that

261
0:25:35,120 --> 0:25:40,560
the reason it has E-way for the 10% or higher risk of hospitalization is that's where it makes

262
0:25:40,560 --> 0:25:46,080
sense. But it would seem to me, rather than letting it sit on the shelf, it is probably

263
0:25:46,080 --> 0:25:50,320
beneficial in people beyond that group. And I've actually seen people outside of that group get

264
0:25:50,320 --> 0:25:54,640
it very quickly bounce back quicker than we would expect with the natural history.

265
0:25:55,280 --> 0:25:59,520
But then again, you know, as I started off with my evidence-based medicine,

266
0:25:59,520 --> 0:26:04,320
that population was not specifically studied. So you're stretching it a little bit,

267
0:26:04,320 --> 0:26:09,440
but it tends to be a very safe therapy. As we move forward with more studies,

268
0:26:09,440 --> 0:26:13,440
hopefully the use of this will expand. All right. The next email is from

269
0:26:13,440 --> 0:26:20,560
Allen, who writes about his wife who has severe asthma. And some years ago, in preparation for

270
0:26:20,560 --> 0:26:28,160
a chest x-ray, she was given intravenous iodine contrast, and she went into anaphylactic shock.

271
0:26:28,160 --> 0:26:34,400
And they had no idea that she was allergic to this contrast agent. So he asks, how are we

272
0:26:34,400 --> 0:26:37,840
supposed to know if we were allergic to any of the ingredients in the vaccine? If there are a

273
0:26:37,840 --> 0:26:43,360
bunch of compounds that we have no clue about, more specifically, are any also found in iodine

274
0:26:43,360 --> 0:26:51,280
contrast? Yeah. So this is an excellent question. When the MMWR just came out with a recent

275
0:26:52,000 --> 0:27:00,800
report on the side effects seen with the vaccines and reported about 1 in 100,000 people are having

276
0:27:00,800 --> 0:27:08,640
an anaphylactic reaction. So that means 11.1 people and the first million that got vaccines.

277
0:27:08,640 --> 0:27:15,600
These people were treated with beta drill, some of them received epinephrine, and then all recovered.

278
0:27:15,600 --> 0:27:24,720
So this is not a vaccine that has zero risks. It is an effective agent. So there is this.

279
0:27:24,720 --> 0:27:31,360
But who had those reactions? The initial recommendation, the current recommendation is someone who's had

280
0:27:31,360 --> 0:27:36,400
a prior significant vaccine reaction, and that would be an anaphylactic reaction to a vaccine.

281
0:27:36,400 --> 0:27:41,680
Someone you'd have heightened concerned about. It's not a food allergy. It's not an iodine

282
0:27:41,680 --> 0:27:48,000
allergy. I'm doing a talk for an allergy group next week. There is a paper that came out that was

283
0:27:48,000 --> 0:27:56,320
actually published by a group out of Harvard looking at PEG 2000, polyethylene glycol. The idea is

284
0:27:56,320 --> 0:28:03,680
that maybe what is triggering these immune reactions, these anaphylactic reactions, and there is some

285
0:28:03,680 --> 0:28:08,720
investigation into trying to figure out if there's some way to do maybe skin testing to figure out

286
0:28:08,720 --> 0:28:14,960
who that 1 in 100,000 person is. I have to say the way I weigh in on this is the recommendation

287
0:28:14,960 --> 0:28:21,600
is all the sites giving vaccine vaccinations should have a vaccination reaction kit,

288
0:28:21,600 --> 0:28:26,880
which involves beta drill. The epinephrine, which was to have enough for three people

289
0:28:26,880 --> 0:28:35,360
at each site, also intravenous formulations of the anhistamine as well as the oral and

290
0:28:35,360 --> 0:28:42,400
femotidine, so intravenous other, sort of H2 blockers, and the ability basically to get

291
0:28:42,400 --> 0:28:47,360
someone to a higher level of care as needed. We're talking about a million people vaccinated

292
0:28:47,360 --> 0:28:52,560
10 reactions. It's actually quite uncommon, but you need to be ready for those because again,

293
0:28:52,560 --> 0:28:58,320
if you have this reaction, you have this reaction. Our last question is from Laura who writes about

294
0:28:58,320 --> 0:29:03,840
her 66-year-old mother who was recently updating her advanced medical directive and included a

295
0:29:03,840 --> 0:29:08,800
note saying if she were to contract COVID-19, she does not want to be placed on a ventilator,

296
0:29:08,800 --> 0:29:13,360
as she believes she would be unlikely to survive and regain the ability to live a full

297
0:29:13,360 --> 0:29:17,680
independent life. I did a quick search to see if I could find any literature on long-term

298
0:29:17,680 --> 0:29:24,160
outcomes for COVID-19 patients on ventilators and have found one study considering whether

299
0:29:24,160 --> 0:29:30,000
patients would survive to discharge but no other endpoints. I'd appreciate your insights on longer-term

300
0:29:30,000 --> 0:29:35,280
outcomes for ventilated patients, either from the literature or if research on the subject has not

301
0:29:35,280 --> 0:29:41,760
been published, your impressions from your own patient population. Yeah, so our own patient

302
0:29:41,760 --> 0:29:48,800
experiences were actually published. Early on, you saw data out of New York Presbyterian, so

303
0:29:48,800 --> 0:29:53,920
Columbia, you saw data out of NYU, you saw data experienced at Northwell, so the different hospitals

304
0:29:53,920 --> 0:29:59,200
where I see patients. The initial experience was that people who ended up on the ventilator,

305
0:29:59,200 --> 0:30:04,640
the early experience was the last single-digit survival that they got up to 15% survival,

306
0:30:04,640 --> 0:30:13,200
but consistently people who went up on ventilators have a very poor prognosis. They have a limited

307
0:30:13,200 --> 0:30:20,000
chance of surviving, so it continues to be as much as possible to try to keep people off the

308
0:30:20,000 --> 0:30:24,720
ventilators. Our experience, which I think is consistent with the literature, is once you get

309
0:30:24,720 --> 0:30:30,560
on the ventilator, you're probably not going to survive. I say probably, but again, each individual

310
0:30:30,560 --> 0:30:36,080
case, so people make these advanced directives, but you want to look at the whole picture. What's

311
0:30:36,080 --> 0:30:40,880
the age in the individual? What are the comorbidities? Now we've talked a little bit about the ability

312
0:30:40,880 --> 0:30:46,640
to look at viral levels and antibodies and inflammatory markers and neutrophil lymphocyte ratios,

313
0:30:46,640 --> 0:30:52,480
so you can even make this more customized to an individual. That's potentially another way

314
0:30:52,480 --> 0:31:00,160
to nuance it to look and talk to your mom's health care provider about specifically for her,

315
0:31:00,160 --> 0:31:06,640
which is really what it is. At this age, maybe this is one of the people that would survive and

316
0:31:06,640 --> 0:31:10,800
come off the ventilator, so you want to have those discussions to make sure that, as we say,

317
0:31:10,800 --> 0:31:17,680
your goals of care are consistent with the treatments. Daniel, if you do survive after a ventilator,

318
0:31:17,680 --> 0:31:25,440
do you have any long-term issues? In most cases, I think we're seeing yes. As I discussed today,

319
0:31:25,440 --> 0:31:32,880
high incidence of about a 10-point IQ hit on average, you're seeing long-term disability.

320
0:31:33,920 --> 0:31:37,200
People who survive, and I think this is really important for pillage matter,

321
0:31:37,200 --> 0:31:41,840
just surviving COVID doesn't mean you bounce back to 100%. A lot of times, it means now you're going

322
0:31:41,840 --> 0:31:51,280
to have significant mortality. That's COVID-19, clinical update number 44 with Dr. Daniel Griffin.

323
0:31:51,280 --> 0:31:56,000
Thanks, Daniel. Oh, thank you so much. Thank you, everyone. If you can push,

324
0:31:56,000 --> 0:32:25,840
help us get those vaccines into arms. Thank you so much.
