0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:06,880
This week in virology, the podcast about viruses, the kind that make you sick.

2
0:00:10,320 --> 0:00:20,640
From Microbe TV, this is Twiv, this week in virology, episode 764, recorded on June 3, 2021.

3
0:00:21,440 --> 0:00:26,800
I'm Vincent Rackeniello, and you're listening to the podcast all about viruses. Joining me

4
0:00:26,800 --> 0:00:31,440
today from New York, Daniel Griffin. Hello, everyone.

5
0:00:32,480 --> 0:00:38,000
Well, Daniel, last time I think I asked you when the pandemic would be over. Now I understand Tony

6
0:00:38,000 --> 0:00:49,600
Fauci says July. How about that? Oh, yeah. I can't, I don't believe it because we're not going to

7
0:00:49,600 --> 0:00:56,400
hit the level of immunity. What do you think? I worry about that question for several reasons.

8
0:00:57,440 --> 0:01:04,000
One, I've sort of been, every so often I go on social media. And when that question has been

9
0:01:04,000 --> 0:01:10,880
bantered about somebody replied back with which pandemic, right, pointing out that the age and

10
0:01:10,880 --> 0:01:18,400
the age pandemic is going strong. And then there really is, and I think that really goes in line

11
0:01:18,400 --> 0:01:23,200
with the fact that there's this real narrow focus people might have the pandemic over in New York

12
0:01:23,200 --> 0:01:30,000
City. Is it over in the United States? Is it over in the world? And well, the HIV AIDS pandemic

13
0:01:30,000 --> 0:01:37,040
is not over in New York City or nor the world. I do think, and we'll talk about this, that rates

14
0:01:37,040 --> 0:01:41,360
are going to get pretty darn low in July and August here in the US. But if you look around

15
0:01:41,360 --> 0:01:46,640
the world, this pandemic is far from over. That's right, absolutely.

16
0:01:46,640 --> 0:01:51,040
All right, let's start with our quotation. I was thinking of you when I picked out this

17
0:01:51,040 --> 0:01:56,960
quotation, Vincent. If you set out to be liked, you would be prepared to compromise on anything

18
0:01:56,960 --> 0:02:02,640
at any time, and you would achieve nothing. And that was Margaret Thatcher. I've just noticed a

19
0:02:02,640 --> 0:02:07,920
lot of the recent twibs have discussed the viral origins, and I'm sure you're getting

20
0:02:07,920 --> 0:02:12,240
wonderful, loving emails in response from all the people that agree with you. And even the ones

21
0:02:12,240 --> 0:02:18,880
that don't, I'm sure it's very civil discourse. Right, you got it.

22
0:02:18,880 --> 0:02:24,400
So all right, let's things here in the US said, you know, I'm going to say, I'm going to use the

23
0:02:24,400 --> 0:02:28,720
word pessimism and optimism here. But I always prefer the truth, right? People say, Oh, I just

24
0:02:28,720 --> 0:02:33,600
want to look on the bright. I want to actually know the truth. And there were a lot of people

25
0:02:33,600 --> 0:02:38,000
with predictive models about where we were headed and one of the predictive models or the

26
0:02:38,000 --> 0:02:44,880
pessimistic model. This was June 1st, the article association of simulated COVID-19

27
0:02:44,880 --> 0:02:51,840
vaccination and non-pharmaceutical interventions with infections, hospitalizations, and mortality.

28
0:02:52,480 --> 0:02:59,040
That was published in JAMA Network Open. And here the authors report on a number of simulations

29
0:02:59,760 --> 0:03:06,880
that they were suggesting supported the idea that if we removed mass all these non-pharmaceutical

30
0:03:06,880 --> 0:03:12,800
interventions while the vaccines were being distributed, before we got to a high level,

31
0:03:12,800 --> 0:03:18,880
that we would see substantial increases in infections, hospitalizations, deaths, we're not

32
0:03:18,880 --> 0:03:26,960
seeing that. You know, what we're actually seeing across the country is that we actually have

33
0:03:26,960 --> 0:03:32,160
continued vaccine update. We're really seeing an exponential drop in cases. And one of the things

34
0:03:32,160 --> 0:03:36,560
that I've actually talked to people a lot about because people ask me, what did you think

35
0:03:36,560 --> 0:03:43,360
about when the CDC made that comment about people with full vaccination don't necessarily have to

36
0:03:43,360 --> 0:03:48,880
wear masks in a lot of situations. And it was interesting to watch because the number of people

37
0:03:48,880 --> 0:03:53,040
being vaccinated, the number of people scheduling to get vaccinated per day was actually declining.

38
0:03:53,680 --> 0:03:59,200
And if you actually look at that day, when Dr. Walensky came out with this announcement,

39
0:03:59,200 --> 0:04:04,640
there actually was an uptick in the number of people going to the vaccine websites to schedule.

40
0:04:04,640 --> 0:04:10,240
And then Anthony Fauci said, you know, sort of mused that boy, I wonder if this might actually

41
0:04:10,240 --> 0:04:16,080
be an incentive. And there was another uptick in people visiting. And then the president tweeted,

42
0:04:16,080 --> 0:04:21,120
and there was another uptick. So, you know, people like carrots, right, the chocolate-covered

43
0:04:21,120 --> 0:04:24,880
carrot, the hey, you know, I may not believe in those things, but if I get a shot in the arm,

44
0:04:24,880 --> 0:04:29,920
I'm allowed to take my mask off. All right, whatever. I'm, you know, I'm not that anti-getting

45
0:04:29,920 --> 0:04:36,320
vaccinated, right? So, what we're seeing, and I think to echo this is on the ground here,

46
0:04:36,320 --> 0:04:43,840
we are seeing a significant drop in the number of people testing positive. The other day, I think

47
0:04:43,840 --> 0:04:50,800
Monday, it was in the 300s in the entire state. I did get, you know, an admission this morning

48
0:04:50,800 --> 0:04:59,200
with a gentleman in his late 50s with the COVID. Unfortunately, there's a perception going with

49
0:04:59,200 --> 0:05:04,880
the pandemic is ending. And so, this gentleman was seen nine days ago. He's a gentleman in his

50
0:05:04,880 --> 0:05:11,120
late 50s. He has hypertension. And his doctor said, well, you got the COVID, but don't you worry

51
0:05:11,120 --> 0:05:16,800
because the COVID's going away. The COVID you have is mild. We're not really seeing hospitalizations

52
0:05:16,800 --> 0:05:22,960
or deaths anymore. And I want to point out, no, no, the COVID in him is the COVID in him.

53
0:05:22,960 --> 0:05:29,040
COVID has not evolved into a less virulent pathogen. This person was not offered monoclonal

54
0:05:29,040 --> 0:05:31,200
was really was offered nothing other than, you know,

55
0:05:32,080 --> 0:05:37,520
pilot offers fever. Now he's in the hospital. He's on steroids. He's on remdesivir. He's on

56
0:05:37,520 --> 0:05:43,280
blood thinners. He's on oxygen. So, yeah, though, just because it's getting better all over,

57
0:05:43,280 --> 0:05:48,720
that individual patient is still at risk of bad outcomes. And we're still seeing hundreds of people

58
0:05:48,720 --> 0:05:54,000
dying per day. So, as Rosie as we like to paint the picture, people are still dying every day.

59
0:05:54,000 --> 0:05:58,800
Hundreds of people are still dying here every day in the US. And around the world, the picture

60
0:05:58,800 --> 0:06:05,680
particularly in lots of areas Southeast Asia, South America, it's really not great. So,

61
0:06:05,680 --> 0:06:10,960
was he vaccinated? He was not. And I asked him that. And he rolled his eyes and said,

62
0:06:10,960 --> 0:06:18,640
and I'm regretting that decision. All right. Yeah, you know, if he could go back in time,

63
0:06:18,640 --> 0:06:23,120
I think he would have, you know, made a different decision. And that's what he told me.

64
0:06:23,120 --> 0:06:26,160
I did start off. I gave him a hard time, right? Because he's not vaccinating. I said,

65
0:06:26,160 --> 0:06:30,000
what are you doing? You know, it's like we're in bell bottoms. This is not what you're supposed

66
0:06:30,000 --> 0:06:35,920
to be doing these days showing up with COVID. And he's, I know. So, hopefully he's going to do well.

67
0:06:35,920 --> 0:06:41,120
Fingers crossed. We'll provide him with all the care we can. And hopefully then he will discuss

68
0:06:41,120 --> 0:06:46,400
to other members of his tribe the benefit of vaccine versus the five day hospital stay,

69
0:06:46,400 --> 0:06:52,400
hopefully five day hospital stay only. All right. Children and COVID, as I like to say,

70
0:06:52,400 --> 0:06:58,800
children are at low risk, but they're not at no risk. And CDC updated the camp guidance again

71
0:06:59,440 --> 0:07:07,360
May 28. So what, what is new? Well, far as masks staff and campers who are fully vaccinated do not

72
0:07:07,360 --> 0:07:15,040
need to wear masks at camp, except where they're required by local legislature. Although fully

73
0:07:15,040 --> 0:07:19,760
vaccinated people do not need to wear masks, camps can be supportive of staff or campers who choose

74
0:07:19,760 --> 0:07:26,400
to continue to wear a mask, right? I'm still that guy at the gym wearing a mask. So hopefully people

75
0:07:26,400 --> 0:07:32,240
continue to support that physical distancing. Again, they're doubling down on this saying,

76
0:07:32,240 --> 0:07:39,360
you know, people are fully vaccinated, except as indicated, physical distancing is not necessary

77
0:07:39,360 --> 0:07:45,200
for campers and staff who are fully vaccinated. Hand hygiene respiratory etiquette. Apparently,

78
0:07:45,200 --> 0:07:49,760
now Vincent, you no longer have to wash your hands or cover your cough now, just joking, looking

79
0:07:49,760 --> 0:07:57,440
there. You should continue. This is like COVID independent, but you should continue to have health

80
0:07:57,440 --> 0:08:02,160
promoting behaviors such as hand hygiene, respiratory etiquette. Remember, respiratory etiquette is

81
0:08:02,160 --> 0:08:09,120
not coughing into your hand and offering it to your neighbor for a firm hand embrace. They do

82
0:08:09,680 --> 0:08:14,400
weigh in a little bit on cleaning, improving ventilation, maintaining healthy facilities.

83
0:08:14,400 --> 0:08:19,760
You know, they still want you to continue cleaning, disinfecting, and you know, continue to hammer

84
0:08:19,760 --> 0:08:25,120
on ventilation recommendations. You know, and if it's a high touch surface, you know, keep

85
0:08:25,120 --> 0:08:30,240
cleaning. And I think that's good practice over time, but they do say improve, maintain,

86
0:08:30,240 --> 0:08:34,960
improve ventilation, open those windows, use the air filters, turn on the fans,

87
0:08:35,680 --> 0:08:40,640
all those things that we've learned can be of benefit. And they do actually weigh in on testing.

88
0:08:40,640 --> 0:08:47,280
So people who are fully vaccinated do not need to undergo routine COVID-19 screening testing.

89
0:08:48,080 --> 0:08:52,080
And then they go in just a little more. If a person's fully vaccinated, they're exposed,

90
0:08:52,080 --> 0:08:57,600
but they don't have symptoms, you do not need to keep testing them or quarantine or isolate them.

91
0:08:58,240 --> 0:09:02,640
If they get infected, however, so they start showing symptoms, then you go ahead and you test

92
0:09:02,640 --> 0:09:08,560
them because we do see breakthrough there. I'm wondering if Colombia is going to do away with

93
0:09:08,560 --> 0:09:14,720
the testing on that, you know, that see you open application pretty soon. So I'm waiting, but I'm

94
0:09:14,720 --> 0:09:21,440
really waiting to not wait online for the bathroom anymore, because we're only allowed one person at

95
0:09:21,440 --> 0:09:29,760
a time in the bathrooms. That can be a challenge for for well, well, welcome to what the other

96
0:09:29,760 --> 0:09:35,440
sex experience for many years, right? It's true. They always set up facilities. So that, yeah,

97
0:09:35,440 --> 0:09:40,560
okay, we still have distancing and masking requirements here as well. You know, you can't

98
0:09:40,560 --> 0:09:45,280
have more people in a lab that would not allow six feet of distance. You have to wear masks,

99
0:09:45,280 --> 0:09:51,920
et cetera. So yeah, did you upload your vaccine card? I did. Yeah, there's no a vaccine requirement

100
0:09:52,480 --> 0:09:59,520
at Columbia. That's right. Yeah, so testing never missed an opportunity to test, right? We still

101
0:09:59,520 --> 0:10:06,560
see there being an important role for this in certain context, right? So this is modifying a

102
0:10:06,560 --> 0:10:12,560
little. But what about serology testing? What about that other test? The FDA has actually

103
0:10:12,560 --> 0:10:18,720
recommended that we do not check serologies. And there's actually an FDA posting on this. I'm

104
0:10:18,720 --> 0:10:24,560
going to touch on this a few times because just by the way, physicians are not listening to that

105
0:10:24,560 --> 0:10:30,640
nor our patients. So we'll get into that issue in different contexts. But what about those rapid

106
0:10:30,640 --> 0:10:37,200
tests? You know, there's been this idea. And there was an event, I think in Washington that sort of,

107
0:10:37,200 --> 0:10:43,120
well, a couple of things in Washington that maybe gave rapid antigen testing a bad name or some loss

108
0:10:43,120 --> 0:10:50,000
of confidence. But there was an article same day, SARS-CoV-2 antigen test screening in an indoor

109
0:10:50,000 --> 0:10:55,680
mass gathering live music event, a randomized control trial. And this was this article is

110
0:10:55,680 --> 0:11:01,600
published in the Lancet Infectious Disease. And this was a randomized controlled open labeled trial.

111
0:11:02,160 --> 0:11:06,560
So people knew they're getting tested to assess the effectiveness of a comprehensive

112
0:11:06,560 --> 0:11:12,560
preventative intervention for a mass gathering indoor events is a live concert. So testing is

113
0:11:12,560 --> 0:11:18,640
part of this comprehensive program. And what they did is they did same day screening of attendees

114
0:11:18,640 --> 0:11:26,720
with an antigen based rapid test. They also face masks adequate air ventilation. And the whole goal

115
0:11:26,720 --> 0:11:31,280
of this, right, is a lot of a lot of these venues were shut down. And it was really asking the

116
0:11:31,280 --> 0:11:36,960
question, can we put together this program, which includes testing to allow these events to occur

117
0:11:36,960 --> 0:11:46,160
in an acceptably safe manner. So these were adults aged 18 to 59 with a negative result. So you were

118
0:11:46,160 --> 0:11:52,640
tested, you had a negative result. And this was a nasopharyngeal swab collected immediately. And

119
0:11:52,640 --> 0:11:57,760
then if you were, if you're positive, you got to go home. But if you're negative, then you were

120
0:11:57,760 --> 0:12:03,040
randomized either to attend the event, or I thought this was, or you get sent home, right? So they

121
0:12:03,040 --> 0:12:07,680
got to randomize you. So this way, you're actually going to be in that control group to know if

122
0:12:07,680 --> 0:12:13,840
whatever positivity is relative to this event or not. And then they actually also took these

123
0:12:13,840 --> 0:12:22,800
specimens. And they did RTPCR. They did cell culture on Vero E6 cells. And what did they do?

124
0:12:22,800 --> 0:12:30,080
They then eight days after the event, they collected another nasopharyngeal swab. They analyzed this

125
0:12:30,080 --> 0:12:37,360
by rapid antigen by RTPCR. And they did a transcription mediated amplification test of TMA. So that's

126
0:12:37,360 --> 0:12:43,600
that's a very sensitive PCR modality. And the primary outcome was the difference in the incidence

127
0:12:43,600 --> 0:12:50,400
of the RTPCR based confirmed infection at eight days between the control group and those people

128
0:12:50,400 --> 0:13:00,480
who were sent home. Well, so at baseline, let's say that we had 3% of people in the control group,

129
0:13:00,480 --> 0:13:05,200
the people who were sent home, and 3% of the people in the experimental group were positive.

130
0:13:05,200 --> 0:13:12,320
So there was no, no significant difference there. The RTPCR test was positive in one case in each

131
0:13:12,320 --> 0:13:18,560
group. And the cell viral culture was negative in all cases. And I just want to point out what

132
0:13:18,560 --> 0:13:26,400
I'm sort of pushing out here is that so even though you had a positive PCR test that you missed

133
0:13:26,400 --> 0:13:32,960
with that rapid antigen test, there was no viral culture growth. This was below, we think, a level

134
0:13:32,960 --> 0:13:40,640
of contagiousness. There was no, no contagiousness occurring at this concert. So eight days after the

135
0:13:40,640 --> 0:13:48,080
event, less than 1% of the individuals in the control arm had a positive antigen or PCR test.

136
0:13:49,200 --> 0:13:54,080
No one was found to be positive in the intervention group. So basically what they're sort of

137
0:13:54,080 --> 0:13:59,520
reinforcing here is that this is another way of approaching these large gatherings. And I think

138
0:13:59,520 --> 0:14:05,120
you couple this with a dropping incidence. And maybe this is why people are in certain ways saying

139
0:14:05,120 --> 0:14:10,560
we're getting to the end of the pandemic in certain situations. Active vaccination never

140
0:14:10,560 --> 0:14:16,480
miss an opportunity to vaccinate and vaccines are how this pandemic ends. Moderna has now

141
0:14:16,480 --> 0:14:23,520
officially applied for the EUA expansion down to age 12. That was on June 1st. So we are expecting

142
0:14:23,520 --> 0:14:30,000
an approval later this month. So that was announced by Moderna. That's going to help, right? And

143
0:14:30,000 --> 0:14:36,720
people sort of, do we need, yeah, we need as many cylinders firing as possible. Pfizer is out there,

144
0:14:36,720 --> 0:14:42,880
Pfizer, if anything, has a little more ease. You know, you can get it out there, can sit in a fridge

145
0:14:42,880 --> 0:14:47,120
for a month. If you work with other groups, you can somehow deal with the fact that instead of

146
0:14:47,120 --> 0:14:53,440
ordering 1,000, maybe only order about 600. But Moderna is a little more convenient to be completely

147
0:14:53,440 --> 0:14:58,320
honest. It's also a little less user issue. I just relate some issues that I've gotten calls about,

148
0:14:58,320 --> 0:15:04,000
which are frightening, you know, well-named, famous academic centers where they didn't realize

149
0:15:04,000 --> 0:15:08,960
that that normal saline needed to be added to the concentrated vaccine. And they were actually

150
0:15:08,960 --> 0:15:12,400
vaccinating people with normal saline all day and then wanted to know what they should do.

151
0:15:13,280 --> 0:15:19,360
The Moderna, it's pre-mixed. It's in the bottle. It's really, you know, I think very

152
0:15:19,360 --> 0:15:25,680
idiot-proof. Nothing's completely idiot-proof, but so okay. What about side effects and efficacy? So

153
0:15:25,680 --> 0:15:30,800
I'm going to talk a little case here about something that's been in the press a little bit and people

154
0:15:30,800 --> 0:15:39,040
have been asking about what about the issue of myocarditis after vaccination? So people may have

155
0:15:39,040 --> 0:15:46,480
heard that there was a concern raised initially with Pfizer. Was there an increased risk, increased

156
0:15:46,480 --> 0:15:52,320
incidence of myocarditis after Pfizer vaccination? Information out of Israel suggesting that maybe

157
0:15:52,320 --> 0:15:59,840
there was an increased incidence. Pfizer replying with, well, it's really not above background.

158
0:15:59,840 --> 0:16:05,040
But one of the interesting issues that we saw last year is we actually saw a decline

159
0:16:05,040 --> 0:16:11,600
in the amount of myocarditis that we were seeing. So we got called on a, you know, somewhat regular

160
0:16:11,600 --> 0:16:18,400
basis. A adolescent seems to be men more than women. So adolescent males, you know, late teens

161
0:16:18,400 --> 0:16:25,840
or early 20s. I guess you're not an adolescent, you're 20s, but young men who have a viral illness,

162
0:16:25,840 --> 0:16:30,240
and then afterwards they'll have a mild inflammation of the heart. So you'll be able to pick this up

163
0:16:30,240 --> 0:16:34,960
with some blood tests, troponins will rise a little bit. They'll have a discomfort in the left chest.

164
0:16:35,840 --> 0:16:41,520
We give them ibuprofen, a leave, things like that for a few days, gets better. They tend to do

165
0:16:41,520 --> 0:16:50,240
very well in general. So this was earlier this week, a gentleman, early 20s, who had gotten his

166
0:16:50,240 --> 0:16:57,440
J&J vaccine. I thought that was a little twist. Four days before, he had had COVID back in December.

167
0:16:58,000 --> 0:17:04,160
A lot of folks had COVID back in December. And then four days after the vaccine, he started to develop

168
0:17:04,160 --> 0:17:09,760
pain on the left side of his chest, rated up into the neck and down the arm. His troponins were

169
0:17:09,760 --> 0:17:17,840
elevated as were some other inflammatory markers. We treated him with a couple days of ibuprofen.

170
0:17:17,840 --> 0:17:23,920
The troponins trended down. He started to feel better, and now he's recovering. But it does

171
0:17:23,920 --> 0:17:29,840
look like there is some sort of connection here. It is a little bit above background.

172
0:17:29,840 --> 0:17:35,360
Interesting enough, it's not above the background of what we used to see when we had viruses circulating

173
0:17:35,360 --> 0:17:41,680
freely. And what I described is sort of a typical course. Even what I described is maybe a little

174
0:17:41,680 --> 0:17:49,200
more severe where he actually get the elevated enzymes. But short-lived, people take the ibuprofen,

175
0:17:49,200 --> 0:17:55,440
the leave, they have discomfort for a couple days, it resolves. So that is out there. The CDC

176
0:17:55,440 --> 0:18:01,600
has basically said this is low incidence. It's a low risk. And it's not really something that

177
0:18:01,600 --> 0:18:07,360
should impact your decisions regarding vaccination. But we'll hit on that a little bit later as well.

178
0:18:08,320 --> 0:18:15,040
Now, what about efficacy? So on one hand, we're being told not to check serology tests. But then

179
0:18:15,040 --> 0:18:20,000
we keep seeing articles talking about serology tests. And then we bemoan the fact that certain

180
0:18:20,000 --> 0:18:26,640
populations seem not to be responding. So this is a publication that came out looking at patients

181
0:18:26,640 --> 0:18:32,720
with rheumatoid arthritis who are taking a medication called methotrexate, which interferes

182
0:18:32,720 --> 0:18:42,480
with the immune system. The article was methotrexate, hamper's immunogenicity to BNT162B2 mRNA COVID-19

183
0:18:42,480 --> 0:18:49,680
vaccine, an immune mediated inflammatory disease. Actually, it was earlier on a call with Shane

184
0:18:49,680 --> 0:18:53,520
Crotty. So I brought this up and we talked about this a little. So a shout out to Shane Crotty,

185
0:18:53,520 --> 0:18:59,520
who's hopefully helping us understand some of the immunology in this realm. But this was a paper

186
0:19:00,880 --> 0:19:07,200
that if you really look at it closely, it tells a slightly different story from the title. So

187
0:19:08,160 --> 0:19:16,240
they looked at the spike specific SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers from people with immune-mediated

188
0:19:16,240 --> 0:19:22,240
inflammatory disease. And they found that those were in a range of, people have to write these down,

189
0:19:22,240 --> 0:19:35,120
but 25 to 737,310. Those on methotrexate, 25 to 694,528. I wasn't impressed by that difference.

190
0:19:35,120 --> 0:19:39,680
The median was actually lower. So the median, the middle number where people were clustering,

191
0:19:39,680 --> 0:19:46,160
was a little bit lower for those on methotrexate. But then we get back to the question of what really

192
0:19:46,160 --> 0:19:52,560
is the cutoff for protection? So was this median difference actually above or below? Is it a question

193
0:19:52,560 --> 0:19:59,840
of more protection? I was used, Eloise, an example. Was this a 95 versus a 99? Once we're in the 90s,

194
0:19:59,840 --> 0:20:04,480
I feel like we're pretty good. So the other thing that I thought was really interesting,

195
0:20:04,480 --> 0:20:10,320
if you look at the data, you can see that twice as many people. So 19% of the people,

196
0:20:10,320 --> 0:20:16,480
not a methotrexate, had prior infection and then got vaccinated. And we know that skews the data,

197
0:20:16,480 --> 0:20:19,520
right? We know that people that have prior infection who get vaccinated are going to have

198
0:20:19,520 --> 0:20:26,720
higher numbers. That was 19.2% versus 8%. So are we sort of getting a skew here? Are we studying

199
0:20:27,600 --> 0:20:33,120
people who are previously infected and vaccinated versus people uninfected and then vaccinated? So

200
0:20:33,120 --> 0:20:39,200
I would have much preferred a study on methotrexate or not in people without prior infection.

201
0:20:39,200 --> 0:20:45,040
Maybe methotrexate or not in people with prior infection versus sort of sticking all those together.

202
0:20:45,840 --> 0:20:50,480
And then they also looked at T cells as well, again, with the same caveats, but suggesting a

203
0:20:50,480 --> 0:20:57,760
lower T cell response in individuals on methotrexate. So this is clearly a hot topic right now,

204
0:20:58,480 --> 0:21:02,480
because there's really people would like to know, particularly, we'll say the

205
0:21:02,480 --> 0:21:06,160
higher risk populations, people with impaired immune system,

206
0:21:06,160 --> 0:21:12,000
are transplant patients, are patients with autoimmune diseases, hematological. So those are the blood

207
0:21:12,000 --> 0:21:18,800
cancers, lymphomas, leukemia, things like that. They would want to know if they got their vaccine,

208
0:21:18,800 --> 0:21:24,160
if they actually have protection or not. What is happening right now is that a lot of their

209
0:21:24,160 --> 0:21:28,640
physicians are checking anybody levels. And if those anybody levels do not come back above a

210
0:21:28,640 --> 0:21:32,560
certain level, they're being told by the physician to act as if they're not vaccinated.

211
0:21:32,560 --> 0:21:37,840
I don't know if that's true or not. We don't know if that's true or not. As I mentioned,

212
0:21:37,840 --> 0:21:42,240
we've had studies where you vaccinate transplant patients and then check what percent have

213
0:21:42,240 --> 0:21:46,560
antibody levels. The one we discussed was about 15 percent after the first, a little less than

214
0:21:46,560 --> 0:21:51,280
50 percent after the second. People are going and giving these individuals a third shot.

215
0:21:52,000 --> 0:21:57,440
We do not know if that's required. We do not know what correlates of immunity here. So

216
0:21:57,440 --> 0:22:04,400
I think we need to know because if we don't know, people are going to continue to do these things

217
0:22:04,400 --> 0:22:08,080
to sort of try to get out in front of the science to try to help these patients.

218
0:22:08,720 --> 0:22:12,720
And it is really tough because there's also an equity issue here, right? We're talking about

219
0:22:12,720 --> 0:22:18,720
people getting thirds when some people in the world haven't even had firsts. So this is a tough

220
0:22:18,720 --> 0:22:25,040
issue. But the reality here in the US is we now have more vaccines than demand. So some of those

221
0:22:25,040 --> 0:22:32,320
vaccines each day are going to waste. So do we do we say you guys sign up and instead of it going

222
0:22:32,320 --> 0:22:37,520
into the trash, it hard-fosme, it goes into one of these individual's arms. Does that make a difference?

223
0:22:37,520 --> 0:22:41,760
Again, something we really need to study so we know what to do for these individuals.

224
0:22:41,760 --> 0:22:46,320
The period of detectable viral replication. So I like to say the time for monitoring

225
0:22:46,320 --> 0:22:51,440
or monoclonals. And then I also want to add where you get your test is where you should get

226
0:22:51,440 --> 0:22:59,760
your monoclonals. So we're seeing some changes in which monoclonals are recommended in certain

227
0:22:59,760 --> 0:23:07,600
areas. So the increasing rate of the variants. I'm going to use the old terminology here. P1

228
0:23:07,600 --> 0:23:18,000
and B351. Should I translate those into our Roman numerals? So that would be the P1 or the gamma

229
0:23:18,000 --> 0:23:26,240
variant of concern. That would be the 1351. That's the beta. So basically what they're saying is these

230
0:23:26,240 --> 0:23:32,960
clinically relevant important changes are suggesting that we should be switching over to

231
0:23:32,960 --> 0:23:41,840
Regeneron instead of the Eli Lilly monoclonal antibody in eight states. And really, there's

232
0:23:41,840 --> 0:23:47,520
an anticipation that as we see more of these variants, this is why I care about the variants

233
0:23:47,520 --> 0:23:51,840
to be honest. It impacts therapy. And David Ho a long time ago just said, Dan, just start using

234
0:23:51,840 --> 0:23:56,320
Regeneron. You don't have to worry about this. And now we have more products on the horizon,

235
0:23:56,320 --> 0:24:04,720
right? We've got the GSK, which basically now in the in the EUA fact sheet, they actually have

236
0:24:04,720 --> 0:24:11,360
data on the ability of the different monoclonals to have efficacy with different variants out there.

237
0:24:11,360 --> 0:24:18,160
So yeah, so this is usually not being made at the bedside. We were talking earlier today with

238
0:24:18,160 --> 0:24:24,240
a number of physicians. This is being made usually by the pharmacists at some of the infusion centers,

239
0:24:24,240 --> 0:24:28,800
at some of the hospitals, at some of the regional distribution, basically which monoclonal that

240
0:24:28,800 --> 0:24:33,360
happens to be on us to make sure that when you send your patient from monoclonals,

241
0:24:33,360 --> 0:24:37,360
that they're being treated with a monoclonal, which is appropriate for what's going on in

242
0:24:37,360 --> 0:24:45,360
your regional area. All right, the early inflammatory phase, the the Cole Corona article finally came

243
0:24:45,360 --> 0:24:52,000
out as a peer reviewed article. So Colchicine for community treated patients with COVID-19

244
0:24:52,000 --> 0:24:58,720
Cole Corona, a phase three randomized double-blinded adaptive placebo controlled multi-center trial.

245
0:24:59,360 --> 0:25:04,800
And this was published in the Lancet Respiratory Medicine. And we did cover this before in its

246
0:25:04,800 --> 0:25:10,400
preprint state. But here it is. This is a phase three randomized double-blind adaptive placebo

247
0:25:10,400 --> 0:25:16,800
controlled multi-center trial done in Brazil, Canada, Greece, South Africa, Spain, and the USA

248
0:25:16,800 --> 0:25:22,800
by the Montreal Heart Institute. And the primary efficacy endpoint was the composite of death

249
0:25:22,800 --> 0:25:28,800
or hospital admission for COVID-19. And cut to the chase, they failed to show any statistically

250
0:25:28,800 --> 0:25:34,640
significant benefit for Colchicine in the treatment of COVID-19. But there was a significant

251
0:25:34,640 --> 0:25:41,760
increase in diarrhea. But now the plot does perhaps thicken. If you really start reading

252
0:25:41,760 --> 0:25:49,040
through the discussion here, they report that due to a lack of reagents, a lot of these cases,

253
0:25:49,040 --> 0:25:54,400
they were never able to actually test and confirm that it was COVID. So a lot of the cases included

254
0:25:54,400 --> 0:26:02,800
in the analysis, never got a PCR test was a clinical diagnosis. So the the authors then,

255
0:26:02,800 --> 0:26:05,920
I'm going to say data mind, right? You're not really supposed to do this. They went through

256
0:26:05,920 --> 0:26:11,680
in data mind and suggested that if you then only look at people with PCR positivity cases,

257
0:26:11,680 --> 0:26:19,200
then you could show a benefit to Colchicine. So this, this story may continue. Now I'm going to,

258
0:26:19,200 --> 0:26:24,000
I've noticed that we've been getting a little bit too long, I'm going to say. So I'm going to go

259
0:26:24,000 --> 0:26:30,640
right to the tail phase here. So we still have a very limited understanding of mechanisms behind

260
0:26:30,640 --> 0:26:37,040
much of what we are seeing in this population. And so with the pulmonary issues and neurological

261
0:26:37,040 --> 0:26:42,880
issues being very common, we did see what I hope is the first in a line of articles giving us a

262
0:26:42,880 --> 0:26:47,760
little better understanding of what's going on with long COVID. And this was the article

263
0:26:47,760 --> 0:26:54,800
Small Airways Disease is a post acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This was posted as

264
0:26:54,800 --> 0:27:02,240
preprint. The authors looked at adults with confirmed COVID-19 who had remained symptomatic

265
0:27:02,240 --> 0:27:09,120
more than 30 days following the acute onset of symptoms. So symptoms, pulmonary function tests,

266
0:27:10,320 --> 0:27:16,240
chest computed tomography. So chest CT findings were compared across different severity groups

267
0:27:16,240 --> 0:27:24,560
to healthy controls. CT images were analyzed measuring regional ground glass opacities.

268
0:27:25,200 --> 0:27:30,400
And they actually measured regional air trapping. They had a special algorithm for this. They looked

269
0:27:30,400 --> 0:27:38,160
at 100 patients, 67 of them were ambulatory, had never been hospitalized. And they report

270
0:27:38,160 --> 0:27:42,720
that the pulmonary function testing revealed restrictive physiology rights, as long as we're

271
0:27:42,720 --> 0:27:50,240
not expanding, as much as it was restriction there. In the hospitalized at the ICU groups,

272
0:27:50,880 --> 0:27:56,080
but normal in the ambulatory group. Among the hospitalized and ICU patients,

273
0:27:56,880 --> 0:28:03,760
the mean percent of the total unclassified as that ground glass opacification was 13.2

274
0:28:04,320 --> 0:28:12,640
and 28.7%. So 13.2 and hospitalized, 28.7 in the prior ICU patients, respectively.

275
0:28:12,640 --> 0:28:17,920
And was higher than in the ambulatory ambulatory patients, you're only seeing about 3.7%.

276
0:28:18,880 --> 0:28:28,480
So they were suggesting here that air trapping, this small airway disease was a significant issue

277
0:28:28,480 --> 0:28:34,960
in a lot of these individuals. It could be quantified by CT, and it did actually correspond

278
0:28:34,960 --> 0:28:40,720
to initial severity. So I think that's helpful, right? Because we're starting to try to understand

279
0:28:40,720 --> 0:28:48,560
what is going on. This is definitely a mixed group of patients here. So what I want to say, too,

280
0:28:48,560 --> 0:28:55,520
is long COVID has become a major issue for society and actually for employers. So I've been in a

281
0:28:55,520 --> 0:29:00,640
number of calls in the last couple of weeks here, where a lot of our large employers have realized

282
0:29:00,640 --> 0:29:06,400
that a chunk consistent with the literature, 10% or more of their individuals who had COVID

283
0:29:06,400 --> 0:29:12,960
are now having difficulties returning to the workplace in full capacity. And I've been asked

284
0:29:12,960 --> 0:29:20,720
to help with identifying these past post-acute squalive COVID centers of excellence. This is

285
0:29:20,720 --> 0:29:24,960
really a challenge, right? We've all heard of centers of excellence. And that is not, that

286
0:29:24,960 --> 0:29:29,680
should not just be a marketing term. This needs to be a center that can demonstrate

287
0:29:29,680 --> 0:29:36,560
some sort of excellence, some outcomes that are excellent compared to the other options

288
0:29:36,560 --> 0:29:41,120
that a patient might have. So we've talked a little bit about what criteria there should be

289
0:29:41,120 --> 0:29:45,440
here, and I'd love to hear some impact from people here. Because this is, I feel like we're in the

290
0:29:45,440 --> 0:29:50,640
early days of long COVID, much the way we were in the early days of COVID about a year ago.

291
0:29:51,200 --> 0:29:55,920
But what works, what benefits people? And we're getting a lot of input from patients on this.

292
0:29:55,920 --> 0:30:00,400
The CDC is hopefully going to come out with our guidance soon, which we'll discuss. But one of

293
0:30:00,400 --> 0:30:07,760
the things that seems key is that a multi-disciplinary team is in place. So this gives a patient access

294
0:30:07,760 --> 0:30:16,880
to pulmonary neurology, psychiatric infectious disease, and other specialists with experience

295
0:30:16,880 --> 0:30:23,840
treating acute as well as long COVID patients. I sort of shy away here from narrow focused

296
0:30:23,840 --> 0:30:30,480
programs, which just look at post-ICU, just post-hospital, or just really roll these people into a

297
0:30:30,480 --> 0:30:37,840
pre-existing or expanded rehabilitation program. It is much more than just post-ICU rehab. We're

298
0:30:37,840 --> 0:30:44,960
also looking at this. I think it's important that we truly have centers. So you need a critical number

299
0:30:44,960 --> 0:30:49,840
of patients because we are still as clinicians learning from the patients. This is a dialogue.

300
0:30:49,840 --> 0:30:54,800
We don't know the answers yet. And so as you interact with a larger volume of patients,

301
0:30:55,520 --> 0:31:00,560
you can learn quite a bit more. We also want, and this ties directly in,

302
0:31:00,560 --> 0:31:06,480
centers that can connect patients to clinical trials. We are still learning. And what is the

303
0:31:06,480 --> 0:31:12,160
plural of anecdote? It is not data. So not only do we feel like we're learning as we treat these

304
0:31:12,160 --> 0:31:16,560
patients, but we want to get these patients connected in clinical trials. So we can really

305
0:31:16,560 --> 0:31:23,440
formalize that into real science, real data, so we know how to help these folks. Telemedicine

306
0:31:24,640 --> 0:31:31,360
capability is really of great benefit for these patients. So we think of that as probably essential

307
0:31:31,360 --> 0:31:37,440
for some of these centers. And what are those measures of excellence? What are we hoping to

308
0:31:38,080 --> 0:31:42,960
provide for these patients? One, which is huge for a lot of our patients, they want to be back

309
0:31:42,960 --> 0:31:47,280
to the ability to perform those things they did before. They want to get back to work. They want

310
0:31:47,280 --> 0:31:52,880
to get back to that prior function. They want improvement in symptoms. If it's trouble breathing,

311
0:31:52,880 --> 0:31:57,760
if it's brain fog, if it's headaches, if it's fatigue, they want improvement in symptoms.

312
0:31:58,400 --> 0:32:03,120
And these centers should actually be providing good patient satisfaction. We want

313
0:32:03,760 --> 0:32:07,280
centers where this experience is positive because boy, these patients have been through an

314
0:32:07,280 --> 0:32:13,760
incredibly difficult time with a lot of dismissiveness. All right, well, let me close there before we

315
0:32:13,760 --> 0:32:18,880
go to emails and thank everyone for continuing to go to parasites without borders.com and please

316
0:32:18,880 --> 0:32:23,520
do that. Drop whatever you're doing. If you're driving to the side of the road on your smartphone,

317
0:32:23,520 --> 0:32:28,800
go to parasites without borders and click donate and help us do the work we're doing,

318
0:32:28,800 --> 0:32:34,320
but also help us continue to support FIMRC Foundation International Medical Relief of Children.

319
0:32:34,320 --> 0:32:40,560
This is a fantastic group and I will throw in. I know there's been a lot of discussion of cattle

320
0:32:40,560 --> 0:32:46,320
on the other twibs. I may be one of the only Twib hosts who actually owns cattle. Does anyone

321
0:32:46,320 --> 0:32:59,520
else own cattle? I have a milk cow and Brian and I also have a heifer, Mary, in Uganda. So I am

322
0:32:59,520 --> 0:33:05,040
hoping that we can get this pandemic going in the right direction so I can get back there to Uganda

323
0:33:05,040 --> 0:33:10,160
to the FIMRC clinic there. See my cows, see my friends. So help us with your support.

324
0:33:10,160 --> 0:33:13,840
Yeah, you have mentioned that a few times. Your cows and Uganda. It's very cool.

325
0:33:13,840 --> 0:33:18,720
Not cows. They're both cows, right? One's a heifer and one's a cow. Well, one is a cow, right? So

326
0:33:18,720 --> 0:33:24,240
you got to be what? Over the age of three, you got to have had a baby, you got to be so she's a milk

327
0:33:24,240 --> 0:33:31,520
cow. That's the mom. And Mary is just a heifer. She's a little over a year old.

328
0:33:32,560 --> 0:33:37,360
Never had a baby, right? Never had a baby yet. Give her a couple of years, Vincent.

329
0:33:38,400 --> 0:33:44,880
You bet. Time for some questions. If you'd like to send one in to Daniel, it's Daniel at

330
0:33:44,880 --> 0:33:51,520
microb.tv. First is from Kevin. My son is 12. We got his first dose the weekend. It was available.

331
0:33:51,520 --> 0:33:56,560
He's due for the next dose, June 5th. I'm reading in some places that perhaps delaying the second

332
0:33:56,560 --> 0:34:01,440
dose a few weeks months might lower the myocarditis risk that some kids are experiencing. I assume

333
0:34:01,440 --> 0:34:06,400
this would violate the never miss a chance to vaccinate credo, but wanted a direct answer from

334
0:34:06,400 --> 0:34:11,360
someone I have grown to trust on this issue. I'm not considering permanently postponing.

335
0:34:11,360 --> 0:34:17,600
I just wanted your opinion. Please treat this as you are in my shoes as his father.

336
0:34:17,600 --> 0:34:24,560
All right, Kevin. So I'm actually pretty much in your shoes. I have a 15 year old son Barnaby.

337
0:34:25,360 --> 0:34:33,040
He is scheduled for his second dose tomorrow afternoon. And as I mentioned with the myocardis,

338
0:34:33,040 --> 0:34:39,280
it's incredibly rare. The cases are mild. It's something that we can manage with just a couple

339
0:34:39,280 --> 0:34:45,760
days of really over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medicine. The risk of continuing to have your

340
0:34:45,760 --> 0:34:53,280
son my son unvaccinated is significant compared to this risk. So don't go ahead. Don't miss your

341
0:34:53,280 --> 0:34:59,200
opportunity. Don't delay. You know, once this is in, we've seen data saying that boy, these

342
0:34:59,200 --> 0:35:05,120
adolescents have really robust protection over time. So hopefully for them, this may be the last

343
0:35:05,120 --> 0:35:11,680
time this may be years and years of protection. Josh in Toronto writes, our 75 year old mother

344
0:35:11,680 --> 0:35:16,560
has been diagnosed with plasma cell leukemia, has been hospitalized for observation, started on

345
0:35:16,560 --> 0:35:24,080
dexamethasone about to begin bortezomib and lenaldomide. She has received one dose of Pfizer in March.

346
0:35:24,080 --> 0:35:29,120
Second dose has been delayed in Canada till July. Has been offered a second dose now. Is this

347
0:35:29,120 --> 0:35:34,880
recommended as her immune system is very taxed at present? And will her shot be compromised

348
0:35:34,880 --> 0:35:40,720
by chemo treatments? Curious about your approach in this scenario? Yeah, so she's on a number of

349
0:35:40,720 --> 0:35:47,520
medicines, right? So she has what I talked about the blood cancer, a plasma cell leukemia, right?

350
0:35:47,520 --> 0:35:52,080
I think I threw lymphoma in there, but really your leukemia is your classic blood cancers.

351
0:35:52,880 --> 0:35:57,840
She started here dexamethasone, the steroids, which we think also interferes with B cell function.

352
0:35:58,880 --> 0:36:05,360
She's on bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor. So that's also going to affect our immune cells.

353
0:36:05,360 --> 0:36:13,280
And she's on lenaldomide. And so yeah, this is basically a whole concoction designed to mess with

354
0:36:13,280 --> 0:36:19,360
B cells, plasma cells, plasma cells are really differentiated B cells. So when she gets vaccinated

355
0:36:19,360 --> 0:36:23,120
and you go and you know, like we're not supposed to and check her anybody levels three or four

356
0:36:23,120 --> 0:36:29,120
weeks later, they may be low. They may still be low right now. We still encourage people to get

357
0:36:29,120 --> 0:36:34,800
vaccinated. It may be that at some point in the future, as I discussed, this might be a population

358
0:36:34,800 --> 0:36:39,920
that is eligible either for a third dose, or maybe it's a population that is eligible for

359
0:36:39,920 --> 0:36:46,160
prophylactic antibodies. The vaccine that she gets, it's not going to be harmful.

360
0:36:46,160 --> 0:36:51,040
It may be beneficial. We just don't know how beneficial it is. So this would be a context

361
0:36:51,040 --> 0:36:55,280
where we would say definitely this is a high risk person. I would encourage the vaccination

362
0:36:55,280 --> 0:37:00,720
benefits would far outweigh the risks. Lee writes, I feel a complication with a prior disease I had

363
0:37:00,720 --> 0:37:06,000
when I was a child. Mononucleosis Epstein Barr has something to do with why the vaccine made me ill

364
0:37:06,000 --> 0:37:10,560
for six weeks. Is there any information on this? Anyone I could talk to the vaccine is so new,

365
0:37:10,560 --> 0:37:15,520
none of the doctors have talked to locally have any idea. The only suggested that the vaccine

366
0:37:15,520 --> 0:37:19,920
triggered something that was dormant to become active again. It had all the symptoms of mono

367
0:37:19,920 --> 0:37:27,120
again, plus some other neurological symptoms. Yeah, so I'm happy to I'm happy to help and I'll

368
0:37:27,120 --> 0:37:33,440
just actually offer, you know, so we have our post COVID care center where we actually have also

369
0:37:34,080 --> 0:37:38,400
sort of opened up and said, we're willing to talk to people and help people who have vaccine

370
0:37:38,400 --> 0:37:44,800
reactions. And often I'll jump in and help on issues like this. And again, we don't have great

371
0:37:44,800 --> 0:37:49,280
science here, but we are starting to get enough experience that hopefully we can offer some help.

372
0:37:49,280 --> 0:37:56,160
So people could just go ahead and they can call 151642 COVID. And also I do telemedicine

373
0:37:56,160 --> 0:38:04,560
consults across the country. So they can call 516-656-6500. My staff is killing me because

374
0:38:04,560 --> 0:38:09,680
I am working very late doing all these telemedicine, but I'm happy to help. This is a tough time.

375
0:38:10,480 --> 0:38:16,800
And if I can help you navigate post vaccination issues, I'm happy to step in and do that.

376
0:38:18,160 --> 0:38:22,320
And Jennifer writes, my mother went through breast cancer treatment has been in remission

377
0:38:22,320 --> 0:38:27,280
five years. However, she was left with peripheral neuropathy affecting her legs. Additionally,

378
0:38:27,280 --> 0:38:32,720
she had COVID in February. She asked her primary care MD if she should get the COVID vaccine and

379
0:38:32,720 --> 0:38:37,680
the doctor's answer was, well, I had to get it. So it's up to you. I'm not sure that was the

380
0:38:37,680 --> 0:38:42,320
most effective response. So my mother looked online for information. Of course, she found lots of

381
0:38:42,320 --> 0:38:47,600
disinformation. She's hesitant to get the vaccine. She's concerned it will worsen the neuropathy.

382
0:38:47,600 --> 0:38:51,760
Can you please provide guidance that will enable her to make a proper decision?

383
0:38:53,040 --> 0:38:58,720
This is one of those situations, and hopefully the physicians are listening, that if you leave

384
0:38:58,720 --> 0:39:02,880
a vacuum, someone else will fill it, and it won't really be the person you want to fill it.

385
0:39:03,680 --> 0:39:08,880
And I think that's what we're seeing here. So not really a great answer, doctor.

386
0:39:11,200 --> 0:39:16,240
This is a priority. I really think, and you look at this individual with this story,

387
0:39:16,240 --> 0:39:21,280
this is a person, if you get them vaccinated, you may be saving their lives. So you want

388
0:39:21,280 --> 0:39:26,560
to have this discussion. So here's what I'm going to say. So breast cancer treatment,

389
0:39:26,560 --> 0:39:31,040
remission for five years, that's that when we say, okay, that's behind us.

390
0:39:31,760 --> 0:39:37,840
Peripheral neuropathy. We are not seeing any issues here in the story that makes me suggest

391
0:39:37,840 --> 0:39:43,120
there's any reason to delay. This is an individual where I'm going to say I encourage you to get

392
0:39:43,120 --> 0:39:51,280
vaccinated. That's COVID-19 clinical update number 65 with Dr. Daniel Griffin. Thank you, Daniel.

393
0:39:51,280 --> 0:40:21,120
All right, thank you, and everyone be safe.
