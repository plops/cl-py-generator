This week in virology, the podcast about viruses, the kind that make you sick.

2
0:00:10,480 --> 0:00:21,440
From MicroTV, this is Twiv, this week in virology. Episode 761 recorded on May 27, 2021.

3
0:00:21,440 --> 0:00:26,160
I'm Vincent Rack and Yellow, and you're listening to the podcast all about viruses.

4
0:00:26,160 --> 0:00:32,000
Joining me today from New York, Daniel Griffin. Hello, everyone.

5
0:00:33,280 --> 0:00:39,200
Here we are, Daniel, in the midst of a pandemic, and people are arguing about whether the virus

6
0:00:39,200 --> 0:00:45,440
came from a lab or not. Is this crazy? Well, you know what? You got it, like you got to watch

7
0:00:45,440 --> 0:00:52,000
the subtleties, Vincent. You know, initially it was whether or not this was created in a lab.

8
0:00:52,000 --> 0:00:52,480
That's right.

9
0:00:52,480 --> 0:00:55,760
Now they're like, well, if it just had anything at all to do with the lab, we're going to take

10
0:00:55,760 --> 0:00:59,120
that as a win. I don't get it. I really don't get it.

11
0:00:59,120 --> 0:01:05,360
Yeah, well, yeah, I do, right. And I think, you know, everyone should listen to the most recent

12
0:01:05,360 --> 0:01:11,840
Twiv, which I truly enjoyed, where Peter Dashnek and crew, you know, basically the actual

13
0:01:11,840 --> 0:01:17,680
investigators who went there spoke for over an hour. And real, I thought that was a great

14
0:01:17,680 --> 0:01:23,920
episode, because right, so many of these headlines are out there, and you find those secret stuff

15
0:01:23,920 --> 0:01:28,320
we can't share with you. And then you find out the secret stuff is what we found out that during

16
0:01:28,320 --> 0:01:32,400
the cold and flu season, there were a few people at a large institute that had respiratory symptoms.

17
0:01:34,640 --> 0:01:41,200
Oh, my Lord, that confirms it. And by the way, you know, as Peter said, would you tell us who they

18
0:01:41,200 --> 0:01:44,720
are? We could go see if that was due to COVID. We can't tell you who those three people were.

19
0:01:44,720 --> 0:01:49,120
I mean, come on, it's, yeah, when you mix science and politics, what do you get Vincent?

20
0:01:49,760 --> 0:01:54,480
Politics, I love that. I thought that was great. Yeah, that was a great line.

21
0:01:55,520 --> 0:01:59,680
But of course, clinical, clinical medicine is immune from politics, right, Daniel?

22
0:02:00,400 --> 0:02:07,040
Oh, you know, you know, the really tough thing is nothing is immune from politics. And it's,

23
0:02:07,040 --> 0:02:11,520
it's all intermeshed. So sometimes it's really interesting when people say, oh, stay away from

24
0:02:11,520 --> 0:02:17,920
politics. It's, it's hard in medicine, right? Because public health is always directly tied

25
0:02:17,920 --> 0:02:24,400
in with politics. So, but all right, let's, let's try to avoid politics as much as we can. Okay.

26
0:02:25,920 --> 0:02:32,240
So, actually, boy, and then of course, here's my quotation, never, ever depend on governments

27
0:02:32,240 --> 0:02:37,040
or institutions to solve any major problems. All social change comes from the passion of

28
0:02:37,040 --> 0:02:43,680
individuals. And that was Margaret Mead, her usual apolitical self. And I think she's actually

29
0:02:43,680 --> 0:02:47,920
another one of those really tremendous individuals that my dad had the opportunity to get a chance

30
0:02:47,920 --> 0:02:53,920
to meet and talk with. So, very jealous that he's, he had this opportunity. But all right,

31
0:02:53,920 --> 0:02:58,000
let me let me give you a little bit of an update on what's going on here in New York. And what

32
0:02:58,000 --> 0:03:03,920
I'm going to try to do is I'm going to intersperse some of the stories because I am still admitting

33
0:03:03,920 --> 0:03:12,800
patients with COVID to the hospitals. But clearly, the numbers are lower. These individuals are,

34
0:03:12,800 --> 0:03:18,080
as we're seeing across the country, they're the unvaccinated. That's who gets sick with COVID.

35
0:03:18,080 --> 0:03:22,160
I mean, the vaccinations are incredibly powerful, right? We've quoted numbers,

36
0:03:23,120 --> 0:03:30,640
Rich was trying to do the math. Your chance of dying of COVID after a vaccine is one in 500,000.

37
0:03:30,640 --> 0:03:36,320
So, pretty, pretty tremendous. So, I will sort of say things are going in the right direction

38
0:03:36,320 --> 0:03:42,080
here in New York in so many ways. But I'm going to throw little clinical vignettes, little stories,

39
0:03:42,080 --> 0:03:47,280
little experiences that I'm having here that I think put this into context. So, I will start

40
0:03:47,280 --> 0:03:54,720
off with children and COVID. And by the time this dropped, I'll have been on the air Friday morning,

41
0:03:54,720 --> 0:04:00,960
channel 12, again, talking about a lot of the issues that have come up, a lot of the science,

42
0:04:00,960 --> 0:04:06,560
and a lot of how this is being translated. So, this is kind of quickly changing. So,

43
0:04:07,120 --> 0:04:14,160
May 19th, we had updated guidance here in New York State. And we had the executive order,

44
0:04:14,160 --> 0:04:19,600
right? These are executive orders, which are law, new guidance for health and safety measures at

45
0:04:19,600 --> 0:04:25,440
childcare, day camp, and overnight camp programs as New York proceeds with strategic reopening.

46
0:04:26,080 --> 0:04:30,960
So, I want to put this into context, as I have done before, some sort of repeating here,

47
0:04:30,960 --> 0:04:38,480
is the CDC gives us the science-based guidance. They try to interpret the science and translate

48
0:04:38,480 --> 0:04:43,680
that into what might affect how we comport ourselves. But ultimately, at the state level,

49
0:04:43,680 --> 0:04:49,360
our governors give us the rules that we have to live by. And I applaud all the clinicians

50
0:04:49,360 --> 0:04:53,760
and other health care professionals that I know are donating their time to help guide everyone

51
0:04:53,760 --> 0:04:59,440
through this. And fortunately, I'm finding as someone that gives advice to a lot of these places,

52
0:05:00,400 --> 0:05:05,440
that the staff is getting really savvy. They're really starting to get the science. I mean,

53
0:05:05,440 --> 0:05:10,480
they've been educated up, which is fantastic. There's also a lot of different associations that

54
0:05:11,440 --> 0:05:16,640
camps and restaurants and all these childcare facilities rely on. And those associations

55
0:05:16,640 --> 0:05:20,240
really have tremendous people that are taking the time and getting up on the science. So,

56
0:05:20,960 --> 0:05:25,120
with that said, what was that guidance? I'm going to tell you ahead of time,

57
0:05:25,120 --> 0:05:28,640
we got more guidance on the 24th, so that's going to get layered onto this. So,

58
0:05:28,640 --> 0:05:36,560
what was the initial guidance on the 19th? Facilities and programs must collect COVID-19

59
0:05:36,560 --> 0:05:43,120
vaccination status and documentation for all staff and children. So, that's actually kind of

60
0:05:43,120 --> 0:05:49,040
heavy, right? That's a little bit of a thing. We've talked about, you know, HIPAA's coming up

61
0:05:49,040 --> 0:05:54,800
periodically. But what is really the issue here? An employer, a person running with these programs

62
0:05:54,800 --> 0:06:00,000
can ask, you know, the HIPAA thing would be a person may say I'd rather not answer that question,

63
0:06:00,000 --> 0:06:04,400
but this is an interesting challenge. They're actually saying you must collect the vaccination

64
0:06:04,400 --> 0:06:11,120
status. So, that's going to be an interesting challenge into this summer. The next mandatory

65
0:06:11,120 --> 0:06:17,440
daily health screening practices of staff and visitors, including daily temperature checks.

66
0:06:18,320 --> 0:06:21,920
And that is a little bit of an issue. And we've discussed this at sort of a national level,

67
0:06:21,920 --> 0:06:27,840
is how much do those actually help? And then particularly those daily temperature checks,

68
0:06:27,840 --> 0:06:34,560
because we've got to start thinking of COVID as the flu. A lot of individuals, particularly during

69
0:06:34,560 --> 0:06:38,560
those first few days when they're shedding a lot, they do not have fevers, right? So,

70
0:06:38,560 --> 0:06:43,600
there's a little bit of an issue here, but that's your state, right? This will be different

71
0:06:43,600 --> 0:06:49,200
everyone else's state and country. Facility and programs need to notify the state and local

72
0:06:49,200 --> 0:06:56,320
health department immediately upon being informed of any positive COVID-19 test by a staff member

73
0:06:56,320 --> 0:07:03,760
or child at their site. Each site must implement a property specific capacity limitation

74
0:07:03,760 --> 0:07:12,960
for children and campers that ensures appropriate social distancing. Staff who are not fully

75
0:07:12,960 --> 0:07:19,440
vaccinated must maintain a distance of at least six feet from other unvaccinated staff, right? So,

76
0:07:19,440 --> 0:07:23,760
that sort of requires you to know, unless you're going to make everyone distance,

77
0:07:24,400 --> 0:07:29,840
children and campers over the age of two and staff who are not fully vaccinated must wear

78
0:07:29,840 --> 0:07:34,880
face coverings, except when eating, drinking, showering, swimming, or sleeping, resting.

79
0:07:34,880 --> 0:07:40,880
Take a deep breath. And now, May 24th, we get an update and it hits right on some of these issues.

80
0:07:41,520 --> 0:07:48,480
Suddenly, it has changed. And I say suddenly, not to be judgmental, but the guidance is moving

81
0:07:48,480 --> 0:07:55,200
forward. Responsible parties should encourage children, campers aged to an older who are not fully

82
0:07:55,200 --> 0:08:01,280
vaccinated to wear face covering. Young children campers, those that are not in kindergarten,

83
0:08:01,280 --> 0:08:07,280
do not need to wear face coverings when they're in a child's care or a day camp program facility

84
0:08:07,280 --> 0:08:12,720
or area, right? So, it's getting a little bit different here. Children campers are not required

85
0:08:12,720 --> 0:08:19,280
to wear a face covering when utilizing the outdoor space that belongs to and or is exclusively

86
0:08:19,280 --> 0:08:26,960
used by the child care or a day camp program and then restricting saying face coverings must be

87
0:08:26,960 --> 0:08:32,480
worn by individuals who are not fully vaccinated during transportation, right? So, they're actually,

88
0:08:32,480 --> 0:08:37,520
at least here in New York State, if you read this guidance closely, it's not that easy to read that

89
0:08:37,520 --> 0:08:44,240
closely. But if the kids are there, if they're in that camp setting, in that child care setting,

90
0:08:44,240 --> 0:08:50,880
they do not necessarily need to have mass on when they're outdoors. And I think this evolves

91
0:08:50,880 --> 0:08:57,520
from some of the science we have talked about. Outdoors is a very safe place relative to other

92
0:08:57,520 --> 0:09:05,440
places. A proper translation of the research, I think, is that transmission is less than 1% in

93
0:09:05,440 --> 0:09:11,920
the outdoor area. So, outdoors in the summer, dropping prevalence, particularly here in New

94
0:09:11,920 --> 0:09:17,520
York State, these are all going to be really positive for our kids. I don't go that much into,

95
0:09:17,520 --> 0:09:22,160
I did go into a little in previous ones, but there is a mental health and all kinds of other

96
0:09:22,160 --> 0:09:26,880
challenges to having kids wear masks, having all these restrictions that our kids have

97
0:09:26,880 --> 0:09:33,680
gone through. And I always get angry emails when I talk about the fact that we have learned a lot

98
0:09:33,680 --> 0:09:40,160
about how we can actually get kids in these different settings, in camp, in school,

99
0:09:40,160 --> 0:09:46,240
how we can do it safely. Maybe sometimes the rates of infection are even lower when kids are allowed

100
0:09:46,240 --> 0:09:52,480
to go to school with the proper mitigation methods. Well, let's talk about that. There was a recent

101
0:09:52,480 --> 0:09:58,720
preprint that got a lot of headlines. So, let's go through this because I think it was misinterpreted

102
0:09:58,720 --> 0:10:03,920
a little bit. So, I want to actually go through what it actually said if one takes the time. So,

103
0:10:03,920 --> 0:10:12,640
this was the preprint COVID-19 mitigation practices and COVID-19 rates in schools report on data from

104
0:10:12,640 --> 0:10:20,320
Florida, New York, and Massachusetts. So, this was recently posted and the authors used data

105
0:10:20,320 --> 0:10:27,360
from the COVID-19 school response dashboard. Now, what is that? Now, this is a resource created

106
0:10:27,360 --> 0:10:34,080
with the organizing partners, the AASA, the school superintendents Association, the National Association

107
0:10:34,080 --> 0:10:38,320
of Secondary School Principles, the National Association of Elementary School Principles,

108
0:10:38,320 --> 0:10:43,600
Brown University Professor of Economics, Emily Oster. And this can actually be accessed. This is

109
0:10:44,400 --> 0:10:50,000
COVIDschool-board.com. You can go there and look at the data. But as the authors point out,

110
0:10:50,720 --> 0:10:55,040
they only looked at data from Florida, New York, and Massachusetts because

111
0:10:55,040 --> 0:11:01,280
as they in the COVID school dashboard report, this resource only contains consistent data for a

112
0:11:01,280 --> 0:11:06,080
limited number of states. There's actually a couple more that the COVID school dashboard has added.

113
0:11:06,960 --> 0:11:13,520
I will say that this paper will be much better after peer review. Despite several limitations,

114
0:11:13,520 --> 0:11:20,400
the authors point out what I agree, basically finding that there does seem to be a lower rate

115
0:11:20,400 --> 0:11:27,840
of COVID-19 for students being in school, suggesting that actually kids may be safer in school and

116
0:11:27,840 --> 0:11:33,360
then not in school. And this has been sort of an interesting touchy for when I discuss this with

117
0:11:33,360 --> 0:11:39,520
parent groups. You know, who would I trust with my children? Let's say the Port Washington School

118
0:11:39,520 --> 0:11:45,440
District or my wife, it would be my wife. But there is a dynamic that happens socially when our

119
0:11:45,440 --> 0:11:49,600
kids are isolated. We're trying to figure out ways for them to socially interact. And it is,

120
0:11:49,600 --> 0:11:54,000
it is hard and the school can can do it in such a way with actually get a degree of social

121
0:11:54,000 --> 0:11:58,160
interaction. Now, one of the things that was taken away from this, I will point out,

122
0:11:58,960 --> 0:12:05,680
is people said this study failed to show an impact of masking. So they only actually had

123
0:12:05,680 --> 0:12:10,720
mask mandate information for Florida. And I'll qualify that all they had was whether or not there

124
0:12:10,720 --> 0:12:15,360
was a mandate in place. There was no on the ground checking to see whether masks were being worn,

125
0:12:15,360 --> 0:12:21,280
not worn. There did seem to be a little bit of a signal to the teachers wearing masks.

126
0:12:22,160 --> 0:12:26,000
But I'm going to sort of leave it at that point, because we're going to hit some other, I think,

127
0:12:26,000 --> 0:12:30,560
data where we actually look at when they looked at masks ventilation, where they've actually shown

128
0:12:30,560 --> 0:12:36,000
that that is associated with a reduction in transmission. Pre-exposure transmission period,

129
0:12:36,000 --> 0:12:46,320
I really liked another early release that came out in the MMWR. And this was sort of shadowing this

130
0:12:46,320 --> 0:12:52,400
mask use and ventilation improvements to reduce COVID-19 incidents in elementary schools. And this

131
0:12:52,400 --> 0:13:01,440
was Georgia November 16 to December 11. Now, the authors reported that COVID-19 incidents was 37%

132
0:13:01,440 --> 0:13:09,440
lower in schools that required teachers and staff members to use masks and 39% lower in schools

133
0:13:09,440 --> 0:13:15,040
that improved ventilation. And the ventilation strategies associated with lower school incidents

134
0:13:15,040 --> 0:13:23,520
included dilution methods alone. That was 35% lower incidence. Or in combination with filtration

135
0:13:23,520 --> 0:13:29,520
methods, that was a 48% lower incidence. So using things like those HEPA filtration systems. So

136
0:13:29,520 --> 0:13:35,440
in this study, the authors used data from the Georgia kindergarten through grade five K through

137
0:13:35,440 --> 0:13:42,880
five schools that opened for in-person learning during fall 2020. And they reported on huge study

138
0:13:42,880 --> 0:13:50,240
169 K through five schools that participated in a survey on prevention strategies and recorded

139
0:13:50,240 --> 0:13:58,240
COVID-19 cases during November 16 to December 11, 2020. And so the Georgia Department of Public

140
0:13:58,240 --> 0:14:04,240
Health required all Georgia schools to submit weekly data on the aggregate number of COVID-19

141
0:14:04,240 --> 0:14:11,680
cases among students and staff members. And this analysis was based on 1,321 public K through five

142
0:14:11,680 --> 0:14:17,920
schools, 140 private K through five schools. And prevention strategies assessed included mask

143
0:14:17,920 --> 0:14:24,720
requirements for teachers, staff members, students, ventilation improvements, physical distancing of

144
0:14:24,720 --> 0:14:30,480
desks greater than six feet apart. Barriers on student desks, class size, number of students

145
0:14:30,480 --> 0:14:35,680
in a classroom, cohort size of small groups of students who stay together throughout the day

146
0:14:35,680 --> 0:14:41,280
during in-person learning, and number and locations of available hand washing stations.

147
0:14:42,320 --> 0:14:47,280
And I know the paper focused on masks and ventilation as far as their conclusions.

148
0:14:47,280 --> 0:14:50,880
But there's really interesting information if you go through the paper in detail,

149
0:14:50,880 --> 0:14:55,920
look at the tables. And in addition to sort of the conclusions, I point out a couple of things

150
0:14:55,920 --> 0:15:02,640
that I found interesting. The higher the county COVID-19 incidents, the higher the number of

151
0:15:02,640 --> 0:15:08,480
students that tested positive. So I think that's again what we've seen the community incidents

152
0:15:09,040 --> 0:15:14,480
actually ties in very directly with school incidents. And they also didn't really see an

153
0:15:14,480 --> 0:15:19,680
impact of that separating the desk by six feet. Basically the schools that did it and those that

154
0:15:19,680 --> 0:15:25,680
did not had the same incidents of COVID-19 per 500 students. So again, we've talked a little bit

155
0:15:25,680 --> 0:15:29,360
about do you need six feet? Can you get them three feet? Is that getting what you need?

156
0:15:30,000 --> 0:15:36,480
And we're seeing masks, three feet ventilation improvements, all these other testing, all these

157
0:15:36,480 --> 0:15:41,520
other strategies really are showing us that schools could be a really safe place even for

158
0:15:41,520 --> 0:15:47,520
unvaccinated children. And now that we're vaccinating adolescents, now that our rates are dropping,

159
0:15:47,520 --> 0:15:52,800
I think the sciences is supporting a lot of our progress in this area with getting kids

160
0:15:53,360 --> 0:15:59,120
back to schools, back to social interactions and camps. All right, testing never miss an

161
0:15:59,120 --> 0:16:03,760
opportunity to test. You know, I'm beginning to think that everyone should just subscribe to

162
0:16:03,760 --> 0:16:09,440
the CDC morbidity and mortality weekly reports. And I will say I also listened to there. They

163
0:16:09,440 --> 0:16:14,880
have a great weekly podcast if you don't like to read. You could do both. I do both. But there

164
0:16:14,880 --> 0:16:22,400
was another release in the MMWR. This one was entitled COVID-19 testing to sustain in-person

165
0:16:22,400 --> 0:16:28,880
instruction and extracurricular activities in high schools, Utah, November 2020 to March 2021.

166
0:16:29,760 --> 0:16:35,280
Now, for context, COVID-19 was associated with the cessation of kindergarten through grade 12

167
0:16:35,280 --> 0:16:40,640
in-person instruction and extracurricular activities. So most of us can agree that this

168
0:16:40,640 --> 0:16:45,920
had negative social, emotional, and educational consequences for our children. So what were they

169
0:16:45,920 --> 0:16:53,040
doing here? The authors reported on two high school COVID-19 testing programs that were created to

170
0:16:53,040 --> 0:16:59,920
sustain in-person instruction and allow for extracurricular activities. During November 30, 2020,

171
0:16:59,920 --> 0:17:11,040
through March 2021, among 59,552 students who received testing 3.2% had a positive result.

172
0:17:11,680 --> 0:17:15,840
So what they went through doing these programs, these programs that they put in place

173
0:17:15,840 --> 0:17:22,080
facilitated the completion of approximately 95% of the high school extracurricular competition

174
0:17:22,080 --> 0:17:30,640
events and saved an estimated 109,752 in-person instruction student days. So the authors were

175
0:17:30,640 --> 0:17:35,840
suggesting that school-based COVID-19 testing should be considered part of a comprehensive

176
0:17:35,840 --> 0:17:41,600
prevention strategy to identify SARS-CoV-2 infections in schools and sustain in-person

177
0:17:41,600 --> 0:17:47,360
instruction and extracurricular activities. So what did they actually do? Well, the schools

178
0:17:47,360 --> 0:17:54,480
implemented these two high school testing programs. Test to play and test to stay. So I love how

179
0:17:54,480 --> 0:18:02,240
catchy these are. So test to play. This was where there was testing every 14 days mandated for

180
0:18:02,240 --> 0:18:08,560
participation in extracurricular activities. That doesn't seem very often, right, every 14 days.

181
0:18:08,560 --> 0:18:16,000
Test to stay involved school-wide testing to continue in-person instruction as an alternative

182
0:18:16,000 --> 0:18:21,600
to transitioning to remote instruction if a school crossed a defined outbreak threshold,

183
0:18:21,600 --> 0:18:26,080
right? So these are areas where we're starting to see increased incidence. They're jumping in

184
0:18:26,080 --> 0:18:34,000
with these testing strategies during November 30, 2020 through March 20, 2021. As I mentioned,

185
0:18:34,000 --> 0:18:41,440
59,552 students were tested through these programs at over 100 of Utah's public schools.

186
0:18:41,440 --> 0:18:48,640
They implemented rapid antigen testing. Now with rising rates of COVID-19 in Utah,

187
0:18:48,640 --> 0:18:55,440
a November 9 statewide COVID-19 restrictions were ordered, and part of that was a cessation of

188
0:18:55,440 --> 0:19:02,080
extracurricular activities. That was when test to play was introduced. And in December 2020,

189
0:19:02,080 --> 0:19:09,680
test to stay was piloted at two high schools. And beginning January 4, 2021, schools crossing the

190
0:19:09,680 --> 0:19:16,160
outbake threshold could choose to implement test to stay as an alternative to transitioning to

191
0:19:16,160 --> 0:19:20,320
remote instruction. And a number of the schools jumped in. They took advantage of this. They

192
0:19:20,320 --> 0:19:27,600
were given free test kits, training, testing assistance, help implementing these programs,

193
0:19:28,320 --> 0:19:34,400
and the authors point out with their conclusions that this approach can serve as a framework for

194
0:19:34,400 --> 0:19:41,360
other schools wanting to have kids back in school for sustained in-person instruction

195
0:19:41,360 --> 0:19:47,520
and continued extracurricular activities. Active vaccination. Never miss an opportunity

196
0:19:47,520 --> 0:19:53,680
to vaccinate. And I also say vaccines are how this pandemic ends. And I'm going to start here

197
0:19:53,680 --> 0:19:58,880
with with the story. I actually every so often get upset. I may seem calm and level headed all

198
0:19:58,880 --> 0:20:04,880
times because sometimes things get me a little bit upset. And this was a patient of mine taking

199
0:20:04,880 --> 0:20:10,480
care of her several times in the past. I've known her for a while. She is homebound. So she was

200
0:20:10,480 --> 0:20:17,200
homebound. And she was very excited to get vaccinated. But her primary care physician was

201
0:20:17,200 --> 0:20:22,640
not aware of how to access one of these programs to get a homebound person vaccinated.

202
0:20:22,640 --> 0:20:29,280
And this frustrates me because I will say a lot of people are jumping into this space and trying

203
0:20:29,280 --> 0:20:34,000
to help actually north well. One of our large healthcare systems here is actually set up a

204
0:20:34,000 --> 0:20:40,000
program where physicians can reach out, connect their patient, and personnel will go out to the

205
0:20:40,000 --> 0:20:46,400
residents and vaccinate these homebound people in their home. So these exist. These programs

206
0:20:46,400 --> 0:20:50,720
exist. So if you are taking care of patients, if you have someone you care about who's homebound,

207
0:20:50,720 --> 0:20:55,760
who can't get to a vaccine site, start making those calls. Let's let's get these people vaccinated.

208
0:20:55,760 --> 0:21:01,760
But so while she's waiting, unable to get vaccinated, she is homebound. And she is being taken care of

209
0:21:01,760 --> 0:21:08,960
by a home health aide who happens to be an anti-vaxxer. The home healthcare aid gets COVID. The home

210
0:21:08,960 --> 0:21:16,720
healthcare aid infects our patient, my patient. And now my patient who is unvaccinated is in the

211
0:21:16,720 --> 0:21:24,400
hospital on steroids, on remdesivir, on anticoagulation, on oxygen. And just this very much could be

212
0:21:24,400 --> 0:21:29,600
avoided. The other thing that didn't happen there is after she was exposed, started to get sick,

213
0:21:30,400 --> 0:21:35,760
monoclonals were not given. And I think I pointed out too, monoclonals, we have programs for

214
0:21:35,760 --> 0:21:40,960
delivering those in the home for homebound individuals as well. So she missed her opportunity to get

215
0:21:40,960 --> 0:21:46,240
vaccinated. She missed her opportunity to get monoclonals. And you know, it's upsetting to me.

216
0:21:46,240 --> 0:21:49,680
I understand that people want to make decisions. But when you make a decision,

217
0:21:49,680 --> 0:21:54,320
that ends up putting someone else in the hospital that I find very difficult.

218
0:21:54,320 --> 0:22:00,320
On May 25th, we heard from Moderna with the press release. Moderna announces teen COVE

219
0:22:00,320 --> 0:22:06,800
study of its COVID-19 vaccine in adolescence meets primary endpoint. And they plan to submit data

220
0:22:06,800 --> 0:22:15,200
to regulators in early June to expand the EUA down to 12 years of age for Moderna. Now,

221
0:22:15,200 --> 0:22:23,120
this was a phase two, three study in 3,732 adolescent participants aged 12 to less than 18.

222
0:22:24,160 --> 0:22:30,480
And they were randomized two to one to 200 microgram doses of the mRNA 1273,

223
0:22:30,480 --> 0:22:37,600
so the Moderna vaccine or placebo. And the primary endpoint was non-inferior immunogenicity versus

224
0:22:37,600 --> 0:22:44,880
the phase three adult study comparator that was met after two doses. No cases of COVID-19 were

225
0:22:44,880 --> 0:22:50,560
observed in the vaccine group using the case definition from the adult phase three COVE study.

226
0:22:51,120 --> 0:22:56,720
Compared to four cases in the placebo group, resulting in a vaccine efficacy of 100% starting

227
0:22:56,720 --> 0:23:02,480
14 days after the second dose. Keep in mind those numbers, right? So you want to hang your hat on

228
0:23:02,480 --> 0:23:08,960
that. Because the incidence rate of COVID-19 is lower in adolescence, a secondary case definition

229
0:23:08,960 --> 0:23:15,840
based on CDC definition of COVID-19 was also evaluated to include cases presenting with milder

230
0:23:15,840 --> 0:23:23,760
symptoms. So using the CDC definition, which requires only one symptom and a nasopharyngeal

231
0:23:23,760 --> 0:23:30,960
swab or saliva sample positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR, we got a vaccine efficacy of 93%

232
0:23:30,960 --> 0:23:40,800
after the first dose. The Moderna vaccine was well tolerated with really the same safety profile

233
0:23:40,800 --> 0:23:45,280
that we saw in adults. That was really positive, kind of nice. We're going to have some more options

234
0:23:45,280 --> 0:23:51,200
eventually. The FDA also, this is, this actually is pretty big. They authorized a longer time for

235
0:23:51,200 --> 0:23:59,440
refrigerator storage of the THOD Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine prior to dilution. So if people

236
0:23:59,440 --> 0:24:05,760
have ever worked with this, these come in a non-deluded vial and then you have a little normal

237
0:24:05,760 --> 0:24:10,880
saline that you use to dilute that before you administer it. You can take that out of the deep

238
0:24:10,880 --> 0:24:17,600
freeze thermal shippers. You can leave it in a normal refrigerator for up to a month. I don't

239
0:24:17,600 --> 0:24:24,480
know if that's 30 or 31 days or 28 if it's February, but no, it's 30 days in a normal medical refrigerator.

240
0:24:24,480 --> 0:24:30,400
And there's now an updated fact sheet with this modification. One still needs to get that into

241
0:24:30,400 --> 0:24:35,600
arms within six hours after you dilute that. So that is a little different than Moderna. Once

242
0:24:35,600 --> 0:24:42,800
you puncture a Moderna vial, you've got 12 hours. The other thing in here is that normally you had

243
0:24:42,800 --> 0:24:49,120
to order over 1,000 of the Pfizer BioNTech vaccines and this big thermal shipper. You can order

244
0:24:49,120 --> 0:24:54,720
half thermal shippers, so about 600 or so. And also we have programs I think I mentioned here in

245
0:24:54,720 --> 0:25:00,800
New York where you can actually partner with other organizations and get as little as 40 or 50

246
0:25:00,800 --> 0:25:05,360
doses where someone else is taking another 40 or 50 doses and a number of practices are working

247
0:25:05,360 --> 0:25:10,400
together so that we can start offering this in the pediatrician's office in more of the primary

248
0:25:10,400 --> 0:25:17,760
care setting offices. So this is really huge for helping us improve access. The period of

249
0:25:17,760 --> 0:25:23,840
detectable viral replication or the viral symptom phase, as I like to say, the time for monitoring

250
0:25:23,840 --> 0:25:30,320
and monoclonals and NSAIDs are fine for symptomatic relief. I'm going to tell another story here and

251
0:25:30,320 --> 0:25:35,520
this was kind of an interesting story. I see a lot of individuals who are suffering from long

252
0:25:35,520 --> 0:25:42,080
COVID and this person was actually interesting. I don't see a lot of this, but this was an individual

253
0:25:42,080 --> 0:25:49,120
who got sick in early January. This was an older man, late 70s, a number of health problems.

254
0:25:49,840 --> 0:25:55,120
And he actually got monoclonals, maybe a little bit late, about day eight, but he actually went on

255
0:25:55,120 --> 0:26:02,400
to develop long COVID. And so I first saw this gentleman about seven weeks ago. And at that

256
0:26:02,400 --> 0:26:07,360
point in time, we talked and I usually tell people, hey, why don't we go ahead and let's try

257
0:26:07,360 --> 0:26:12,400
see if vaccination will have any impact here. It was really, I have to say, this was very pleasant

258
0:26:12,400 --> 0:26:17,120
Tuesday in the afternoon in the office, because this gentleman got on and just basically said,

259
0:26:17,120 --> 0:26:22,720
Dr. Griffin, it was like switching in the lights. I am completely better. I have no more symptoms.

260
0:26:22,720 --> 0:26:27,280
Thank you. We don't need to see each other anymore. So sort of two issues there. One was actually,

261
0:26:27,280 --> 0:26:33,840
I do not often see people with long COVID after monoclonals. I have actually seen several just

262
0:26:33,840 --> 0:26:39,440
to and we're analyzing our data to see what the incidence is or if there is an impact on long

263
0:26:39,440 --> 0:26:44,960
COVID to getting monoclonals. So we'll have that data, hopefully, to share real data, not just this

264
0:26:44,960 --> 0:26:52,560
story, but also, again, really nice to see another individual who had this really nice timing of

265
0:26:52,560 --> 0:26:58,480
recovery after vaccination. All right, another monoclonal option just got EUA this week, right?

266
0:26:58,480 --> 0:27:07,520
So more options here. GSK and VIR Biotech announced Sotra VIMAB. So this is VIR7831.

267
0:27:07,520 --> 0:27:13,920
I'm not sure their name is easier to say than VIR7831, but Sotra VIMAB received EUA

268
0:27:15,040 --> 0:27:19,520
for treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in high-risk adults and pediatric patients.

269
0:27:20,080 --> 0:27:24,240
This is actually based on data that we've discussed before. This was the common trial data

270
0:27:24,240 --> 0:27:30,720
with an 85% reduction in risk of hospitalization or death. And I actually want to point out,

271
0:27:30,720 --> 0:27:38,080
and this is in the EUA in the announcement, is that Sotra VIMAB maintains activity against all

272
0:27:38,080 --> 0:27:45,760
known variants of concern, including that triple mutant variant from India. So that is nice to say.

273
0:27:45,760 --> 0:27:51,280
Monoclonal access is actually now expanded, and the wording now is,

274
0:27:51,280 --> 0:27:56,480
healthcare providers can now consider the benefit risk for an individual patient

275
0:27:56,480 --> 0:28:01,520
using the fact sheet for healthcare providers and the CDC website as guidance. So now we're

276
0:28:01,520 --> 0:28:06,080
saying you can look at giving this to your high-risk patients. You don't necessarily have to check

277
0:28:06,080 --> 0:28:11,920
that box. We talked about BMI of 25. So maybe it's a BMI of 24. You're going to use your

278
0:28:11,920 --> 0:28:18,320
judgment there. Maybe they're not 65, but they're 63. Is that close enough? So we're seeing a little

279
0:28:18,320 --> 0:28:23,280
bit of realization that there's no reason to let these products sit on the shelf, considering

280
0:28:23,280 --> 0:28:28,400
how incredibly effective they can be and how safe they have been. But remember, the monoclonal

281
0:28:28,400 --> 0:28:35,280
cocktails are not authorized for and probably are not a benefit for people who have missed the window

282
0:28:35,280 --> 0:28:40,160
and are already hospitalized due to COVID-19, who require oxygen therapy, because they've gotten

283
0:28:40,160 --> 0:28:45,280
into that early inflammatory phase, or who have chronic oxygen needs and now have an increased

284
0:28:45,280 --> 0:28:51,600
requirement. And, you know, and this is in, is that monoclonals actually may be associated with

285
0:28:51,600 --> 0:28:56,320
worse clinical outcomes when administered to hospitalized patients with COVID-19 requiring

286
0:28:56,320 --> 0:29:02,240
high-flow oxygen or mechanical ventilation. So we go from a window of opportunity to a time

287
0:29:02,240 --> 0:29:06,480
when that is closed, actually a time when we may be harming our patients by using these. So

288
0:29:07,120 --> 0:29:12,000
this isn't something that you want to just ban for your relative. You need an educated clinician

289
0:29:12,000 --> 0:29:16,640
helping make the decision about whether or not this is going to be a life-saving, a beneficial,

290
0:29:16,640 --> 0:29:21,120
or even an harmful intervention. One of the management decisions that I often struggle

291
0:29:21,120 --> 0:29:25,760
with during this time, and I'm still going to say after this, I still struggle with this,

292
0:29:25,760 --> 0:29:32,000
is, is there a role for aspirin in the outpatient setting? And there was an article,

293
0:29:32,000 --> 0:29:38,640
active prescription of low dose aspirin during or prior to hospitalization and mortality in COVID-19,

294
0:29:38,640 --> 0:29:45,440
a systematic review and meta-analysis of adjusted effect estimates. And this was published in the

295
0:29:45,440 --> 0:29:50,240
International Journal of Infectious Diseases. And I actually spent a lot of time analyzing this

296
0:29:50,240 --> 0:29:55,040
paper to really see if I could come away with a conclusion. So this was a meta-analysis,

297
0:29:55,760 --> 0:30:00,560
which our listeners may recall is what you, when you get, you take a whole bunch of studies and

298
0:30:00,560 --> 0:30:04,880
you stack them on one on top of another and maybe each study isn't so great. But when you get them

299
0:30:04,880 --> 0:30:10,080
all together, you reach a certain height and they miraculously turn into gold. That is not the case.

300
0:30:10,800 --> 0:30:18,960
The authors report too have found six eligible studies comprising 13,993 patients, right? So that,

301
0:30:18,960 --> 0:30:23,680
that's not an impressive. That's, oh, this is great. But let's be fair. When you actually start

302
0:30:23,680 --> 0:30:30,560
reading the article, you realize that 12,600 of those patients come from just one study. And then

303
0:30:30,560 --> 0:30:38,320
the other studies all have only between 48 and 638 patients, really making this a sort of a

304
0:30:38,320 --> 0:30:44,960
re-analysis of that huge study. And what was that huge study with the 12,600? That was

305
0:30:44,960 --> 0:30:50,320
association of mortality and aspirin prescriptions for COVID-19 patients at the Veterans Health

306
0:30:50,320 --> 0:30:56,320
Administration that was published back in February. And if you look at that, what did they do? They

307
0:30:56,320 --> 0:31:01,280
did not actually look in that study at people getting aspirin for the treatment of COVID.

308
0:31:01,280 --> 0:31:07,280
They just looked at veterans in a database and said, who was on aspirin prior to getting COVID?

309
0:31:08,400 --> 0:31:13,120
And then they looked at their outcomes versus the outcomes of those people who were not prescribed

310
0:31:13,120 --> 0:31:18,960
aspirin. So I'm really left without any certainty regarding a benefit or even harm with routine use

311
0:31:18,960 --> 0:31:24,320
of aspirin. So I'm going to leave this in sort of the clinical judgment realm. No real good science

312
0:31:24,320 --> 0:31:29,120
helping us. And we do. We need good science helping us with aspirin and a platelet agents

313
0:31:29,120 --> 0:31:33,520
and a coagulation. All right. So now we're going to get to the tail. We're going to jump way ahead

314
0:31:33,520 --> 0:31:37,280
here to the tail. I don't feel like I have any other new things to jump in on some of these other

315
0:31:37,280 --> 0:31:45,440
areas. But we have information out of the UK on children and COVID. And I think this is important

316
0:31:45,440 --> 0:31:51,680
to sort of get things in context. So one of the things we now think we have a sense is the case,

317
0:31:51,680 --> 0:31:58,320
or I'll say the infection hospitalization rate for children. We don't really know the case or

318
0:31:58,320 --> 0:32:02,960
the actual infection. We have the cases. But let's look at this study. So illustration and

319
0:32:02,960 --> 0:32:10,800
symptom profile in a large cohort of symptomatic UK school aged children tested for SARS-CoV-2.

320
0:32:10,800 --> 0:32:16,240
This was posted in a preprint. So it hasn't gone through peer review yet. And the authors here

321
0:32:16,240 --> 0:32:24,240
reported on 1,734 children with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result. And they had information on

322
0:32:24,240 --> 0:32:28,320
illness duration within the study timeframe. Right? Because they wanted to be able to ask the

323
0:32:28,320 --> 0:32:34,320
question of these kids who get COVID, how long are they sick? We got a little bit of information

324
0:32:34,320 --> 0:32:41,680
on symptoms. The most common symptom was headache. That was 62.2%. Fatigue was a little over half,

325
0:32:41,680 --> 0:32:49,360
55%. And the median acute illness duration was six days. But that was a little bit different.

326
0:32:49,360 --> 0:32:53,920
Seven days if you were older, five days if you were younger, as far as symptom duration. So

327
0:32:53,920 --> 0:32:57,920
here, what are we looking at? We're looking at what kids went on to have prolonged symptoms.

328
0:32:58,560 --> 0:33:04,240
4.4% of the children had an illness duration of greater than 28 days.

329
0:33:05,760 --> 0:33:10,320
More commonly experienced by the older versus the younger children. So if you looked at the

330
0:33:10,320 --> 0:33:17,200
older, it was actually about 5.1%. And the younger about 3.1%. So sort of a trend there.

331
0:33:17,200 --> 0:33:22,720
The common symptoms experienced by these children for this prolonged period of time past 28 days

332
0:33:22,720 --> 0:33:29,760
was 84%. 80% of them were reporting headaches. 80% of them were reporting a lack of ability to

333
0:33:29,760 --> 0:33:38,480
smell. When we got out to greater than 56 days, 1.8% of the children were still experiencing symptoms.

334
0:33:38,480 --> 0:33:44,000
So I'm going to avoid using words like only or just. But this gives us a sense of the risk here.

335
0:33:45,040 --> 0:33:53,120
Kids got COVID. About 4.4% of them were still having symptoms about a month out. Once we got

336
0:33:53,120 --> 0:34:00,880
to about two months out, 1.8% of the kids had continued symptoms. So this is suggesting that

337
0:34:00,880 --> 0:34:09,040
the incidence of long COVID or post cutes quality of COVID is lower in children than adults. The

338
0:34:09,040 --> 0:34:13,840
symptom burden in these children didn't increase. They did not get worse. And as we saw as we went

339
0:34:13,840 --> 0:34:19,520
from 30 days to 60 days, we actually had a lower percentage of kids continuing to report

340
0:34:20,240 --> 0:34:23,920
any symptoms there. I'm going to finish with one. Actually, this was sort of a hot off the

341
0:34:23,920 --> 0:34:27,920
press story that I thought was interesting. And I'll just leave this for people to speculate on.

342
0:34:27,920 --> 0:34:35,600
I have a patient still taking care of her in the hospital. And she got sick back in December.

343
0:34:36,240 --> 0:34:42,800
And she has a number of autoimmune diseases. She's on some immunosuppressive medicine. It had been

344
0:34:42,800 --> 0:34:49,680
quite a period of time. And about a month ago, we decided to repeat her PCR this time quantitatively,

345
0:34:49,680 --> 0:34:54,160
right? Because we've been positive PCR forever. And we really been looking at the literature. And

346
0:34:54,160 --> 0:34:59,920
a lot of the suggestions, boy, once you get past about 10, maybe 20 days, you have a positive PCR,

347
0:34:59,920 --> 0:35:06,560
but it's really just low level. And in this individual, the PCR came back in the 20s, actually

348
0:35:06,560 --> 0:35:14,720
translating into about 45 million RNA copies, quite surprised at how high this was. We discussed

349
0:35:14,720 --> 0:35:19,680
with her and her sons that we really had no evidence-based interventions to offer them.

350
0:35:19,680 --> 0:35:24,480
And we then moved on to a discussion of what are we going to do in the future so that this

351
0:35:24,480 --> 0:35:29,040
woman doesn't get reinfected, right? Not clear that she's mounting any great response.

352
0:35:30,080 --> 0:35:35,600
And so they were concerned about vaccination. She had had some prior issues with vaccination.

353
0:35:35,600 --> 0:35:41,600
And we decided, as a joint shared decision-making, that the safest place to go ahead with vaccination

354
0:35:41,600 --> 0:35:47,760
was while she was still in the hospital before she was discharged. She received the J and J vaccine,

355
0:35:47,760 --> 0:35:54,320
which really tolerated without any event. And today was about 10 days after that dose.

356
0:35:55,280 --> 0:36:01,280
And we've been trying to look at our options for sending this woman to different facilities.

357
0:36:01,280 --> 0:36:07,200
And we repeated the PCR today, and it was negative. Very exciting. We're going to repeat it again

358
0:36:07,200 --> 0:36:13,200
tomorrow. So sort of interesting. One of those observations, is it true that that's related

359
0:36:13,200 --> 0:36:17,920
to the vaccine? Do we just finally get to that threshold? But for me, very encouraging. After

360
0:36:17,920 --> 0:36:23,120
this very long odyssey, this woman is potentially going to leave the hospital vaccinated.

361
0:36:23,120 --> 0:36:27,120
I will leave it there and just remind everyone, drop what you're doing if you love what we do.

362
0:36:28,000 --> 0:36:33,280
Or if you love what FIMRIC does, we are still continuing to help support Foundation International

363
0:36:33,280 --> 0:36:37,760
Medical Relief of Children. And this is really a tremendous organization that I've worked with

364
0:36:37,760 --> 0:36:43,440
for years with sites throughout the world, really making a difference in so many people's lives.

365
0:36:43,440 --> 0:36:47,520
And really the mission that I love, they go to these places, they ask the people there,

366
0:36:47,520 --> 0:36:52,320
what do you need? What can we do to help you? And then they work with those communities to try to

367
0:36:52,320 --> 0:36:57,280
meet those needs. So go to parasites without borders.com and help us support them and continue our work.

368
0:36:57,920 --> 0:37:05,120
Time for some emails for Daniel. If you want to send one in, Daniel at microbe.tv. Bill writes,

369
0:37:05,120 --> 0:37:11,200
my 13 year old son just received Gardasil vaccine. And with the approval for COVID for kids,

370
0:37:11,200 --> 0:37:16,720
we'd like to get him vaccinated ASAP. Is there a waiting period we should adhere to between different

371
0:37:16,720 --> 0:37:24,000
viral vaccinations? So that has been that two week waiting period has been removed.

372
0:37:24,000 --> 0:37:28,560
Early on, I always said, don't ever let that stand in the way. Try to sort of space things

373
0:37:28,560 --> 0:37:33,440
two weeks out. But now they basically said, no, we have enough of an observation. We have enough

374
0:37:33,440 --> 0:37:39,200
science here. We know what we see with different vaccines. Go ahead, get that COVID-19 vaccine

375
0:37:39,200 --> 0:37:44,000
as soon as possible. Peter Wright, I'm an anesthesiologist and dentist here in New York's

376
0:37:44,000 --> 0:37:51,120
good neighbor, Toronto, Ontario. So I was thankful to have had AstraZeneca first vaccine nine weeks

377
0:37:51,120 --> 0:37:56,800
ago, no sequela. I was diagnosed with polycythemia Vira three years ago, managed with ASA and every

378
0:37:56,800 --> 0:38:03,120
other month phlebotomy, because I turned 65 in late March protocols or be or to begin hydroxyurea

379
0:38:03,120 --> 0:38:09,280
500 milligrams. I've been delaying starting my hydroxyurea till after I have my second vaccination,

380
0:38:09,280 --> 0:38:15,360
thinking it may probably compromise my immune response with all the changing data regarding

381
0:38:15,360 --> 0:38:20,560
from thrombotic events after the first AstraZeneca dose and preliminary reports regarding the

382
0:38:20,560 --> 0:38:26,400
incident after second dose. Interested in your thoughts regarding the second vaccine and the timing

383
0:38:26,400 --> 0:38:33,760
of hydroxyurea? Yeah, I mean, I I'm not sure that I sort of thinking through the immunology would be

384
0:38:33,760 --> 0:38:39,040
concerned, but but that's not really the way we want to approach this. If you can go ahead and get

385
0:38:39,040 --> 0:38:43,920
that vaccine, if it's fine to delay a little bit before you switch over the hydroxyurea,

386
0:38:43,920 --> 0:38:49,600
that would probably be my personal preference. All right. And finally, from Jackie, I'm a pediatric

387
0:38:49,600 --> 0:38:54,480
nurse practitioner. I do medical administration work for a large federally qualified health

388
0:38:54,480 --> 0:39:00,080
center in Philadelphia. My colleagues and I love your show. So Jackie has a bunch of questions.

389
0:39:00,800 --> 0:39:05,760
Let's see how many we can get through. Now that we have J&J, now that we know J&J has caused about

390
0:39:05,760 --> 0:39:11,200
28ish cases of blood clots, could you help us compare risks to the background in the general

391
0:39:11,200 --> 0:39:18,080
population, people with COVID and J&J recipients? Yes, I think that's an excellent question.

392
0:39:18,080 --> 0:39:22,800
You know, when they went through the analysis of J&J and now, and I think this is evidence,

393
0:39:22,800 --> 0:39:27,920
again, we have a really robust vaccine monitoring system. So we had the initial numbers we've now

394
0:39:27,920 --> 0:39:35,840
seen, as mentioned, a number of other cases in a slightly broader demographic. The risk is still

395
0:39:35,840 --> 0:39:41,520
low. It is still, you know, less than one in 100,000, you know, people is at one in 100,000,

396
0:39:41,520 --> 0:39:46,720
one in 500,000, there are probably a little subtleties on teasing that out. But the risk

397
0:39:46,720 --> 0:39:52,560
is incredibly rare. We've talked about that maybe being lower if we avoid women under the age of

398
0:39:52,560 --> 0:39:58,720
50, right? So then maybe we get into a lower risk here. But you compare that to the risk of getting

399
0:39:58,720 --> 0:40:03,840
COVID, the risk of complications if you get COVID. And that's what I tell people. I had a very

400
0:40:03,840 --> 0:40:08,880
interesting rather long discussion with a patient who's actually a patient who had an

401
0:40:08,880 --> 0:40:15,040
adolescent son, who had a developmental disorder. And, you know, and I said to her, listen,

402
0:40:15,600 --> 0:40:20,400
there's a, you're making a decision either way, you're either deciding to get the vaccine,

403
0:40:20,400 --> 0:40:24,880
or you're deciding to take the risk of getting COVID and the complications that come with that.

404
0:40:25,840 --> 0:40:31,520
Boy, the risk of any vaccine is so much smaller than the risk of getting COVID during a pandemic

405
0:40:31,520 --> 0:40:33,520
and all the complications that come from that.

406
0:40:33,520 --> 0:40:38,640
Jackie, second question is about guidance for 12 to 15 year old group with regard to vaccination.

407
0:40:38,640 --> 0:40:44,400
But that's answered, right? Both mRNA vaccines are authorized now for that age.

408
0:40:44,400 --> 0:40:50,080
Just so currently just Pfizer, but Moderna is in the works for expansion. So they requested

409
0:40:50,080 --> 0:40:54,800
every question. Yeah. So she should go should be any day now then, right?

410
0:40:56,480 --> 0:41:01,840
You know, there's a period of when, when you request, they have to wait 15 days,

411
0:41:01,840 --> 0:41:06,480
and then the FDA can grant it. So we're ending May, it'll be in June.

412
0:41:07,920 --> 0:41:11,920
All right, could you talk a little bit about giving routine vaccinations along with COVID?

413
0:41:11,920 --> 0:41:16,000
When will that be approved? I'd love to do 16 year old checkups over the summer. Give

414
0:41:16,000 --> 0:41:21,680
that meningitis number two shot along with a stray HEP or an HPV plus COVID.

415
0:41:21,680 --> 0:41:26,160
That would be my ideal universe as a pediatric nurse practitioner.

416
0:41:27,280 --> 0:41:32,400
Well, we live in that world right here already, and we've lifted that space in

417
0:41:32,400 --> 0:41:37,200
them apart. Go ahead. If you can get them in, if this is an opportunity to get those vaccines

418
0:41:37,200 --> 0:41:41,280
into arms, you do not need to space them apart. This is absolutely fine.

419
0:41:42,080 --> 0:41:45,680
And finally, could you talk a little bit more about monoclonal therapy? How to get

420
0:41:45,680 --> 0:41:51,360
patients access? I know this is a mundane concern. Transportation is an issue for many patients,

421
0:41:51,360 --> 0:41:55,280
and now you have a symptomatic patient. You've told the isolate how you're going to get them from

422
0:41:55,280 --> 0:42:00,960
their home to the infusion center. How about therapy for children? Yeah, so this, this is,

423
0:42:00,960 --> 0:42:06,400
as I said, we've expanded this a little bit out, but still it's, it's limited, right below 18.

424
0:42:06,400 --> 0:42:10,800
It's probably 18 enough that really is broadened. There are certain number of indications for the

425
0:42:10,800 --> 0:42:16,960
under-17 crowd. We have programs where you can get these in the home. What's going to be really

426
0:42:16,960 --> 0:42:22,640
exciting and what a lot of people are working on is IM and sub-Q injection. So what can we do

427
0:42:22,640 --> 0:42:26,320
right now? So right now, a lot of times it might be actually going, I'll say here in the New York

428
0:42:26,320 --> 0:42:32,000
area, the Catholic health system do a great job of basically to show up at an ER and you can get

429
0:42:32,000 --> 0:42:37,920
access. Northwell Health, one of our largest health systems here, actually has, you know,

430
0:42:37,920 --> 0:42:43,280
the physician goes online, fills out some forms, and yes, the person would have to go to a tent

431
0:42:43,280 --> 0:42:50,880
outside of an ER. For certain individuals, you can call the number and you can actually get

432
0:42:50,880 --> 0:42:55,600
set up in home infusion, but we're hoping this is going to be something where, you know, a call

433
0:42:55,600 --> 0:43:01,280
can go out to a pharmacy, something can be delivered to the home. One of the challenges still is that

434
0:43:01,280 --> 0:43:06,080
rare, right, one in several thousand anaphylactic reactions. So if you're going to do it in the home,

435
0:43:06,080 --> 0:43:11,440
you're probably still going to want someone who can be there to, you know, administer an EpiPen

436
0:43:11,440 --> 0:43:16,960
and get Benadryl, you know, treat an anaphylactic reaction. That's COVID-19 clinical update number

437
0:43:16,960 --> 0:43:36,640
64 with Dr. Daniel Griffin. Thank you, Daniel. Oh, thank you so much and everyone be safe.
