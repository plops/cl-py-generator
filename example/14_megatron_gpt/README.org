{"text": "I'm not sure I'd classify myself as a cuddly 'noisy' person. If anyone tells me I'm an 'unsofty' I'm not one to believe them. At work, I tend to stick to some sort of voluntary quiet if that isn't possible. One of my best friends - who was born to be in a bubble of tranquility - when they moved to New York in '97, only really did this once or twice a year. They are all so different - he wasn't remotely like me, she's a bit nuts, he's quiet and loves to watch movies. I'm always on the go.\nOccasionally I get the urge to just chill out, to just sit and watch a bit of TV, something that seems so totally off the agenda. How does someone do that?\nTRAINING WITH PAIN: GET PAIN-FREE WORKHIRE\nWorking with pain is the easiest and most challenging thing you can do, but I don't think it's as easy as you think.\nTo practice, you first need to get yourself going. Yes, it's not going to be easy for you to not do it every day, but it's going to be good for you in the long run.\nThat first step is to sit down with yourself, and come up with something you're good at - something that is your focus and that's the one thing that you are focusing on. Now try to think about why you're doing it, ask yourself questions like, 'Is this to help me improve my technique? To challenge myself to change my approach to work? To improve my work environment?'\nDoing something you are good at and challenging yourself to change your approach to work is the key.\nThen, after that, you need to create a routine of how you use your energy and your thoughts. This will take some time and work, but it's good exercise. The thing is, you have to start somewhere.\nFrom the beginning, it is very important that you have a routine of what you're working towards, and what you're going to focus on, and why you're focusing on it. When you have that ritual in place, all your eyes are off you. You don't see yourself doing anything. Instead of focusing on your thoughts, the picture has changed. What you are thinking is no longer what you're thinking. Instead of focussing on your thoughts, you're going to start to notice those thoughts and focus on what you're thinking about.\nHow did you set up your routine?\nAt first I used to only work with clients and clients' assistants. It was relatively hard work but I found that it was a lot easier than the actual bit of work that I did. The repetition of things always happens. I would get calls and emails and then go back to work. Eventually I found it easier to work from home, or in an office or something that I was comfortable with. And then once you do it, you realise it's not very hard. It's good work, just like what I do.\nIs there a key that you look to to make the most of your work?\nI'm very conscious of how my energy flows.\nHow much energy does your mind and body carry, and how much energy does your thoughts carry?\nA lot of the energy in the brain is coming from the way we talk to each other. We tend to talk a lot to ourselves. We talk to each other about things that make us laugh, or bring us joy. This is a natural way of talking to yourself, and we don't really understand why we do that. It's very odd, because we do think that it's funny, but when we try to put it into words, we find it's very difficult to understand what we're saying.\nSo what are some of the tips you've found to improve your energy flow?\nJust stop talking and stop listening. Don't over-talk yourself. This is when we start to talk too much. There are things that you can do, though, to improve your energy flow. Start by listening, like if someone is talking to you about a problem, let them talk. The more time you spend being interested in their problem, the more you will see problems as solutions.\nThe same applies to your thoughts. When you think about a problem, don't think about how you're going to solve the problem. Instead, think about how you want to solve the problem. It can help you relax and work with your mind, rather than being distracted by the problem itself.\nThis is also to stop thinking about problems as being a source of frustration and frustration. Even though your problem might seem to be solved, it's not. It's only when you stop and look at it objectively that you see the problem.\nThese are all things that you have to pay attention to, because you never know when the problem could come up again, and you don't know how", "length": 1022, "finished": false}
{"text": "Enter the world of the living mobile\nThe new Morpheus IEC-2011 was the most technologically advanced container-based mobile telephone. With a big image projector, you can see what is happening in the real world in real time.\nThis cool piece of equipment is a hybrid being used in the city of Granada, in the northern Spain area of Cordoba. The \"Granada Mobile City Line\" is an initiative by the Granada Information Systems, which is headed by Dr. Pere Gutjans. It's an educational technology centre, where everybody can learn about this new mobile telephone.\nOnce you have the unit, you can then use it as a mobile phone. The device is really easy to use. You simply plug it into a wall socket and it's ready to go.\nThe Morpheus IEC-2011 has a keyboard, a built-in mouse, a TV tuner, a microphone and a GPS receiver. It has room to store up to 50 phones, or 8GB memory, and will charge up to 200 times in just five hours. This is an interesting concept because you could potentially, if you have 2G or 4G data, use the Morpheus to send texts, emails, video calls and data.\nBy the way, if you already own a Morpheus, the operator will automatically install your phone on to the network for free. The operator is paying for the device, but if you've not got a Morpheus, the operator will pay for the phone as a \"consultation charge\".\nThe content in this article can be found in the following pages.\n", "length": 331, "finished": true}
