- stimulated backscattering in single mode fiber

- counter propagating pump and and signal lasers induce an acoustic
  compression wave via electrostriction. the acoustic wave propagates
  along the fiber and has a frequency of 11GHz
  
- pump and signal must have a frequency difference corresponding to
  the brillouin resonance

- the stronger the pump the stronger the effect

- it is not necessary to have a counterpropagating signal, the
  compression wave can also build up from noise.

- for telecommunication brillouin scattering limits the maximum power
  that can be carried. a fiber with 20dB/km attenuation can only carry
  35mW

- forward scattering is not a shear mode with low frequency shift
  (<2GHz) and not effective in silica SMF. works in photonic crystal
  fibers

- brillouin resonance has linewidth of 30MHz. this is related to the
  phonon lifetime in silica. the line has a lorentzian shape.

- https://youtu.be/GEOAt2QolHA?t=1322 at a certain input power the
  billouin threshold is crossed (and more than 1%) is reflected. above
  this threshold increasing the input power does not increase the
  transmitted power.

- for 0.21dB/km attenuation SMF with a length of 100m, the threshold
  is at 1W input power

- for same fiber at 50km length the threshold is 5mW

- how to cope:

  - vary strain or temperature along fiber to broaden brillouin line
  
    - strain profile can increase threshold +3dB while linear losses
      don't increase

  - vary materials

  - taper area

  - place isolators every 5km along fiber

  - cool fiber with liquid nitrogen, at low temperature Raman
    scattering and Brillouin have less effect (lower number of
    phonons)


- application in measurement

- use dfb laser with narrow linewidth (<100kHz) https://youtu.be/GEOAt2QolHA?t=1782

  - modulate to stokes and antistokes

  - stokes is gain, antistokes is absorption

  - https://youtu.be/GEOAt2QolHA?t=1886

  - temperature coefficient 1MHz/ degree K

  - 1m resolution is possible (with 100ns pump pulse)


- what about polarization? brillouin scattering is very sensitive to
  polarization. they scramble polarization.

  - polarization leading to small oscillation in the diagram
    https://youtu.be/GEOAt2QolHA?t=2889


- increasing resolution is not straight forward. a pump pulse that is
  shorter than the acoustic lifetime in the material (e.g. 5ns)
  broadens the pump spectrum and reduces power injected into brilluoin
  resonance because the bandwidth of the SBS gain process is
  convolution of pump spectrum and brillouin spectrum.

  - solution: use a 5ns phase pulse with pi phase shift inside of a
    100ns pulse, the line will not broaden
  - spatial resolution of 10cm but secondary echoes

  - improved solution: two pulses, one with pi phase shift and one
    without (takes a long time 1hour measurement, 5km with 5cm resolution)

  - brillouin echo distributed sensing (reminds me of MRI experiments
    with spin-echo)


- photonic crystal fiber is out of my scope

- very complicated equations, even with tensors

- https://youtu.be/GEOAt2QolHA?t=4328 FreeFEM++ is mentioned

- https://youtu.be/GEOAt2QolHA?t=4916 here he measures the acoustic
  decay time in silica fibers (11ns) and pcf (6ns). that is quite
  interesting but not brought to a conclusion i will remember.



Based on the video titled "Stimulated Brillouin scattering in optical
fibers: from fundamentals to applications (1)" by Jean-Charles
Beugnot, here's the revised list of bullet points:

- *Introduction to Brillouin Scattering in Optical Fibers* : The
    video begins with an introduction to Brillouin scattering in
    optical fibers, highlighting the similarities in wavelengths
    between optical and elastic waves despite the vast difference in
    frequency.

- *Stimulated Backscattering in Single Mode Fiber* : The video
    discusses stimulated backscattering in single-mode fibers,
    including counter-propagating pump and signal lasers that via
    electrostiction induce an acoustic compression wave with a
    frequency of 11GHz.

- *Brillouin Resonance* : The pump and signal must have a frequency
    difference corresponding to the Brillouin resonance. The stronger
    the pump, the more pronounced the effect.

- *Effect Without Counterpropagating Signal* : It's not necessary to
    have a counterpropagating signal; the compression wave can also
    build up from noise.

- *Telecommunication Limitations* : For telecommunication, Brillouin
    scattering limits the maximum power that can be carried. A fiber
    with 20dB/km attenuation can only carry 35mW.

- *Forward Scattering* : Forward scattering is not a shear mode with
    low frequency shift (<2GHz) and is not effective in silica SMF but
    becomes more important in photonic crystal fibers.

- *Brillouin Resonance Line Width* : The Brillouin resonance has a
    linewidth of 30MHz, related to the phonon lifetime in silica, with
    a Lorentzian shape.

- *Brillouin Threshold* : At a certain input power, the Brillouin
    threshold is crossed, and more than 1% is reflected. Above this
    threshold, increasing the input power does not increase the
    transmitted power.

- *Coping Strategies* : Various strategies to cope with Brillouin
    scattering are presented, including varying strain or temperature,
    using different materials, tapering areas, placing isolators, and
    cooling fibers with liquid nitrogen.

- *Polarization Sensitivity* : Brillouin scattering is very sensitive
    to polarization. Not much else is said about this.

- *Applications in Measurement* : The video explores applications in
    measurement, using DFB lasers with narrow linewidth (<100kHz),
    modulation to stokes and antistokes, and achieving 1m resolution.

- *Increasing Resolution Challenges* : Increasing resolution is not
    straightforward, and various solutions are discussed, including
    using phase pulses and implementing Brillouin echo distributed
    sensing.

- *Photonic Crystal Fiber* : The video briefly mentions photonic
    crystal fiber but this topic is not in my scope and I don't take
    notes.

- *Complex Equations* : The video touches on complex equations,
    including some involving tensors.

- *FreeFEM++ Mentioned* : FreeFEM++ is mentioned in the video.

- *Acoustic Decay Time Measurement* : The video concludes with
    measurements of acoustic decay time in silica fibers (11ns) and
    PCF (6ns), noting that it's interesting but not brought to a
    definitive conclusion.
