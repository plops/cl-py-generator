- stimulated backscattering in single mode fiber

- counter propagating pump and and signal lasers induce an acoustic
  compression wave that propagates along the fiber and has a frequency
  of 11GHz
  
- pump and signal must have a frequency difference corresponding to
  the brillouin ressonance

- the stronger the pump the stronger the effect

- it is not necessary to have a counterpropagating signal, the
  compression wave can also build up from noise.



- forward scattering is not a shear mode with low frequency shift
  (<2GHz) and not effective in silica SMF. works in photonic crystal
  fibers
