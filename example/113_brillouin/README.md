- stimulated backscattering in single mode fiber

- counter propagating pump and and signal lasers induce an acoustic
  compression wave that propagates along the fiber and has a frequency
  of 11GHz
  
- pump and signal must have a frequency difference corresponding to
  the brillouin ressonance

- the stronger the pump the stronger the effect

- it is not necessary to have a counterpropagating signal, the
  compression wave can also build up from noise.

- for telecommunication brillouin scattering limits the maximum power
  that can be carried. a fiber with 20dB/km attenuation can only carry
  35mW



- forward scattering is not a shear mode with low frequency shift
  (<2GHz) and not effective in silica SMF. works in photonic crystal
  fibers



- brillouin resonance has linewidth of 30MHz. this is related to the
  phonon lifetime in silica. the line has a lorentzian shape.


- https://youtu.be/GEOAt2QolHA?t=1322 at a certain input power the
  billouin threshold is crossed (and more than 1%) is reflected. above
  this threshold increasing the input power does not increase the
  transmitted power.
