- Slices work like Python slices, not like VHDL or Verilog slices. The
  first bound is the index of the LSB and is inclusive. The second
  bound is the index of MSB and is exclusive. In V*HDL, bounds are
  MSB:LSB and both are inclusive.
- Cat concatenation: To be consistent with slices, the first signal is
  connected to the bits with the lowest indices in the result. This is
  the opposite of the way the “{}” construct works in Verilog.
