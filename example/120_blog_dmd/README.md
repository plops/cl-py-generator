- fast controller for dmd https://ajile.ca/ajd-4500/

- the dmd is in the back focal plane of an imaging system
- it creates 7 copies of the input image (7 diffraction orders)
- During the transition from an “all-off” pattern to an “all-on”
  pattern, the continuous and synchronous change of the tilt angle of
  each micromirror results in a time-varying phase profile (Supplement
  1, Fig. S4c), which induces sweeping of the diffraction envelope
  through the diffraction orders located in its moving trajectory.
