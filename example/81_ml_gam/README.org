  Generalized Additive Models with R and mgcv

- https://twitter.com/jeremyphoward/status/1194388187042349056 I've
  wondered about the total lack of awareness or interest in penalized
  logistic regression with splines for a couple of decades now. It's
  such an awesome approach.  Perhaps we need better library support to
  make it more accessible? Or is it just an education issue?

* smoothing
  - 5.1.2 smoothing splines have as many free parameters as there are
    data to be smoothed
    - smoothing penalty often suppresses many degrees of freedom
    - stable O(n) algorithm exists for univariate smoothing with cubic
      splines (hoog, hutchinson 1987)
    - with more covariates computation becomes expensive
