Okay, you're right, those logs definitely look like automated vulnerability scanning attempts (specifically targeting PHP vulnerabilities like PHPUnit RCE and potential LFI/RFI). Blocking IPs generating excessive 404s is a good mitigation strategy.

While Nginx itself *can* be configured with modules like `ngx_http_limit_req_module` or Lua scripting to achieve complex rate-limiting and blocking, the most common and robust way to handle this specific scenario (blocking based on log patterns) is using **Fail2ban**.

Fail2ban monitors log files for specific patterns (like repeated 404 errors from the same IP) and automatically updates firewall rules (like iptables, nftables, firewalld) to block the offending IP address for a specified duration.

Here's how you can set it up:

**1. Install Fail2ban**

If you don't have it installed:

*   **Debian/Ubuntu:** `sudo apt update && sudo apt install fail2ban`
*   **CentOS/RHEL:** `sudo yum install epel-release && sudo yum install fail2ban` or `sudo dnf install fail2ban`

Enable and start the service:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable fail2ban
sudo systemctl start fail2ban
```

**2. Create a Custom Fail2ban Filter**

Fail2ban needs to know how to identify the 404 errors from your specific log format. Your format looks like `INFO: <IP>:<PORT> - "Request" 404 Not Found`.

Create a new filter file, for example, `/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/nginx-404.conf`:

```ini
# Fail2Ban filter for Nginx 404 errors (custom log format)
# Example log line: INFO:     180.178.94.73:0 - "GET /..." 404 Not Found

[Definition]

failregex = ^INFO:\s+<HOST>:\d+\s+-\s+".*"\s+404\s+Not Found$

ignoreregex =
```

*   `failregex`: This is the regular expression that matches the log lines indicating a failure. `<HOST>` is a special Fail2ban tag that automatically captures the IP address.
*   `ignoreregex`: Use this if you have specific 404s you *don't* want to count (e.g., common missing assets like `favicon.ico` if they cause issues, though usually not necessary for blocking scanners).

**3. Configure a Fail2ban Jail**

Jails define which filters to use, which logs to monitor, and what actions to take. **Never edit `jail.conf` directly.** Create or edit `/etc/fail2ban/jail.local` to override settings or add new jails. Add the following section to your `jail.local` file:

```ini
[nginx-404]
enabled  = true
port     = http,https
filter   = nginx-404                   # Matches the filter filename nginx-404.conf
logpath  = /path/to/your/nginx/or/app/log.log # <<< IMPORTANT: Change this to the ACTUAL path of the log file shown in your question
maxretry = 15                          # Number of 404s before banning
findtime = 600                         # Time window (in seconds) to detect maxretry (10 minutes)
bantime  = 3600                        # Ban duration (in seconds) (1 hour)
action   = %(action_)s                 # Default action (usually iptables or nftables based on your system)
# Or specify an action explicitly, e.g.:
# action = iptables-multiport[name=nginx-404, port="http,https", protocol=tcp]
# action = nftables-multiport[name=nginx-404, port="http,https"]
# action = firewallcmd-rich-rules[name=nginx-404, port="http,https", protocol=tcp]
```

**Explanation:**

*   `[nginx-404]`: Name of the jail (can be anything descriptive).
*   `enabled = true`: Activates this jail.
*   `port = http,https`: Specifies the ports associated with this service. This is used by some actions.
*   `filter = nginx-404`: Tells Fail2ban to use the filter defined in `/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/nginx-404.conf`.
*   `logpath`: **Crucial!** Replace `/path/to/your/nginx/or/app/log.log` with the actual path to the log file that contains the `INFO: ... 404 Not Found` lines. This might be your main Nginx `access.log`, `error.log`, or potentially an application log if Nginx is proxying. Based on the `INFO:` prefix, it might be an application log rather than the standard Nginx access log. Find where these lines are being written!
*   `maxretry = 15`: The number of times the `failregex` must match within `findtime` for the IP to be banned. Adjust this based on how aggressive you want to be. Lower is more aggressive but increases the chance of banning legitimate users with broken links.
*   `findtime = 600`: The time window (10 minutes) during which `maxretry` occurrences trigger a ban.
*   `bantime = 3600`: How long the IP is banned (1 hour). Use `-1` for a permanent ban (generally not recommended).
*   `action`: Defines what happens when an IP is banned. `%(action_)s` uses Fail2ban's default action. You can specify others like `iptables-multiport`, `nftables-multiport`, or `firewallcmd-rich-rules` depending on your system's firewall.

**4. Test the Filter (Optional but Recommended)**

Before restarting Fail2ban, test your regex against your log file:

```bash
sudo fail2ban-regex /path/to/your/nginx/or/app/log.log /etc/fail2ban/filter.d/nginx-404.conf
```

This command will show you how many lines matched (`Failures`) and which IPs would have been caught. Adjust your `failregex` if needed.

**5. Reload Fail2ban Configuration**

Apply the changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl reload fail2ban
```

Or restart it if reload doesn't work:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart fail2ban
```

**6. Monitor Fail2ban**

Check the status of your jail and see banned IPs:

```bash
sudo fail2ban-client status nginx-404
```

Check the Fail2ban log for errors or activity:

```bash
sudo tail -f /var/log/fail2ban.log
```

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Log File Path:** Getting the `logpath` correct is the most critical step. Double-check where those specific log lines are being written.
*   **Thresholds (`maxretry`, `findtime`, `bantime`):** Tune these values carefully. Too aggressive, and you might block legitimate users or search engine crawlers hitting broken links. Too lenient, and it won't be effective against scanners.
*   **False Positives:** While scanners generate lots of 404s, legitimate users or crawlers might hit a few. Ensure `maxretry` is high enough to avoid blocking them.
*   **Firewall:** Make sure Fail2ban is configured to use the correct firewall action for your system (iptables, nftables, firewalld). Fail2ban usually detects this automatically, but you can specify it in `jail.local` if needed.
*   **IPv6:** Ensure your Fail2ban version and configuration handle IPv6 addresses if your server uses them.

This Fail2ban setup provides a robust way to automatically defend against these kinds of scanning attempts without needing complex Nginx configurations.
