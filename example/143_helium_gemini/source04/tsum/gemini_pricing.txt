Gemini Developer API Pricing


The Gemini API "free tier" is offered through the API service with lower rate limits for testing purposes. Google AI Studio usage is completely free in all available countries. The Gemini API "paid tier" comes with higher rate limits, additional features, and different data handling.

Upgrade to the Paid Tier
If you're looking to reduce costs and your use case doesn't require immediate real-time responses, check out Batch Mode. Batch Mode is designed to process large volumes of requests asynchronously. Requests submitted using this mode are 50% of the price of interactive (non-batch mode) requests.
