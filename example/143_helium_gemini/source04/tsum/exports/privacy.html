        <h1>Privacy Policy for RocketRecap</h1>

        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> September 25, 2025</p>

        <p>Thank you for using the RocketRecap Summarizer Chrome Extension and visiting the rocketrecap.com website (collectively, the "Service"). This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use and share it, and your choices regarding your information.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We collect a minimal amount of information necessary to provide and improve our Service.</p>

        <h3>A. Information You Provide to Us Directly:</h3>
        <p>When you use our Chrome Extension to generate a summary, we collect the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Website Content:</strong> The text content you wish to summarize. This can be either a portion of text you have selected on a webpage or the entire plain text content of a webpage.</li>
            <li><strong>Source URL:</strong> The URL of the webpage or YouTube video you are summarizing.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>B. Information We Collect Automatically:</h3>
        <p>When you send a request to our server, we automatically log the following information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>IP Address:</strong> Your Internet Protocol (IP) address is collected as part of standard server logs.</li>
            <li><strong>Request Timestamp:</strong> The date and time your request was received.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We <strong>do not</strong> use cookies for tracking, and we <strong>do not</strong> require user accounts or collect any other personally identifiable information like your name or email address.</p>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use the information we collect for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>To Provide the Core Service:</strong> The <strong>Website Content</strong> and <strong>Source URL</strong> are used to generate your requested summary. The content is sent to a third-party AI service for this purpose.</li>
            <li><strong>To Display Public Summaries:</strong> The <strong>Source URL</strong> and the final <strong>generated summary</strong> are stored and displayed publicly on our website to show recent activity and provide value to other visitors. <strong>We do not make the original Website Content you submitted publicly visible.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>For Security and Maintenance:</strong> We use automatically collected <strong>IP addresses</strong> and <strong>timestamps</strong> for internal purposes, such as debugging, preventing abuse (e.g., rate limiting), and monitoring the health of our Service. This data is not shared publicly.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. How and Why We Share Your Information</h2>
        <p>We only share your information with the following parties, for the purposes described below:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google's Generative AI Service (Gemini):</strong> To create a summary, the <strong>Website Content</strong> you submit is sent to Google's Gemini API for processing. We do not send your IP address or the Source URL to this service. We encourage you to review <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google's API Privacy Policy</a> to understand how they handle data.</li>
            <li><strong>The Public:</strong> The <strong>Source URL</strong> of the content you summarized and the <strong>AI-generated summary</strong> are made publicly visible on our website.</li>
            <li><strong>Legal Obligations:</strong> We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a legal obligation, protect our rights, or prevent fraud.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We <strong>do not</strong> sell, rent, or transfer your data to any other third parties.</p>

        <h2>4. Data Retention and Security</h2>
        <p>The Source URL and the generated summary are stored indefinitely to be displayed on our website. Internally, server logs containing IP addresses are stored for a limited period for security and operational analysis before being deleted.</p>
        <p>We implement reasonable technical and administrative security measures to protect the information we collect. However, no electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

        <h2>5. Your Choices and Rights</h2>
        <p>As we do not have user accounts, we do not have a system for users to directly access or delete their past submissions. If you have submitted content that you wish to have removed from our public website, please contact us at the email address below with the Source URL and details of your request, and we will review it.</p>

        <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our Service is not directed to individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that we have collected such information, we will take steps to delete it.</p>

        <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Effective Date" at the top. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically.</p>
