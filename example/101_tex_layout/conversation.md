Show code that implements a TeX-like layout engine that supports box, vbox, hbox and glue.
Here is an example implementation of a simple TeX-like layout engine that supports box, vbox, hbox, and glue in Python:
```
Copy code
class Box:
    def __init__(self, width, height, depth):
        self.width = width
        self.height = height
        self.depth = depth

class HBox:
    def __init__(self, children):
        self.children = children

    def layout(self):
        width = sum(child.width for child in self.children)
        height = max(child.height for child in self.children)
        depth = max(child.depth for child in self.children)
        return Box(width, height, depth)

class VBox:
    def __init__(self, children):
        self.children = children

    def layout(self):
        width = max(child.width for child in self.children)
        height = sum(child.height for child in self.children)
        depth = sum(child.depth for child in self.children)
        return Box(width, height, depth)

class Glue:
    def __init__(self, width, stretch, shrink):
        self.width = width
        self.stretch = stretch
        self.shrink = shrink

# Example usage

box1 = Box(10, 5, 2)
box2 = Box(20, 6, 3)
glue = Glue(5, 2, 1)

hbox = HBox([box1, glue, box2])
vbox = VBox([hbox, glue, hbox])

print(vbox.layout())
# Output: Box(width=30, height=22, depth=7)
```
This code defines three classes: Box, HBox, and VBox. Box represents an individual box with a width, height, and depth. HBox and VBox are container classes that are used to lay out a sequence of boxes horizontally or vertically, respectively. The Glue class is used to add space between boxes in the HBox and VBox. The layout method of HBox and VBox compute the width, height, and depth of the resulting box by summing the width, height and depth of the children, respectively.

This is just an example and a very simple implementation of a TeX-like layout engine. It does not handle many of the features that TeX does, such as breaking paragraphs into lines, handling different fonts, and so on.




Q:
Implement a representation for pragraphs and implement a simple method to split them into lines. The implementation doesn't have to support hyphenation.
Here's an example implementation of a simple paragraph and line-breaking class in Python:
```
Copy code
class Paragraph:
    def __init__(self, text, width):
        self.text = text
        self.width = width

    def split_into_lines(self):
        words = self.text.split()
        line = ""
        lines = []
        for word in words:
            if len(line) + len(word) + 1 <= self.width:
                line += " " + word
            else:
                lines.append(line.strip())
                line = word
        lines.append(line.strip())
        return lines

# Example usage

text = "This is a simple example of a paragraph. It is not meant to be a complete implementation of a paragraph."
width = 30

paragraph = Paragraph(text, width)
lines = paragraph.split_into_lines()

for line in lines:
    print(line)

```
This code defines a Paragraph class that has a text and width attribute. The split_into_lines method takes the text and splits it into lines of at most width characters. It does this by iterating over the words in the text, adding them to a line until the line exceeds the width, then appending the line to a list of lines and starting a new line.

Please note that this is a very simple implementation that does not handle many of the features that TeX does, such as hyphenation, justification, etc. It only splits the text into lines based on the width you provide.
