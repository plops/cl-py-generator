Of course. Based on the detailed project documentation, here are several proposals for visualizations using Mermaid diagrams. Each of these diagrams can help clarify the architecture, user flows, and data structures of the RocketRecap v2 application. 

### 1. High-Level Architecture (C4 Model - Component Diagram) 

This diagram will provide a high-level overview of the major components of the RocketRecap v2 application and how they interact. It's an excellent way to visualize the layered architecture described in the "Architecture Design Document". 

**What it should contain:** 

*   **External Systems:** Blocks representing external services like the Google Generative AI API, YouTube, and an OAuth Provider (e.g., Google). 
*   **Application Layers:** Grouped blocks for the Presentation Layer (FastHTML), Service Layer (Business Logic), and Infrastructure Layer. 
*   **Components within Layers:** 
    *   **Presentation Layer:** `Routes (ui, auth, jobs)`, `Middleware`, `UI Components`. 
    *   **Service Layer:** `SummarizationWorkflow`, `AuthService`, `SSEService`, `LocalizationService`. 
    *   **Infrastructure Layer:** `GenAIAdapter`, `TranscriptProvider`, `DatabaseAdapter (Repositories)`. 
*   **Data Flow:** Arrows indicating the primary interactions between these components, for example, `Routes` using `Services`, and `Services` using `Adapters`. 

### 2. User Authentication Flow (Sequence Diagram) 

A sequence diagram is perfect for illustrating the step-by-step process of user authentication via OAuth 2.0. This will clarify the interactions between the user, the RocketRecap application, and the external OAuth provider. 

**What it should contain:** 

*   **Participants:** User, RocketRecap Server (Browser), OAuth Provider (e.g., Google). 
*   **Sequence of Events:** 
    1.  The user clicks "Sign in with Google". 
    2.  The browser sends a request to `/auth/google/login`. 
    3.  The RocketRecap Server redirects the user to the Google consent screen. 
    4.  The user approves the request. 
    5.  Google redirects the user back to the `/auth/google/callback` endpoint with an authorization code. 
    6.  The RocketRecap Server exchanges the code for a user profile with Google. 
    7.  The server uses `AuthService` to find or create a user in the database. 
    8.  The server sets a session cookie. 
    9.  The server redirects the user to the main dashboard. 

### 3. Asynchronous Summarization Process (Sequence Diagram) 

This diagram will visualize the entire asynchronous process of summarizing a video, from the user's initial request to the final streaming of the summary. 

**What it should contain:** 

*   **Participants:** User (Browser), RocketRecap Server, `SummarizationWorkflow` (Background Task), `TranscriptProvider`, `GenAIAdapter`, `SSEService`, PostgreSQL Database. 
*   **Sequence of Events:** 
    1.  The user submits the summarization form to the `/summarize` endpoint. 
    2.  The server creates a job in the database with "PENDING" status. 
    3.  The server starts the `SummarizationWorkflow` as a background task. 
    4.  The workflow calls the `TranscriptProvider` to download the transcript. 
    5.  The workflow updates the job status to "DOWNLOADING" in the database and publishes a status update via `SSEService`. 
    6.  The workflow calls the `GenAIAdapter` to start generating the summary. 
    7.  The workflow updates the job status to "GENERATING". 
    8.  As the `GenAIAdapter` streams back chunks of the summary, the workflow publishes these chunks via `SSEService`. 
    9.  The user's browser, connected to the `/sse/{job_id}` endpoint, receives these events and updates the UI in real-time. 
    10. Once complete, the workflow updates the job status to "COMPLETED" in the database. 

### 4. Database Schema (Entity Relationship Diagram - ERD) 

An ERD will visually represent the database tables and the relationships between them, as detailed in the "Database Layout Proposal". 

**What it should contain:** 

*   **Entities:** Two main tables: `users` and `summary_jobs`. 
*   **Attributes:** The columns for each table, including their data types (e.g., `id BIGINT`, `email TEXT`, `status job_status`). 
*   **Relationships:** A "one-to-many" relationship from `users` to `summary_jobs`, showing that one user can have multiple summary jobs. 
*   **Keys:** Clearly indicate Primary Keys (PK) and Foreign Keys (FK). 

### 5. Job Status Lifecycle (State Diagram) 

A state diagram is ideal for showing the different states a `summary_job` can be in and the transitions between those states. 

**What it should contain:** 

*   **States:** `PENDING`, `DOWNLOADING`, `GENERATING`, `COMPLETED`, `FAILED`. 
*   **Transitions:** Arrows showing the possible paths between states, for example: 
    *   `PENDING` -> `DOWNLOADING` (on job start) 
    *   `DOWNLOADING` -> `GENERATING` (on successful transcript download) 
    *   `GENERATING` -> `COMPLETED` (on successful summary generation) 
    *   Transitions to `FAILED` from `DOWNLOADING` or `GENERATING` if an error occurs. 

### 6. Project Implementation Timeline (Gantt Chart) 

A Gantt chart can be used to plan and visualize the development and implementation timeline for the proposed changes. 

**What it should contain:** 

*   **Tasks:** The major development tasks, such as: 
    *   Setup Project Structure & PostgreSQL 
    *   Implement Core Infrastructure (Database & GenAI Adapters) 
    *   Implement User Authentication (OAuth) 
    *   Implement Core Summarization Workflow & SSE 
    *   Build UI Components & Frontend Integration 
    *   Implement Multi-Language Support 
    *   Testing & Deployment 
*   **Timelines:** The start and end dates or duration for each task. 
*   **Dependencies:** Indicate any dependencies between tasks.
