That's an excellent and critical question. It touches on a common trade-off between prototype simplicity and production-ready performance.

The short answer is: **No, the approach of updating a database field for every single chunk should absolutely not be used with PostgreSQL in the new code.** It is a well-known database anti-pattern that creates significant performance and maintenance problems at scale.

Let's break down why, and then discuss the industry standard approach.

### Analysis of the Prototype's (Anti-Pattern) Approach

The method used in `p04_host.py` was effective for a single-file, single-user prototype for two reasons:
1.  **Simplicity:** It required no extra infrastructure. The database was the single source of truth for both the final state and the in-progress updates.
2.  **State Recovery:** If the server crashed, the partially generated summary was already saved, and a polling client would simply retrieve it.

However, when applied to a production database like PostgreSQL, this pattern is highly detrimental:

1.  **Extreme Write Load:** A generative AI model can stream dozens or even hundreds of chunks per second. Each chunk would trigger a `SELECT` (to get the existing text) and an `UPDATE` operation. This translates to hundreds of write transactions per second for a *single active user*. With multiple users, the database would be overwhelmed by a massive number of small, inefficient writes.
2.  **Table Bloat and VACUUM Overhead (MVCC):** PostgreSQL uses a technology called [MVCC](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/mvcc-intro.html). When you `UPDATE` a row, PostgreSQL doesn't modify it in place. It creates a new version of the row (a "tuple") and marks the old one as expired. A background process called `VACUUM` eventually cleans up these dead tuples. Frequent updates to the same row create enormous amounts of bloat, increasing storage size and forcing `VACUUM` to run constantly, consuming significant I/O and CPU resources.
3.  **Increased Latency:** Each database write has overhead (network round-trip, transaction logging, disk I/O). By making the stream processing wait for a database write for every chunk, you introduce a significant bottleneck and slow down the entire process.
4.  **Architectural Mismatch:** With the move to Server-Sent Events (SSE), the client is no longer polling the database. The primary justification for the original pattern (state recovery for a polling client) is now gone.

### The Industry Standard: Decoupling Streaming from Persistence

The industry standard is to **separate the real-time messaging channel from the durable persistence layer.** Real-time updates should be handled by a system designed for low-latency, high-throughput messaging, while the database is used to store the final, complete state (or periodic checkpoints).

For an application of this scale, the best-practice is an **in-memory message bus (Pub/Sub)** combined with **batched database writes**.

### Proposed Architecture for RocketRecap v2

Here is the recommended workflow, which leverages an in-memory channel for real-time updates and treats the database correctly:

1.  **Initiation:** When a summary job begins, the `SummarizationWorkflow` background task is started.

2.  **In-Memory Communication Channel:** An in-memory message queue or Pub/Sub topic is created specifically for this job (e.g., using `asyncio.Queue` or a library like `aioredis`'s Pub/Sub if scaling across multiple servers is a future goal).

3.  **Streaming and Publishing:**
    *   The `SummarizationWorkflow` receives a chunk of text (or a "thinking" update) from the GenAI API.
    *   Instead of writing to PostgreSQL, it **publishes** this chunk to the in-memory channel for that job ID.
    *   Simultaneously, it appends the chunk to a simple list or buffer *in its own memory*.

4.  **SSE Delivery:**
    *   The user's browser is connected to the `/sse/{job_id}` endpoint.
    *   This SSE handler is a **subscriber** to the in-memory channel. When a message (a new chunk) appears, the handler immediately formats it as an SSE message and sends it to the client. This is extremely fast as it involves no disk I/O.

5.  **Batched/Checkpoint Database Writes:**
    *   The `SummarizationWorkflow` does not write to the database on every chunk. Instead, it flushes its local buffer to the `summary_markdown` column in PostgreSQL periodically.
    *   This can be triggered by a timer (e.g., every 5 seconds) or by buffer size (e.g., every 50 chunks).
    *   This approach reduces hundreds of potential `UPDATE` statements into one. It uses a single `UPDATE summary_jobs SET summary_markdown = summary_markdown || %s WHERE id = %s` statement to append the batched text.

6.  **Finalization:**
    *   When the AI stream is complete, the `SummarizationWorkflow` performs a final flush of its buffer to the database.
    *   It then issues a final `UPDATE` to set the `status` to `'COMPLETED'`, save the `completed_at` timestamp, and store the final token counts and costs.

### Comparison Table

| Metric | Prototype Method (Update per Chunk) | Proposed Method (In-Memory Bus + Batching) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Performance** | **Very Poor.** High latency, database becomes the bottleneck. | **Excellent.** Low-latency client updates at memory speed. |
| **Scalability** | **Very Poor.** Fails with even a few concurrent users. | **Good.** Scales well with concurrent users. |
| **Database Load**| **Extremely High.** Hundreds of writes per second per user. | **Very Low.** One write every few seconds per user. |
| **Durability** | High (every chunk is saved). | **Good.** A crash might lose a few seconds of unsaved buffer. |
| **Complexity** | Low (deceptively simple). | Moderate (requires managing a queue and buffer). |

**Conclusion:** Adopting an in-memory Pub/Sub model for real-time streaming and using batched writes for persistence is the correct, industry-standard approach. It aligns perfectly with the new SSE architecture, ensures the PostgreSQL database remains healthy and performant, and builds a foundation that can scale effectively as the application grows.
