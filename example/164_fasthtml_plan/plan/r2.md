Of course. Here is a plan for the requested changes:

### 1. Generative AI API Migration

First, I will replace the deprecated `google.generativeai` API in `p04_host.py` with the modern `genai` client, mirroring the implementation in `p02_impl.py`. This involves updating the model initialization, request construction, and response handling to align with the new API's streaming and asynchronous features.

### 2. Database Migration to PostgreSQL

Next, I will migrate the application's data persistence from SQLite to PostgreSQL. This will require replacing the `sqlite_minutils` library with an appropriate asynchronous PostgreSQL driver like `asyncpg`. All database operations, including table creation, insertion, updates, and queries, will be rewritten using asynchronous functions to leverage the performance benefits of PostgreSQL in a concurrent environment.

### 3. Implement Server-Sent Events (SSE)

To provide real-time updates without constant client-side polling, I will replace the existing HTMX polling mechanism with Server-Sent Events (SSE). This will involve creating a new SSE endpoint that streams summary generation progress to the client. The front-end will be updated to use the HTMX SSE extension, which will listen for these events and dynamically update the user interface as new data arrives.

### 4. Form Handling with Dataclasses

I will refactor the form processing logic to use Python dataclasses. This will enable automatic data binding from incoming form submissions to typed dataclass objects, simplifying validation and making the code cleaner and more maintainable.

### 5. Multi-Language Support

To make the application accessible to a wider audience, I will add support for multiple output languages. This will include:

*   Adding a language selection dropdown to the user interface.
*   Translating user interface instructions and labels into several languages.
*   Modifying the prompt sent to the generative AI model to request the summary in the user's selected language.

### 6. User Authentication and OAuth

I will implement a user authentication system. The initial phase will be a simple login for a single administrative user. Subsequently, I will expand this to include OAuth 2.0, allowing users to sign in with their existing accounts from providers like Google. This will involve session management and protecting relevant routes to ensure that only authenticated users can access them.

### 7. Asynchronous AI Responses with Thinking

Finally, I will enhance the user experience by leveraging the asynchronous capabilities of the Google GenAI API, including the "thinking" feature for supported models. This will allow the application to stream intermediate "thinking" states from the model to the user, providing feedback that the request is being processed, even before the final summary is available. This will be integrated with the SSE implementation for a seamless, real-time experience.
