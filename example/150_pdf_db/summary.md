    * *46:12 SQL as an API:* Datasette exposes an API endpoint for executing SQL queries, arguing that this is safe and flexible for read-only published databases. 
* *48:48 Datasette Plugins:* Willison highlights the extensive plugin ecosystem of Datasette:
    * *49:23 Installing plugins:* `dataset install dataset-cluster-map`
    * *49:53 The Value of Plugins:*  Plugins enable community-driven feature development.
    * *50:24 `dataset-cluster-map`:*  Demonstrates a plugin that automatically creates a map for tables with latitude and longitude data.
* *55:18 SQLite Utils:* Willison introduces SQLite Utils, his command-line tool and Python library for manipulating SQLite databases, demonstrating how to:
    * *55:32 Insert data from CSV:*  `sqlite-utils insert manatees.db locations ... -csv -d` 
    * *57:01 View database schema:* `sqlite-utils schema manatees.db`
    * *57:12 Exploring Data in Datasette:*  Willison loads the newly created database into Datasette to visualize and explore the Manatee carcass data.
    * *59:55 Transform command:* `sqlite-utils transform ... ` to refactor tables, rename columns, drop columns, and reassign primary keys.
    * *59:55 Normalizing Data:*  Uses SQLite Utils to extract unique mortality codes into a separate table and create a foreign key relationship, illustrating data normalization techniques. 
    * *59:55 Convert command:*  `sqlite-utils convert ...` to modify data within columns using Python expressions, such as converting date formats. 
* *1:07:06 SQLite Utils as a Python Library:* Willison transitions to a Jupyter notebook to demonstrate using SQLite Utils as a Python library, showing how to:
    * *1:07:11 Create a database:*  `db = sqlite_utils.Database('peps.db')`
    * *1:07:54 Parse PEP data:* Imports a function to parse PEP files into dictionaries.
    * *1:08:01 Insert data with `insert_all`:*  `db['peps']-dot-insert_all(peps, pk='pep', alter=True)`
    * *1:08:52 Exploring PEPs in Datasette:* Loads the newly created PEP database into Datasette for browsing and faceting. 
    * *1:09:49 Integrating with Pandas:* `pd.read_sql('SELECT * FROM peps', db.conn)` to create a Pandas DataFrame from the SQLite data.
    * *1:10:55 Full-Text Search (FTS):*  `db['peps'].enable_fts(['title', 'body'])` to enable SQLite's built-in FTS5 extension.
