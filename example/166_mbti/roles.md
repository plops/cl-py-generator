*Abstract:*

This video provides a concise and accessible introduction to the eight cognitive functions central to Jungian typology and the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI). The presenter, Joyce Meng, systematically defines each function, offering a simple "cheat sheet" phrase followed by a more detailed explanation of its core characteristics. The functions are divided into two categories: perceiving functions, which dictate how individuals process information (Si, Ni, Se, Ne), and judging functions, which describe how they make decisions (Fi, Ti, Te, Fe). For each function, the video identifies the personality types that use it as their dominant function, making it an ideal primer for those new to personality theory or seeking a clear refresher on these foundational concepts.

*A Quick Guide to the 8 Cognitive Functions*

*   *0:11 Introverted Sensing (Si):* Defined as a "detailed representation of reality in your mind." Si focuses on storing concrete experiences in a subjective way, valuing consistency, routine, and predictability to create a sense of stability and security. It is the dominant function for *ISTJ* and *ISFJ* types.
*   *1:28 Introverted Intuition (Ni):* Defined as an "essential knowing of future reality." Ni involves taking a wide-angle view and narrowing down possibilities to predict the most likely outcome or consequence of an action. It's often described as a gut sense about how events will unfold. It is the dominant function for *INFJ* and *INTJ* types.
*   *2:40 Extraverted Sensing (Se):* Defined as "reality as it is." Se is focused on objectively perceiving the concrete world in the present moment. This function allows users to be highly engaged with their immediate surroundings and see what is relevant in any given situation. It is the dominant function for *ESTP* and *ESFP* types.
*   *3:44 Extraverted Intuition (Ne):* Defined as an "expansion of ideas to push the limits of possibility." Ne loves to brainstorm, explore connections, and generate multiple possibilities from a single starting point. The focus is on the excitement of exploration, regardless of practicality. It is the dominant function for *ENTP* and *ENFP* types.
*   *4:35 Introverted Feeling (Fi):* Defined as "truth of the soul, refined values." Fi is tuned into an individual's personal values and internal emotional state, determining what resonates or feels dissonant. Decisions are made based on what aligns with this internal sense of right and wrong. It is the dominant function for *INFP* and *ISFP* types.
*   *5:19 Introverted Thinking (Ti):* Defined as "truth of the mind, refined principles." Ti seeks to understand how things work by breaking them down into their core components. It builds an internal framework of logical principles that are true beyond dispute for the individual. It is the dominant function for *INTP* and *ISTP* types.
*   *6:02 Extraverted Thinking (Te):* Defined as the "application of logic to reach measurable goals." Te focuses on structuring the external environment for efficiency and order. It uses logic to create systems, organize resources, and achieve tangible, measurable outcomes. It is the dominant function for *ESTJ* and *ENTJ* types.
*   *6:41 Extraverted Feeling (Fe):* Defined as the "finesse of shared feeling to reach mutually fulfilling relationships and emotional equilibrium." Fe is focused on social harmony, consensus, and the emotional needs of the group. It is skilled at monitoring the social environment and acting to maintain interpersonal balance and inclusivity. It is the dominant function for *ESFJ* and *ENFJ* types.
